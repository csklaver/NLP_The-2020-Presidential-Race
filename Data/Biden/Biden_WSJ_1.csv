WASHINGTON—Sen. Susan Collins said President Trump's efforts
to press Ukraine to open an investigation
into a Democratic presidential candidate were ""improper and demonstrated poor judgment"" but didn't warrant forcing him from office, joining a handful of Republican lawmakers who have criticized his actions while arguing they aren't impeachable.
""I do not believe that the House has met its burden of showing that the president's conduct, however flawed, warrants the extreme step of immediate removal from office,"" said the Maine senator, who faces a tough re-election battle, in a speech Tuesday on the Senate floor.
The GOP-controlled Senate is expected to acquit Mr. Trump in a final vote Wednesday afternoon on two articles of impeachment alleging abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Conviction would require a two-thirds majority, or 67 senators, and Senate Republicans have remained united in rejecting Democrats' impeachment push.
But Ms. Collins and a number of other GOP senators have criticized Mr. Trump's conduct in strong terms on the Senate floor, in op-eds and in remarks to reporters in recent days. Their disapproval is focused on a July 25 phone call in which Mr. Trump asked Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky for an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, who is currently seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, and his son Hunter. Mr. Trump has defended the call as ""perfect"" and has said he did nothing wrong regarding Ukraine, dismissing the impeachment process as a partisan hoax.
""The president's actions were not 'perfect.' Some were inappropriate,"" said Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) in
an opinion article published in the Philadelphia Inquirer
on Tuesday. He said the actions didn't rise to an impeachable offense.
Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) condemned Mr. Trump's July call as ""inappropriate and wrong"" in a speech on the Senate floor on Tuesday. ""While I don't condone this behavior, these actions do not rise to removing the president from office and taking him off the ballot in a presidential election year that is already well under way,"" he said.

""The president's behavior was shameful and wrong,"" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska) in her own speech on Monday night. ""His personal interests do not take precedence over those of this great nation.""
In her speech on Tuesday, Ms. Collins said: ""It was wrong for President Trump to mention former Vice President Joe Biden on that phone call, and it was wrong for him to ask a foreign country to investigate a political rival.""
Mr. Trump and his GOP allies have alleged that it was corrupt for Mr. Biden during the Obama administration to seek the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had once investigated a Ukrainian gas company where Hunter Biden sat on the board. Mr. Biden sought the prosecutor's removal as part of a broad international effort to combat corruption in Ukraine.
The Bidens have denied any wrongdoing.
Hunter Biden has said it was poor judgment
on his part to serve on the Burisma board while his father was involved with Ukraine policy as vice president.
In her speech on Tuesday, Ms. Collins also reminded listeners that she had voted to acquit former President Clinton, a Democrat, in his impeachment trial in 1999.
""This decision is not about whether you like or dislike this president, or agree with or oppose his policies,"" she said. ""Rather it is about whether the charges meet the very high constitutional standard of treason, bribery or other high crimes or misdemeanors."" She said Mr. Trump's actions didn't meet that threshold.
After her speech, Ms. Collins told reporters she might have been open to censuring Mr. Trump,
a proposal floated by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin
of West Virginia. Republican Senate leaders have dismissed this idea.
""It's something that I would have looked at. At this point, the fact is the president has been impeached—only the third president to be actually impeached,"" Ms. Collins said. ""That both Republican senators such as myself and Democratic senators have criticized his conduct strikes me as a reprimand.""
Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who also has said Mr. Trump's conduct was inappropriate, told reporters on Tuesday that he hopes the refusal of GOP senators to convict and remove Mr. Trump will discourage future Houses from sending impeachment articles to the Senate that don't have bipartisan support.

PARIS—Mayor Anne Hidalgo was on the stump in an outdoor market, seeking a second term, but there was no pressing the flesh with the public—and certainly no cheek-to-cheek kisses.
""I say to Parisians, I would love to kiss them and take them in my arms, but I cannot do it because I need to lead by example,"" the 60-year old mayor said on a recent morning.
French politicians have long prided themselves on their willingness to get up close and personal with voters, greeting supporters with a peck on the cheek or wading into crowds. In recent weeks, however, Ms. Hidalgo and her rivals have begun to keep their distance, in some cases canceling campaign events.
Politicians from many countries are learning to make similar adjustments—including candidates campaigning in the
U.S. presidential primary elections
. Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden canceled rallies in Cleveland, ahead of Ohio's primary next week, citing concerns about the coronavirus. The British government Friday said local elections in England, including the ballot to select London's mayor, will be postponed for a year.
Voters across France are preparing to hit the polls in two rounds of local elections on March 15 and 22 just as France is coping with a sharp increase in the number of infections.
So far , authorities have identified 3,661 cases across the country, and 79 patients infected with the virus have died. While voting is going ahead as planned—French President Emmanuel Macron decided to proceed after consulting with a team of scientists on Thursday—authorities are urging candidates to forego shaking hands and give up the bise, as the greeting by kiss is called.
Ms. Hidalgo has a lot riding on this election. She's among the last members of the Socialist Party to hold a major office after the party was stung by a string of defeats in the 2017 presidential and National Assembly elections.
But so does Mr. Macron. His centrist party, Republic on the Move, gambled in its decision to tap French Health Minister Agnès Buzyn to run for mayor of Paris on Feb. 16 after Mr. Macron's initial choice
abruptly quit the race
following allegations he had sent a woman sexually explicit messages, just as the coronavirus was beginning to course through France.
""It breaks my heart to leave, but I will be up to the task,"" said Ms. Buzyn, a trained physician, when she accepted the candidacy.
But the sudden substitution put an immediate target on her back.
""Why didn't you stay at the health ministry?"" Ms. Hidalgo asked Ms. Buzyn during a recent televised debate, adding that ""it seems like a shame to leave at this point.""
""Maybe it was a presidential instruction?"" said Cédric Villani, a celebrated mathematician and lawmaker from Mr. Macron's party who has defied the president by refusing to drop out of the mayoral race.
""Because I want to be mayor, that's why I left the health ministry,"" Ms. Buzyn responded.
Mr. Macron and his party, Republic on the Move, triumphed in the 2017 elections, but establishing local roots through contests such as the Paris mayoral election is essential to its long-term survival. Municipalities and other local governments provide a power base for political parties. Government ministers are allowed to run for local posts such as mayor, providing them with a political fallback if they lose national office. Local officials also elect lawmakers in the Senate, where Republic on the Move is in the minority.
Polls show Ms. Hidalgo in the lead with 26% of the vote while Ms. Buzyn 19% and Mr. Villani has 7%.
The coronavirus epidemic makes for a challenging campaign, with difficult decisions to make. On Tuesday, center-right candidate Rachida Dati, who is polling at 23%, decided to go ahead with her own rally. She made a point of counting supporters who lined up at the entrance, limiting the crowd inside to 900 people—just under the 1,000 allowed under public health restrictions at the time. The limit was lowered to 100 people Friday.
Meanwhile, Ms. Buzyn remains focused on meeting Parisians, and tries to make the best of a bad situation. Instead of kissing or shaking their hands, she bumps elbows with Parisians in cafes and markets.
When offered a hand or a cheek, Ms. Buzyn explains it is ill-advised, adding: ""Parisians will change their ways.""

NASHUA, N.H.—Democrats in search of a centrist nominee to challenge President Trump are increasingly worried after contests in
Iowa
and
New Hampshire
consolidated liberal support behind Bernie Sanders and divided the larger moderate vote among multiple candidates.
The party's center lane is crowded with the rising former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Vice President Joe Biden. Looming in the
March 3 Super Tuesday states
and beyond is former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, buoyed by
campaign spending that dwarfs all his opponents combined
.
With no clear centrist front-runner, vulnerable freshman Democrats in Congress are texting each other anxiously, a Biden-allied fundraiser warns of a ""doomsday scenario"" and party strategists fret about what mixed early-state turnout means for November.
Predictions about which candidates are the most electable and which will prevail through a long primary season have proven unreliable in the past, particularly at this early stage of the process, before voting in the diverse states of South Carolina and Nevada. Barack Obama faced intraparty doubts in 2008, as did Mr. Trump in 2016.
With multiple contenders vowing to stay in the race, party leaders are yet again bracing for the likelihood of a protracted fight for the nomination that may not be settled by the time of the July convention in Milwaukee.
Adding to some Democrats' worries is the president's
acquittal from impeachment
and his strength among his most fervent supporters, as evidenced by the more than 11,000 who turned out for his
Monday night rally in Manchester, N.H.
, a larger crowd than any assembled by a Democrat campaigning in the state.
""There is one thing that's universal, and that is anxiety,"" said Rufus Gifford, who served as finance director for President Obama's re-election campaign and has contributed to several campaigns.

The fear among some Democrats is predicated on the idea that Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator and self-described democratic socialist, would struggle to defeat Mr. Trump in November. Mr. Sanders and his supporters believe the party could unite around him if he is the nominee and that he could energize young voters and those in crucial Rust Belt states who swung to the GOP in 2016.
The Sanders campaign disputed the notion he would hurt Democrats in swing districts, noting that candidates in states that will be crucial in 2020 had requested his help during 2018 midterms.
Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg, a 38-year-old newcomer to the national scene, essentially tied in Iowa and finished one-two in New Hampshire. Ms. Warren has faded in the first two contests but is pressing forward, while Ms. Klobuchar, the No. 3 finisher in Iowa, is eyeing delegates when her home state of Minnesota votes on March 3.
If Mr. Biden has a strong showing in South Carolina and Nevada, he could regain lost momentum and potentially persuade wavering Democrats to stick with him through subsequent states.
Mr. Bloomberg meanwhile has poured more than $350 million of his fortune into a series of March states, including California, Texas and North Carolina.
Philip Levine, a former mayor of Miami Beach, Fla., who supports Mr. Bloomberg, said in an interview he received ""an avalanche"" of phone calls and emails Wednesday from donors asking how they could help, and from elected officials, whom he didn't name, asking his advice on ""how to tactfully retract"" their endorsements of Mr. Biden and shift their support to Mr. Bloomberg.
Some Democratic donors say privately there will be a lot of pressure for Mr. Biden to get out after South Carolina if he performs poorly there.
""We are going to compete in Super Tuesday states,"" said Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a Biden campaign co-chairman. ""Bloomberg is spending an awful lot of money, but he's also not had his turn in the barrel. He has not been on the debate stage. He's untested.""
Larry Rasky, who leads a pro-Biden super PAC called Unite the Country, sought to rally Biden donors in a fundraising memo Sunday by telling them that if they hedge their bets on Mr. Biden because of Mr. Bloomberg, they could be creating a ""doomsday scenario.""
""The Sanders-Warren wing of the Party is ready for the Bloomberg fight. Democrats cannot afford a split Convention. Do you really think the Sanders voters wing will support Mike Bloomberg? Do you think all the camps who have busted their butts and played by the rules will happily sign on"" to Mr. Bloomberg's campaign, he wrote.
The party's attempt to present itself as a steady, competent alternative to Mr. Trump has been
marred by the chaotic Iowa caucuses
, where more than a week later Mr. Sanders narrowly trails Mr. Buttigieg in state delegates, but Mr. Sanders leads in the popular vote. Both candidates have requested a recanvassing of certain precincts.
Party strategists are watching early-state turnout closely for clues about whether Democrats are energized to vote.

More than 176,000 people participated in the Iowa Democratic caucuses this year, a slight increase from four years ago but well behind the nearly 240,000 who caucused in 2008. New Hampshire was a brighter spot for Democrats: Turnout reached about 297,000 voters in the Democratic primary, compared with about 255,000 in 2016 and nearly 290,000 in 2008.
""Everything is splintered,"" said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist and former adviser to West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. ""And it just shows that voters aren't falling in love with any of these candidates, and that's a problem.""
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who has conducted focus groups in early-voting states and general-election battlegrounds, said she has been struck by ""the duality of who you like and who you think can beat Trump. And they're not necessarily the same thing.""

In a sign of Democrats' interest in finding an alternative to Mr. Biden, some moderate House Democrats have embraced Mr. Bloomberg, including Reps. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Haley Stevens of Michigan and Scott Peters of California. On Wednesday, two African-American members of Congress, Reps. Lucy McBath (D., Ga.) and Gregory Meeks (D., N.Y.) said they were backing Mr. Bloomberg. All are members of the centrist New Democrat Coalition.
Rep. Stephanie Murphy, the chairwoman of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition caucus, said Mr. Sanders wouldn't be able to win over swing voters, and if he becomes the party's nominee, he could put the new House majority at risk. ""For many moderate districts and Trump-won districts, Bernie Sanders at the top of the ticket would create headwinds for house members running for re-election,"" she said.

Former Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, who supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, said in a tweet Tuesday that ""Sanders is just as polarizing as Trump AND he'll ruin our economy."" Mr. Sanders's campaign manager tweeted back: ""This is what panic from the Wall Street elite looks and sounds like.""
For most of the campaign, Mr. Biden has presented himself as the candidate best able to win states narrowly carried by Mr. Trump, including his boyhood state of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.
""He did not have a shot to win Iowa or do well in Iowa,"" said Rep. Tim Ryan (D., Ohio), who endorsed Mr. Biden after his own candidacy failed. ""His two strongest groups are communities of color and older voters, and both are pretty much excluded from the caucus process.""
Mr. Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, joined a conference call with the campaign's top financial donors on Wednesday afternoon, according to three participants, and noted the campaign's strength in Nevada and South Carolina among Latinos and African-Americans.
Polls indicate that Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar both have struggled to appeal to African-American voters. Mr. Bloomberg apologized for a second time Tuesday amid a fresh round of criticism for his support of stop-and-frisk policing in New York City.
Mr. Sanders has argued that Democrats must nominate someone who can generate enthusiasm and mobilize young people and infrequent voters who were turned off by their choices in the 2016 election. The senator has arguably the best ability to command large crowds, evidenced by more than 7,500 people who showed up for a primary eve rally and concert at the University of New Hampshire.
In the last week, Mr. Sanders has taken the lead in the RealClearPolitics average of national Democratic primary polls, after Mr. Biden had led for months.
While Mr. Biden's candidacy has foundered, Mr. Bloomberg has courted members of Congress. In January, Mr. Bloomberg flew to Salt Lake City where Rep. Ben McAdams (D., Utah) hosted the former mayor at his home with local Democrats and Republicans. Mr. Bloomberg talked about his hope for a pragmatic government and answered questions on climate change and fiscal responsibility.
Mr. McAdams said he was looking for someone he could support, but also said he was looking for someone who understood a congressional district like his own, which the president carried by 7 percentage points in 2016.
About a week later, he endorsed Mr. Bloomberg.

WASHINGTON -- The Republican-led Senate acquitted President Trump of charges stemming from his efforts to press Ukraine to announce investigations that would benefit him politically, bringing to a close a bruising four-month battle fought almost entirely along party lines.
The third presidential impeachment in U.S. history intensified the nation's sharp divide over Mr. Trump and previewed many of the arguments likely to be heard ahead of the election this fall. During the trial, Democrats said the Republican president was trying to cheat in the coming election by trying to damage a potential opponent. Republicans said that Democrats were improperly inflating missteps into impeachable offenses and trying to overturn the results of the 2016 election.
The Senate vote to acquit marked a clear victory for the president, underscoring his primacy in the GOP and the end to a process that had hung over the past several months of his presidency. But while Mr. Trump had hoped for a forceful display of unity from Republicans in defense of his actions, he got something less: GOP senators strongly supported his acquittal, but several said the Democrats had proved that he acted improperly -- though not in a manner deserving of impeachment -- regarding Ukraine.
Mr. Trump was also denied a unanimous not-guilty verdict from Republican senators when Mitt Romney of Utah voted to convict on the first article of impeachment.
Given the GOP's 53-47 majority in the Senate and the Constitution's requirement that two-thirds of the Senate is required to convict, Mr. Trump's chance of acquittal was always strong. Mr. Trump now becomes the first president to run for re-election after having been impeached.
Mr. Trump and his campaign sought throughout the process to turn impeachment to his political advantage, frequently using his attacks on the investigation in fundraising emails.
On the first article of impeachment, abuse of power, all 47 Democratic-aligned senators and Mr. Romney voted to convict, falling short of the 67 needed to remove the president from office. On the obstruction of Congress article, the vote also failed, with all Democrats and no Republicans finding the president guilty.
The senators read their votes aloud from their desks, and Chief Justice John Roberts announced the outcome. ""Donald John Trump, president of the United States. . .is hereby acquitted,"" he said.
Mr. Trump, in a tweet after the vote, declared ""our Country's VICTORY on the Impeachment Hoax"" and wrote that he would make a public statement about his acquittal on Thursday.
Republicans' arguments in favor of acquittal split broadly into two camps. Some argued that House impeachment managers' case was half-baked and that they should have gone to court to pursue the testimony of further witnesses who had been told by the White House not to cooperate. Others in the party said House Democrats had proved their case but that the president's conduct wasn't impeachable.
The impeachment probe grew out of a phone call last summer in which Mr. Trump asked President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to announce an investigation into Joe Biden, a top Democratic presidential contender, while holding up congressionally approved aid to the country. Mr. Trump has defended the call as ""perfect"" and has said he did nothing wrong regarding Ukraine. The aid was later released after bipartisan outcry from lawmakers.
The most dramatic moment of the day came two hours before the acquittal vote, when Mr. Romney said in a floor speech that he had decided to vote to convict the president on the first article. ""The president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust,"" he said.
Mr. Romney was the first senator in U.S. history to vote to convict a president of his own party. In the impeachment trials of Democratic presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, no Democratic senators voted to convict.
The White House, which as late as Wednesday morning had been predicting that all Republican senators would vote to acquit the president, was caught off-guard by Mr. Romney's announcement, aides said.
Immediately after Mr. Romney announced his vote, White House aides began planning to intensify attacks on the senator. Later that evening, Mr. Trump tweeted a video accusing Mr. Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, of ""posing as a Republican"" and trying to ""infiltrate"" the Trump administration.
Democrats said the acquittal amounted to a defeat for the institution of Congress and they warned that leaving Mr. Trump in office would make him free to abuse power again.
""The verdict of this kangaroo court will be meaningless,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, on Wednesday. ""You cannot be on the side of this president and be on the side of truth.""
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Democrats used impeachment for political goals. ""We should all agree that this is the precisely the type of recklessness that the Senate was created to stop,"" he said on the floor. ""The response to losing one election cannot be to attack the office of the presidency.""
In a news conference later in the day, Mr. McConnell declined to answer questions about whether he found the president's conduct appropriate.
In the months after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) opened the inquiry in September, the Democratic-led House called 17 witnesses and compiled hundreds of documents to build its case, formally impeaching the president in December. A month later, it handed the articles over to the Senate, which heard arguments from House impeachment managers and Mr. Trump's defense team but rejected calling witnesses it said the House should have pursued.
The tightly choreographed Senate trial was upended late last month by new revelations from former national security adviser John Bolton about the president's pressure campaign on Ukraine. The former official's revelations in a yet-unpublished memoir briefly raised the possibility a sufficient number of Republicans would join with Democrats to vote in favor of new witness testimony. But Republicans ultimately voted nearly in unison to oppose hearing from Mr. Bolton and other witnesses.
""Unless there's some bipartisan consensus of treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors, as there was in the Nixon case, then there shouldn't be an impeachment,"" Sen. Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.) said on Tuesday.
While a majority of voters in a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll said they believed Mr. Trump abused his power and obstructed Congress, some 49% of respondents said he should be allowed to finish his term, compared with 46% who said he should be removed.
Impeachment also made little impact on Mr. Trump's job-approval rating, which stood at 46% in the January poll -- in line with his rating throughout his presidency.
Democrats made clear the trial settled nothing for them, with members of House leadership saying they would likely keep investigating. Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) said Wednesday the House would likely subpoena Mr. Bolton and continue the investigation. Mr. Bolton's spokeswoman declined to comment on whether he would comply with any subpoena.
Despite his public attacks on the impeachment process, Mr. Trump stayed -- at Mr. McConnell's urging -- largely on the sidelines of Republican efforts to rally lawmakers against voting for new witnesses and approached his own legal team with a fairly light touch.
The president's sole recommendation to his team came after the defense's first day of arguments, an administration official said. After his lawyers argued for two hours, he called with a request: Put Pam Bondi on TV more. He told the team he wanted Ms. Bondi, a former Florida attorney general who joined the White House last fall as an adviser on impeachment, to continue arguing his case on TV in the evenings.
Instead, Mr. Trump focused his attention elsewhere. As the trial unfolded last week, White House officials huddled with GOP House members and their aides in a small room in the vice president's office in the Capitol that one GOP aide described as ""mission control."" The president, the aide said, insisted advisers not call it a ""war room,"" which he said wrongly suggested Republicans were embattled and that impeachment was an actual crisis.

Michael Bloomberg said he would transfer $18 million from his presidential campaign to the Democratic National Committee, boosting the party's operations instead of forming his own super PAC.
The investment is aimed at strengthening the DNC's battleground program, which includes 12 states and is run in coordination with the state party committees. Mr. Bloomberg has also offered to transfer the ownership of many of his field offices to state party committees, according to a Democratic official, who said that the former New York City mayor's contributions would help speed up their hiring for positions in organizing, data and operations.
The multimillion-dollar boost to the party's field organizing program could serve as a
major asset to the Democratic nominee
. Former Vice President Joe Biden is leading the delegate count and has struggled to amass a large campaign war chest. Sen. Bernie Sanders is still in the race, but Mr. Biden's campaign is preparing to build out a larger staff for the general election while grappling with the new realities of campaigning during the coronavirus pandemic.
President Trump's team has built a large campaign organization and
is planning an extensive operation of field organizers
and digital outreach to voters. Mr. Trump and the Republican National Committee had more than $225 million in the bank at the end of February.
After launching his long-shot White House bid in late November, Mr. Bloomberg committed to keeping his staff on the payroll and field offices open in at least six competitive general-election states, even if he wasn't the party's nominee.
The billionaire
dropped out
after giving his own campaign more than $935 million, an unprecedented amount in just 100 days, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission on Friday that show his spending through the end of February. He earned only 61 delegates on Super Tuesday, meaning he spent at least $15.3 million per delegate.
Since he exited the race, Mr. Bloomberg's advisers had been working on a way to absorb his campaign operations into an outside entity that would boost Mr. Biden. He said in the statement Friday they had ultimately decided to change course.
""While we considered creating our own independent entity to support the nominee and hold the President accountable, this race is too important to have many competing groups with good intentions but that are not coordinated and united in strategy and execution,"" Mr. Bloomberg wrote in a memo to DNC Chairman Tom Perez that was made public Friday.
""The dynamics of the race have also fundamentally changed, and it is critically important that we all do everything we can to support our eventual nominee and scale the Democratic Party's general-election efforts,"" Mr. Bloomberg said.
The shift in thinking was fueled by a few factors, according to a campaign aide. Mr. Bloomberg and his advisers had been expecting a more prolonged primary contest and believed a new outside group could keep the focus on anti-Trump efforts while the remaining candidates battled for the nomination, the aide said.
But with Mr. Biden appearing on track to secure the nomination, they started at looking at ways of funding more coordinated efforts to support his campaign and discovered the presidential campaign could make an unlimited contribution to the DNC.
While individuals have limits on how much they can give to party committees, presidential campaign committees can transfer unlimited amounts—even if they are solely funded, as in Mr. Bloomberg's case, by one person.
In a roughly six-minute phone call with staffers, Dan Kanninen, states director for the campaign, said Mr. Bloomberg's team had considered what his general-election operation might look like, but was more focused on competing on Super Tuesday, according to a person on the call. Mr. Kanninen said
Mr. Biden's performance that day
changed their calculation.
""An independent effort would simply not be as effective or as efficient in our goal of beating President Trump in November,"" Mr. Kanninen said, according to a person on the call. ""I want to be clear: It was impossible for us to predict the events of last month politically.""
The aide said that
the coronavirus outbreak
also played a role in changing their plans. Although some of the field work conducted by Mr. Bloomberg's staffers in battleground states can still be done through digital platforms and phone banking, campaigns will be unable to carry out one of their biggest organizing activities—knocking on doors—for an unknown period of time.
""The Democratic Party stands united and fully committed to defeating the most dangerous president in modern history, and we welcome the announcement of Mayor Bloomberg's extraordinary investment to ensure that happens,"" Kate Bedingfield, a spokeswoman for Mr. Biden's campaign, said in a statement.
Hawkfish LLC, Mr. Bloomberg's digital startup, will continue its operations.
Mr. Bloomberg's campaign told staff in the six battleground states where he had committed to continuing operations that they would be paid through the first week in April and have full benefits through the end of April. They will now have to reapply for positions through the DNC's program, according to the Democratic official.
Mr. Bloomberg's campaign staffers—many of whom believed, based on the candidate's public comments and private conversations with the campaign, that they were guaranteed jobs through November—were informed in a call Friday morning about the billionaire's decision not to form a new super PAC and keep them on payroll. Many were surprised by the news and concerned about finding new jobs in a market roiled by the coronavirus pandemic.
""There has been no sensitivity,"" said one of the staffers on the call. ""It's been all about beating Trump and not about the people who worked"" for Mr. Bloomberg.
The Bloomberg campaign aide said they have provided names of their staff to the DNC with the hope that they will use the new funding to hire them.
The former New York City mayor's contribution to the DNC will be the largest transfer from a presidential campaign in recent history. Following the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign made a transfer of $3.8 million in cash and in-kind contributions, the DNC said.
""With this transfer from the Bloomberg campaign, Mayor Bloomberg and his team are making good on their commitment to beating Donald Trump,"" Mr. Perez said in a statement. ""This will help us invest in more organizers across the country to elect the next president and help Democrats win up and down the ballot.""

COLUMBIA, S.C.—In good times and bad, Joe Biden has taken refuge in South Carolina, often joking that when he dies, he hopes to be reborn in Charleston.
So when his struggling presidential campaign needed a lift, he turned to the state for a lifeline Saturday, notching a burst of momentum and a chance to become the alternative to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the race for the Democratic nomination.
""I told you all that you could launch a candidacy. You launched Bill Clinton, Barack Obama to the presidency. Now you've launched our campaign on the path to defeating Donald Trump. This campaign is taking off,"" Mr. Biden said, pumping his fists.

Mr. Biden's blowout victory over Mr. Sanders
in South Carolina's primary, his first-ever win during three presidential campaigns, could offer the former vice president a springboard into several Southern states holding contests on Super Tuesday's 14-state bonanza of delegates.
Mr. Biden, who served alongside President Obama for eight years, has repeatedly pointed to his support among African-Americans as he seeks the nomination. Exit polls in South Carolina, where African-Americans made up more than half of the primary electorate, showed him receiving well over half of black voters, far ahead of Mr. Sanders.
With only three days until Super Tuesday, Mr. Biden is now banking on black voters—and momentum from South Carolina—to propel him forward in states such as North Carolina, where he held a rally earlier Saturday, and Virginia, where he will campaign Sunday with Sen. Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton's running mate in 2016. Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who considered a presidential bid, announced his endorsement of Mr. Biden as the South Carolina results trickled in and plans to join Mr. Biden and Mr. Kaine on Sunday.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What do you see as Joe Biden's next steps after South Carolina? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Biden also plans to travel to Alabama, Texas and California in the coming days, seeking to consolidate support among moderate Democrats who fear a Sanders nomination will hurt the party up-and-down the ballot against President Trump.
Yet after spending much of last year as the leading contender in national polls, Mr. Biden faces a daunting challenge against Mr. Sanders and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire who has blanketed Super Tuesday states with more than $160 million in advertising.
Mr. Biden's poor performances
in Iowa
and New Hampshire forced him to campaign extensively in Nevada, where he placed second, and in South Carolina.
The footprint of his campaign's organization in Tuesday's contests is much smaller than that of Mr. Sanders, who aims to build a large delegate lead with victories in California and several states on Tuesday.
Mr. Bloomberg, meanwhile, has assiduously courted black voters in states such as North Carolina, Arkansas, Tennessee and Alabama, putting pressure on Mr. Biden. In a sign of his sway, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign was holding more than 2,400 events in 30 states during the weekend to boost voter turnout.
Mr. Biden has also struggled to keep pace with his rivals in fundraising, ending January with about $7 million in the bank, limiting his ability to advertise extensively.
His campaign is devoting about $2.2 million in ads across eight states ahead of Tuesday's vote, a fraction of Mr. Bloomberg's spending. Ahead of Mr. Biden's victory, Unite the Country, a pro-Biden super PAC, placed a $1.2 million ad buy in six Super Tuesday states, according to Federal Election Commission filings.
Mr. Biden told reporters Saturday outside a polling location in Greenville, S.C., that he had been raising about $1 million a day ""for the last week or so,"" and hoped South Carolina's outcome would improve his standing.
""The bigger the win, the bigger the bump,"" he said.
During the final week before South Carolina's primary, Mr. Biden frequently cited Mr. Sanders's support for a Medicare-for-all health care system, which he said would undermine the Obamacare law.
The tougher critique of Mr. Sanders—along with criticism of Mr. Bloomberg—is likely to serve as a template for Mr. Biden's push into the March contests.
""Look, this nation isn't looking for a revolution,"" Mr. Biden said Friday in Sumter, S.C. ""They're looking for progress. They're looking for results.""
During his final days in the state, Mr. Sanders lengthened his criticism of Mr. Biden's record as senator, saying he didn't think the former vice president could beat Mr. Trump when voters learned more about his past.
""Joe Biden is a good friend of mine. I've known Joe for many years, he's a decent guy, but I don't believe that Joe can beat Trump when people learn that he voted for the war in Iraq,"" Mr. Sanders said in Spartanburg on Thursday.
Mr. Biden has long engaged in a personal brand of politics, and his carefully cultivated relationships in South Carolina served as an asset before the primary.
His supporters said those connections mattered in a state that has often displayed a contrarian streak in presidential politics.
""It wasn't done in three or four days. It was done over 30 years,"" said Fran Person, a former personal aide to Mr. Biden who lives in South Carolina.
During more than four decades in public office, he made repeated trips to South Carolina, building relationships with black churches and faith-based communities, which play an outsize role in state politics. He worked closely with state officials on local projects such as the dredging of Charleston's port.
When his 46-year-old son, Beau Biden, died of brain cancer in 2015, Mr. Biden's extended family mourned together on Kiawah Island, where the Bidens frequently vacation.
Residents here recalled that Mr. Biden interrupted that trip to privately meet with parishioners of Mother Emanuel A.M.E. church in Charleston after the shooting deaths of nine people during Bible study. The church massacre happened in the weeks after Beau Biden's death.
""Joe Biden, who was suffering his own loss at that time, gave comfort to those families who had lost loved ones,"" said Fletcher Smith Jr., a former state representative from Greenville.
In his speech Saturday night, as Mr. Biden recalled how he and his family sought comfort from the congregation, his wife, Jill, and daughter, Ashley, grew emotional, wiping away tears.
""We needed to heal, too,"" Mr. Biden said in a nod to the church. ""We left here having arrived in overwhelming pain thinking, 'We can do this. We'll get through this.'""
Mr. Biden's connection to the state was on raw display last week, when he won the coveted endorsement of Rep. James Clyburn, the highest-ranking black lawmaker in Congress who is considered a kingmaker in South Carolina politics. Exit polls showed the endorsement of Mr. Clyburn was significant to nearly half of the electorate.
Mr. Biden bowed his head and grew emotional as the congressman announced his decision, which he said was made in part because his wife, Emily Clyburn, who died last September, had been so fond of Mr. Biden.
""I know Joe,"" Mr. Clyburn said. ""We know Joe. But most importantly, Joe knows us.""

DES MOINES, Iowa -- After a day of confusion and recriminations over a technical mishap that snarled the vote count, the first wave of delayed results from Iowa's presidential caucuses showed Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders at the top of the Democratic pack.
The early numbers, representing nearly three-quarters of precincts, suggested a possible split verdict that could have one candidate winning the popular vote and another securing the most delegates, the measure state and national party officials have said should determine the victor.
A close finish between Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, also would underscore the larger Democratic primary battle between progressives and more moderate candidates in a field still totaling close to a dozen.
More broadly, the muddled results and fallout from the chaotic count stoked tensions among the candidates and concerns among party officials that the process is doing little to find a strong nominee who can unite the party.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, a longtime front-runner who has built his campaign on the idea that he is that candidate, appeared headed for a worse-than-expected finish. He is competing with Mr. Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota among the more moderate candidates, and the Iowa results suggest he was beaten by Mr. Buttigieg who was barely known a year ago and who has never governed anything larger than a city of about 100,000 people.
The moderate contenders also face a growing challenge from billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who wasn't on the ballot but who has risen in polls after spending several hundred million dollars on advertising. Mr. Bloomberg said on Tuesday that he would further step up spending and hiring.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, representing the more liberal wing of the party, was below Mr. Buttigieg in the early results but above Mr. Biden.
Ms. Klobuchar, who frequently says on the campaign trail that she has never lost an election since fourth grade, appeared headed for a fifth-place finish in Iowa.
Though the state's population is small and not very diverse, Iowa's caucuses have had a reasonably good record in recent history of picking the eventual winner of the Democratic nomination: Al Gore in 2000, John Kerry in 2004, Barack Obama in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016.
The caucuses have been less predictive among Republicans in recent election cycles.
There are indications the Democratic Party is unlikely to resolve its debate over candidates and vision anytime soon. All four of the top candidates heading into the caucuses had campaign war chests large enough to sustain them through February, including the New Hampshire primary next week.
A self-described democratic socialist, Mr. Sanders has recently shown strength in national polls. That has triggered concerns among centrist Democrats who worry President Trump, a Republican, would use Mr. Sanders's political identity to damage the party's prospects in November.
The release of the results followed a brief news conference Tuesday afternoon with Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price, who said the nearly one-day delay for even partial results was unacceptable and happened because of ""multiple reporting challenges"" as about 1,700 precincts began to feed results into state party headquarters.
Mr. Price declined to say when all of the state's results would be made public. ""We're going to take the time we need,"" he said.
The state party is collecting paper records completed during the precinct meetings. It has attributed the holdup to a software glitch that triggered inconsistencies in data obtained from a mobile app used to report vote tallies.
""We know this data is accurate,"" Mr. Price said. ""We also have a paper trail.""
With 71% of precincts reporting, Mr. Buttigieg had the largest share of delegates to the state party convention, while Mr. Sanders had the second most. But Mr. Sanders led in the raw vote so far, followed by Mr. Buttigieg.
Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden were third and fourth respectively in both counts.
Mr. Buttigieg, a 38-year-old openly gay man who is the youngest in the race, could see a bump following what appears to be the best showing of any moderate in the race. He has positioned himself as a voice for generational change -- most of his top opponents are septuagenarians -- who is willing to work across the political aisle.
In New Hampshire, Mr. Buttigieg has also recorded strong support in polls, but he faces a stiffer challenge in the more ethnically diverse states of Nevada and South Carolina this month, as he has so far received virtually no support in polls from black and Latino voters.
The muddled reporting gave all the top candidates room to frame the result as a win.
Speaking to reporters Tuesday evening in New Hampshire after the release of some Iowa results, Mr. Buttigieg was asked what it would mean to his candidacy if he ends up finishing in second or third place. ""It still amounts to an astonishing victory for our vision,"" he said.
In a statement, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders called the early numbers gratifying. ""In the partial data released so far, it's clear that in the first and second round more people voted for Bernie than any other candidate in the field,"" Jeff Weaver said.
Ms. Warren said at her first New Hampshire event on Tuesday, ""We know that three of us will be dividing up most of the delegates coming out of Iowa. I'm feeling good.""
Mr. Biden during an appearance in Nashua, N.H., expressed optimism after arriving from Iowa. ""It's like my mother said, 'Hope springs eternal,'"" Mr. Biden said. ""We're not giving up.""
State party officials in Nevada, where the second caucus of the nominating season will be held, on Feb. 22, pledged that they wouldn't experience the same failures as Iowa.
""We will not be employing the same app or vendor used in the Iowa caucus,"" Nevada State Democratic Party Chair William McCurdy said in a statement. ""We had already developed a series of backups and redundant reporting systems, and are currently evaluating the best path forward.""
Meanwhile, Mr. Trump pounced on the uncertainty, calling the Democratic caucuses an ""unmitigated disaster"" in a Tuesday morning tweet, ahead of his State of the Union address scheduled for that evening.
The reporting was complicated in this year's caucuses by additional data.
In response to calls for greater transparency following the close 2016 contest between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton, the state party was to release for the first time the raw total for votes from both rounds of voting, along with the traditional share of delegates won.
Mr. Sanders has been ahead of his rivals in recent state polls in New Hampshire but Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg have been within striking distance.
New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley said it is ""highly unusual to have at this point so many competitive campaigns. Usually we are down to three at the most.""

WASHINGTON—The House delivered two articles of impeachment against President Trump to the Senate on Wednesday, after voting to
approve seven Democratic managers
to prosecute the case before the Republican-controlled chamber.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that she stressed litigation experience in choosing managers to handle the trial over alleged presidential abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Senators are expected to be sworn in on Thursday, and the proceedings are scheduled to get under way in earnest on Tuesday.
""The emphasis is making the strongest possible case to protect and defend our Constitution, to seek the truth for the American people,"" Mrs. Pelosi (D., Calif.) said.
""President Trump has done nothing wrong,"" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said, adding that he ""expects to be fully exonerated.""
The managers aim to advance Democrats' arguments that Mr. Trump should be removed from office. The group comprises House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of California, Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Reps. Zoe Lofgren of California, Val Demings of Florida, Sylvia Garcia of Texas and Jason Crow of Colorado.
After a brief debate, the House approved the managers, 228 to 193, almost entirely along party lines. One Democrat, Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota, broke with the party and voted against the resolution. He had also opposed both articles of impeachment. Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, an independent who left the GOP last year, supported the resolution.
The Democratic-led House
voted to impeach Mr. Trump
last month. The first article of impeachment stems from Mr. Trump
pressing Ukraine to investigate
former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, including by
withholding almost $400 million in aid
to help Kyiv combat Russian aggression. The second article accuses Mr. Trump of impeding Congress's investigation by preventing witnesses from testifying and defying subpoenas for documentary evidence.
After the House impeached Mr. Trump, Mrs. Pelosi held off on naming the managers for nearly a month, as Democrats unsuccessfully sought guarantees from Senate Republicans that new witnesses would be heard and new evidence presented. She relented this week, after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) ratcheted up the pressure on her by signing on to a resolution to dismiss the case.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What's your assessment of the managers picked to oversee the impeachment trial? Join the conversation below.
House Democratic leaders argue the delay paid off, as new emails and documents related to the case emerged in recent weeks, as well as documents showing the effort to undermine the then-U.S. ambassador to the country.
""It made sense to wait a while, as even more evidence piled up, but we have to proceed, because…the integrity of the election is at stake,"" said Mr. Nadler, referring to the November presidential election.
The White House doesn't believe there is a need to hear witness testimony in the Senate trial, a senior administration official said. The official said the White House considers it ""extraordinarily unlikely"" that the trial would last longer than two weeks.
But several Republican senators, including Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, have said they would be open to hearing from new witnesses, and Mr. McConnell has ruled out a quick dismissal of the case.
Witnesses sought by Democrats
include former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who were directed by the White House not to testify before the House inquiry.
Votes on witnesses and documents could extend the trial beyond the two-week time frame, potentially extending it through the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3—the first nominating contest in the 2020 Democratic presidential race—and Mr. Trump's State of the Union address, scheduled for Feb. 4.
""If people decide they want to call witnesses, it probably could go on for a while,"" Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.), the No. 2 Senate Republican, said on Tuesday. He said that wrapping up the trial by Mr. Trump's State of the Union address ""seems like a fairly tight deadline given what we are facing.""

Republican senators briefed on a GOP draft of rules for the trial said it likely will include
a guaranteed vote on witnesses
and documents after opening arguments and a period for written questions. Moderate Republicans had been pushing for such a vote, putting them at odds with Mr. Trump, who recently renewed his call to dismiss the articles without a trial.
Some GOP senators are pushing reciprocity of witnesses, so that if Democrats hear from Mr. Bolton, Republicans would push to hear from Mr. Biden's son, Hunter Biden, according to a person familiar with the matter. The younger Mr. Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company that Mr. Trump asked Ukraine's leader to investigate—one of the acts at the center of the House's impeachment case.
""If [Democrats] end up getting witnesses, I'm going to insist there be a motion that the president gets to call anybody deemed to be necessary to his defense,"" said Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) in an interview.
Both Bidens have denied any wrongdoing, and in the Democratic debate Tuesday night, Joe Biden called allegations from Mr. Trump and his allies ""flat-out lies.""
Mrs. Pelosi signed the articles of impeachment in a ceremony at the Capitol on Wednesday. Flanked by the leaders of several House committees and the impeachment managers, she again laid out the case for impeaching Mr. Trump, accusing him of abusing his oath of office and obstructing Congress. She then sat to formally sign the articles of impeachment, cycling through about a dozen pens emblazoned with her name as she did so, and finally handing one of the pens to each of the lawmakers gathered. She kept one for herself.
The House's clerk and the sergeant at arms, accompanied by all seven Democratic impeachment managers, then walked the articles to the Senate, along with a message that the House has appointed managers to exhibit the articles of impeachment.
In the Senate chamber, the camera flashes first came into view through the filigreed windows of the Senate door. At 5:34 p.m., the procession of seven House Democrats appeared at the door, met by Laura Dove, secretary for the Republicans, who signaled the group to head to the back wall.
The managers entered, single file, and walked to their places. At their desks inside the chamber, 27 Senate Democrats sat in their seats. Mr. McConnell and Sen. Kevin Cramer (R., N.D.) were in the room to bear witness.
""Mr. President, a message from the House of Representatives,"" Ms. Dove told Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), the Senate's president pro tempore, who presided over the chamber.
Mr. McConnell acknowledged the message and said the Senate will receive the managers to present the articles of impeachment at noon Thursday.
""This is a difficult time for our country, but this is precisely the kind of time for which the framers created the Senate,"" he said.
On Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts, who will preside over the trial, is to be sworn in by Mr. Grassley. Mr. Roberts is then expected to administer the same oath, to do ""impartial justice,"" to all 100 senators, who will act as the jury. At least two-thirds of the senators would have to vote to convict Mr. Trump to remove him from office.
Mr. Trump will be summoned and given time to respond. Then the Senate is expected to break for the holiday weekend before reconvening to start the trial.
Proposed restrictions on press access during the trial have become a point of contention, with fewer ways for reporters to speak to senators and increased security within the Senate Press Gallery.

WASHINGTON—The top U.S. intelligence official for election security warned that adversaries seeking to interfere in the 2020 elections have become ""more sophisticated"" as states prepare to hold the voting season's first primaries and caucuses next month.
Shelby Pierson, the principal adviser on election threats in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said Tuesday that actors intent on spreading malign influence have become more numerous and potent since Russia's breaches in the 2016 election. She included Iran, China and North Korea, as well as Russia and hackers unaffiliated with governments, on the threat list.
""The threats as we go into 2020 are frankly more sophisticated,"" said Mrs. Pierson in a speech at a conference for election administrators. ""They have sharpened their own capabilities,"" she said about foreign adversaries without elaborating.
U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russian government directed hacking and social media campaigns to disrupt the presidential election in 2016. Concerns about Russian interference rose anew this week after a cybersecurity firm reported that Russian hackers had
targeted a Ukrainian gas company caught up in the impeachment inquiry
into President Trump.
Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday that she was alarmed by the report that hackers connected to Russia's military intelligence recently breached Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian energy firm where a son of Joe Biden, the former vice president and a Democratic candidate for president, once served on the board.
Mrs. Pelosi told reporters at the Capitol that House Democrats discussed the alleged hacking during a closed-door caucus meeting. A House Intelligence Committee official also said the panel has asked the intelligence community for more information.
Mrs. Pierson declined to comment on Burisma when asked by reporters.
In her remarks at the conference, she described 2016 as a watershed for the intelligence community, which, she said, has since marshaled its expertise on cybersecurity and foreign adversaries to counter the threat.
""This is not a Russia-only problem,"" Mrs. Pierson said. ""Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, nonstate hacktivists all have opportunity, means and potentially motive to come after the United States in the 2020 election to accomplish their goals.""
Voting systems in the U.S. are run by state and local governments across the country, posing a challenge to protecting them from breaches. Among recent security improvements are the use of more secure voting machines, testing by third-party experts and training sessions with national security agencies.
Election officials at the conference on Tuesday said that they are better prepared to ward off cyber threats, but also that they expect adversaries to try to find new ways to interfere.
""We better all be on our toes,"" said Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos in remarks to the conference. ""They're coming at us this year.""

LACONIA, N.H.—Democratic presidential candidates arrived in New Hampshire with busy campaign schedules but locked in a race denied any clear sense of direction by
the caucus problems
in Iowa.
As the Iowa Democratic Party began releasing results late Tuesday, people in line for a Pete Buttigieg town hall in central New Hampshire were live-streaming cable news on their phones. One man yelled, ""We won,"" as the initial tallies showed the former South Bend, Ind., mayor in the lead.
At Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's morning event in Keene, voters predicted the confusion from Monday night in Iowa would focus even more attention on the nation's first voting primary.
""Everyone's eyes are here now,"" said Christine Hansen, a 64-year-old retired physical-therapy assistant.
Mr. Buttigieg had told supporters as he arrived in the state early Tuesday that he was optimistic about his results in Iowa—and his chances in New Hampshire. Four-term Nashua, N.H., Mayor Jim Donchess endorsed Mr. Buttigieg on Tuesday morning, saying mayors ""get results.""
The initial results from Iowa showed Mr. Buttigieg in a close race for first place with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.). Mr. Sanders was scheduled to hold a rally Tuesday night in Milford, N.H., shortly before President Trump was to deliver his State of the Union address in Washington.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, in comments in Nashua, said his campaign officials ""don't know precisely"" how many delegates he earned in Iowa, but he said he felt good about getting ""more than our fair share.""
""Now it's time for New Hampshire to speak and speak loudly,"" he said.
New Hampshire Democratic officials said their election night would be far smoother next Tuesday; voters cast secret ballots rather than engaging in the complex process used by Iowa.
Results for the Iowa race weren't released on Monday as expected, with the Iowa Democratic Party attributing the problem to inconsistencies in data reported through t
he election app
used to report vote tallies. The party began putting out tallies around 5 p.m. Eastern time, reporting 62% of its total, with promises of additional updates.
Just as in Iowa, polls in New Hampshire aren't foreshadowing a runaway winner. Rather, four candidates—Messrs. Biden, Sanders, Buttigieg and Ms. Warren—have been well ahead of the other candidates in recent state polls, and often within single digits of each other.
Mr. Sanders led at 24%, topping Mr. Biden by six percentage points in a Boston Globe/WBZ-TV/Suffolk University poll of likely New Hampshire Democratic voters released late Monday. Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg polled in the low double-digits in that survey, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.
Complicating the forecast in the state, almost half of New Hampshire residents registered to vote identify not as Democrats or Republicans, but as undeclared, according to statistics kept by the secretary of state. Both undeclared and Democratic registrants can vote in the primary, making it difficult to predict which voters will turn out and which candidate will prevail.
At political events across the state on Monday, residents said they were eager to see what Iowans had decided and would look to the Friday debate in New Hampshire for guidance.
""I have my favorites, but it depends on the day,"" said Kelly Zeilman, a sophomore at Dartmouth College in Hanover, before listing what she viewed as positive attributes of six of the 11 candidates still in the race, as well as one whom she said she still liked even though he had dropped out months ago.
Others said the New Hampshire voting would be more straightforward than Iowa's caucuses.
""You don't get an individual vote, it's all by consensus, which doesn't seem prudent in 2020,"" said Nancy Bonell, a 62-year-old retired YMCA official attending Ms. Warren's Tuesday event. She said she found the Iowa process daunting.
Share Your Thoughts
How might the delay of Iowa caucus results affect the New Hampshire primary? Join the conversation below.
The state's populous liberal enclaves, such as Concord and Manchester, helped push Mr. Sanders, from neighboring Vermont, to a 22-point victory over Hillary Clinton four years ago. That win turbocharged his fundraising and momentum, ensuring a long primary.
Joshua Adjutant, a Sanders supporter and a young state representative from Grafton, N.H., praised Mr. Sanders for moving the Democratic Party to the left on issues like health care. ""The longer he's in sight, the more people like him,"" Mr. Adjutant said.
In polls, Mr. Sanders has mostly held a narrow lead over rivals, though sometimes they have topped him. He replaced his top strategist and campaign manager in the state in September.
Mr. Buttigieg has made an aggressive play for voters in areas that have leaned more independent or Republican, including Wolfeboro, where 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney has a summer home.
Sue Prentiss, the former mayor of Lebanon and a Republican until Mr. Trump's election, said voters like her have been looking at both Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Biden. She backs Mr. Buttigieg, but said she understood why ""people consider Joe Biden a safe space.""
""The question everyone is asking is, 'Who has what it takes to beat Donald Trump?' "" she said.
Ms. Warren has a robust network of volunteers who have been pitching her for more than a year. Her campaign also advocated for candidates in local races to build Democratic relationships. Ms. Warren is from neighboring Massachusetts, but she hasn't advertised in the pricey Boston television market, which bleeds into New Hampshire, since her 2012 Senate race. She only began advertising here in mid-January.
The candidates and political groups involved in the race have bombarded the state with about $40 million in TV and radio ads, with more likely to come in this final week, according to ad tracker Kantar/CMAG. Billionaire self-funded candidate Tom Steyer accounts for half of that spending, but he hasn't been registering in polls.
Mr. Sanders has spent about $6 million on ads, far more than Ms. Warren's $1.5 million. Mr. Buttigieg has spent about $3.3 million on ads.
Neither Mr. Biden nor the super PAC backing him have put significant money into TV or radio here. Mr. Biden and his supporters have instead poured resources into other early primary states, such as South Carolina, where his commanding support from African-American voters has given him an edge.
Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet both largely sidestepped Iowa and are betting on New Hampshire voters to lift their longshot campaigns out of obscurity. A super PAC backing Mr. Patrick, called Reason to Believe, has put almost $2 million into a New Hampshire TV and radio ad plan, Kantar/CMAG shows.
At a campaign event Monday afternoon in Hanover, Mr. Patrick faced a pointed question from Gail Murray, of Canaan, N.H., who said she found his November entry into an already crowded primary puzzling. ""What the heck?"" she asked.
""Have you decided, by the way?"" Mr. Patrick shot back.
""I have not,"" she admitted.
""I'm not too late for you,"" he said.

WASHINGTON—House Democrats and President Trump's defense team concluded their closing arguments to the Senate, the last major step in the
impeachment trial
before an expected acquittal this week on
charges
of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
The two sides gave their final pitches Monday to the jury of 100 senators who had largely made up their minds on impeachment, broadly unmoved by three weeks of presentations and arguments. They used their final two hours apiece to issue warnings: Democrats focused on what they saw as the danger to democracy presented by Mr. Trump remaining in office, while the Trump legal team decried what it called the use of impeachment as a political weapon.
The vote on the two articles of impeachment will be on Wednesday. The first article stems from
Mr. Trump pressing Ukraine
to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a top Democratic presidential candidate, which Democrats allege amounted to attempted interference in the 2020 election. The second article accuses Mr. Trump of obstructing Congress's investigation by preventing witnesses from testifying and defying subpoenas for documentary evidence.

How Republicans Scotched the Idea of Witnesses in Impeachment Trial

In the trial proceedings Monday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the lead impeachment manager, again urged senators to convict Mr. Trump. Mr. Schiff warned of a ""runaway presidency"" and argued that Mr. Trump's removal was needed now, rather than waiting for the 2020 election to decide his fate.
""He has betrayed our national security and he will do so again,"" Mr. Schiff said. ""He has compromised our elections and he will do so again. You will not change him.…Now do impartial justice and convict him.""
Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing and again called impeachment a hoax on Twitter on Monday. His legal team, in their presentation, painted the Democrats' pursuit of impeachment as purely political, driven by a longstanding dislike of the president.
""At the end of the day, this is an effort to overturn the results of one election and to try to interfere in the coming election that begins today in Iowa,"" said White House counsel Pat Cipollone.
Iowa's caucuses
Monday evening kick off the Democratic and Republican nominating contests.
""What the House Democrats have done to this nation, to the Constitution, to the office of the president, to the president himself and to this body is outrageous,"" said another Trump team lawyer, Jay Sekulow.
Mr. Trump and his allies have argued that Mr. Trump's interest in Mr. Biden was legitimate, alleging it was corrupt for Mr. Biden during the Obama administration to seek the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had once investigated a Ukrainian gas company where Mr. Biden's son Hunter sat on the board. Mr. Biden sought the prosecutor's removal as part of a broad international effort to combat corruption in Ukraine. The Bidens have denied wrongdoing. Hunter Biden has said it was poor judgment on his part to serve on the Burisma board while his father was involved with Ukraine policy as vice president.
An acquittal for Mr. Trump is all but certain, following the
Senate's vote
last week to not seek new witnesses or documents and as Republicans defended the president's actions. Twenty Republicans would have to join the entire Democratic caucus to vote to remove the president. No Republicans have said they favor impeachment, and just two supported the Democrats' effort last week to seek more evidence in the trial, which failed 51-49.
What isn't clear is whether the acquittal vote will be bipartisan. Some Democratic senators, such as Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Doug Jones of Alabama and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, are undecided. Mr. Jones, representing a state that backed President Trump by 28 points in the 2016 election, is
the most vulnerable Democratic senator
this cycle.
The president is scheduled to give his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, in the chamber where the House approved two articles of impeachment against him in December. Some Republicans hoped that the president would move forward past impeachment in the annual speech.
""There are a lot of really great things he should talk about, and stay away from maybe what the proceedings are,"" said Sen. Joni Ernst (R., Iowa). ""Let's focus on the things that can bring us together. What does he want to see coming up next? We've got infrastructure we need to be working on. I think we really need something that will pull Democrats and Republicans back together again.""
But Sen. Angus King (I., Maine), who caucuses with the Democrats, said he expects Mr. Trump to be emboldened as he heads into the State of the Union address, and beyond.
""He's expressed no remorse or understanding that he did anything wrong, so why should he hold back? That's what worries me,"" Mr. King said.
A new
Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll
published on Sunday found a majority of voters said they believed Mr. Trump abused his power by asking Ukraine to investigate a potential political opponent in order to influence the coming election, and that Mr. Trump obstructed Congress by not cooperating with the impeachment inquiry.
But there wasn't majority support for removing him from office. The poll found 49% said he should be allowed to finish his term, compared with 46% who said he should be removed. Mr. Trump's job approval in the January poll stood at 46%, with 51% disapproving, in line with results throughout the Trump presidency.

New York officials are debating whether to move the state's Democratic presidential primary from April 28 to a date in June as the number of coronavirus infections grows.
State Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat from Orange County, introduced a bill that would move the nominating contest to June 23, which is already the date of primary elections for members of Congress as well as the state Assembly and Senate.
State health officials project the outbreak will reach its peak in around 45 days. Mr. Skoufis said he was concerned about the possibility of the virus spreading at polling places and said consolidating elections would save taxpayer money
""Joe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee, so there's no responsible reason why we should continue on with an April primary,"" said Mr. Skoufis, who had endorsed Pete Buttigieg's candidacy.
The April 28 elections were shaping up to be Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders's last stand against the former vice president. Mr. Biden
has amassed 1,181 delegates
, compared with Mr. Sanders's 885.
Good-government advocacy groups including Citizens Union and Common Cause NY also support the postponement.
Republicans canceled their presidential primary after President Trump was the only candidate who submitted the required nominating signatures. Douglas Kellner, a Democratic commissioner of the State Board of Elections, said moving the presidential primary would be up to the state Legislature and Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Mr.. Kellner supports the idea.
""I think that the date is arbitrary and the risks to the public outweigh the relative importance of keeping our democratic functions operational,"" he said.
Mr. Cuomo said Sunday that he was exploring ways to make it easier for people to vote by mail in the primary. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio last week
postponed a March 24 special election
for Queens borough president because of the outbreak. Spokesmen for Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, both Democrats, didn't respond to a request for comment.
April 28 had become the so-called ""Acela Primary"" because voting was also scheduled in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland and Rhode Island—all of which are serviced by Amtrak's express train. The governors of Maryland and Connecticut already delayed their contests until June 2, and officials in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island are also considering changes.
New York State Democratic Chairman Jay Jacobs said he believes it is premature to reschedule the primary. Mr. Jacobs said voting on June 28 would cause logistical problems: It will take officials around 10 days to certify the results, and the party's state committee must hold a meeting to name at-large delegates before the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, which starts on July 13.
""At the moment, I choose to be optimistic and look at reports that show it might be abating by the date of our primary,"" Mr. Jacobs said of the coronavirus outbreak.
The Democratic National Committee has rules in place that penalize the amount of convention delegates awarded to a state if it holds a primary after June 9. Mr. Jacobs said he was confident the DNC would reconsider its regulations in light of the outbreak; a DNC spokeswoman didn't respond to an email seeking comment.
There are also special elections on April 28 for a congressional seat in western New York, a state Senate seat around Syracuse and three Assembly seats. Political strategists said the virus has already prompted campaigns to focus their efforts online as door-to-door canvassing has been curtailed to prevent the spread of the virus.
""As people are self-quarantined more and more and more—the reality is, if you're sitting at home for three weeks, in some ways you're a captive audience,"" said Doug Forand, a senior partner in Red Horse Strategies, a political consulting firm.
THE QUESTION: Which New York governors have mountains named after them in the Adirondack Park?
—Know the answer? Leave a comment!
THE LAST ANSWER: Former New York Gov. George Pataki gave a posthumous pardon to comedian Lenny Bruce in 2003.

Voting to convict President Trump on an abuse-of-power charge may not be the last thing Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) does to defy his party on the Ukraine saga that has consumed Washington since last year.
Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.), the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, plans to hold a vote next week on issuing a subpoena in the panel's probe of Hunter Biden's service on the board of a Ukranian energy company.
The panel is reviewing unsubstantiated allegations that former Vice President Joe Biden, a top Democratic candidate for president, assisted his son while he led international anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine.
President Trump's push for Ukraine to investigate those allegations led to his impeachment in the House last year. Several witnesses in the impeachment inquiry said they knew of no evidence that Joe Biden acted improperly, though Hunter Biden has said that serving on the company's board showed poor judgment.
Mr. Romney, a member of the Homeland Security committee, was the only Republican to join Democrats in the Senate to vote to convict Mr. Trump on the first of two articles of impeachment and he is indicating that he may now slow his colleagues' investigation into Joe Biden. If Mr. Romney joins every Democrat on the panel to vote against the subpoena, it would fail.
""I would prefer that investigations are done by an independent, nonpolitical body,"" Mr. Romney said, cautioning against a highly politicized investigation. He added that he would ""take a look and see, that's something I'm considering"" when asked about the subpoena vote.
""There's no question the appearance is not good,"" Mr. Romney said of the investigation.
Mr. Johnson has argued that his probe is not geared toward damaging Joe Biden, who has surged to become the front-runner in the Democratic primary in just the last week. Democrats have said that the current Senate probe, as well as Mr. Trump's original push, was aimed at hurting Joe Biden's prospects in the election.

COLUMBIA, S.C.—Joe Biden's strength with black Democrats is being tested here as losses in Iowa and New Hampshire have led some voters to give his rivals a second look.
""I've been listening to Pete Buttigieg,"" said William Mack, 25 years old, who was getting a haircut Friday in a predominantly black barbershop wearing a smock bearing the image of former President Obama. Mr. Mack said his parents' support for Mr. Biden had led him to think that he, too, would cast a ballot for the former vice president when this state hosts its Feb. 29 primary.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How important do you think winning over black Democrats is to Joe Biden's candidacy? Join the conversation below.
But Mr. Mack said he started to give Mr. Buttigieg a look after hearing that the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., had outperformed Mr. Biden in New Hampshire's primary. ""I just feel like he's a young and energetic person,"" Mr. Mack, of Blythewood, said of Mr. Buttigieg.
To be sure, Mr. Biden remains the 2020 presidential candidate
with the most support among black Americans
, an important factor in a state in which more than 60% of Democratic voters are black. Many of Mr. Biden's rivals, including Mr. Buttigieg, have struggled to gain widespread traction here. The Biden campaign insists that its underperformance in the early contests won't undermine the support among black voters, particularly older ones, who consistently say in interviews that they appreciate Mr. Biden for his time in the White House as Mr. Obama's No. 2.
Yet there are signs Mr. Biden's black support could erode enough to make this state competitive.
Trav Robertson, the state Democratic Party chairman, has been working in South Carolina politics for 20 years and said the race is the most fluid he has seen. ""This race is wide open here,"" Mr. Robertson said. ""Joe Biden has some work to do in order to close the deal and win South Carolina.""
A dearth of public polling in the Palmetto State makes it hard to assess how the electorate is leaning. However, one survey released immediately after Mr. Biden's fourth-place finish in Iowa's caucuses and fifth-place tally in New Hampshire suggests that his position with black Democrats in South Carolina is weakening.
East Carolina University's survey conducted in the days before the Iowa caucuses
showed Mr. Biden leading the field among black South Carolina likely voters
, with 44% support. ECU conducted another poll after the New Hampshire primary,
in which Mr. Biden's black support fell 8 percentage points
to 36%. During that same time frame, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders saw his support double—from 10% before Iowa to 20% after New Hampshire.
Billionaire Tom Steyer was in third place among black likely voters, with 17%. No other candidate was in the double digits with black South Carolinians.
Among all likely South Carolina Democratic voters, the gap between Messrs. Biden and Sanders was closer in the post-New Hampshire poll: 28% for the former vice president compared with 20% for Mr. Sanders.
Mr. Biden has long bet that black Democrats would be the linchpin of his candidacy. Showing that he wanted to shore up support, Mr. Biden left New Hampshire on its election day for South Carolina, the first state in the Democratic primary contest in which the party's powerful black voting bloc gets its say. The Biden campaign has long considered this state a firewall against losses in the states that vote earlier.
Nevada's caucuses are Feb. 22, followed by South Carolina's primary a week later. Then, the candidates dash to a series of bigger and more diverse states that vote on
Super Tuesday
, which is March 3. By the end of March, a majority of delegates to the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee will have been awarded.
Todd Shaw, associate professor of political science and African-American studies at the University of South Carolina, said that Mr. Biden's strength among the most loyal Democratic voting bloc—older black voters—had been shaken by his weak showings in Iowa and New Hampshire.
""There would be less uncertainty if Biden's camp wasn't going through the doldrums that it is,"" he said. ""Safe money would still say that Biden is most likely, but I don't know how quickly his support is evaporating.""
Jim Hodges, the last Democrat to serve as governor in the state, endorsed Mr. Biden just before the Iowa caucuses after deciding that he was the candidate best able to win in November.
""Despite Biden's stumbles, those stumbles occurred in some states that aren't particularly representative of the country,"" Mr. Hodges said. Mr. Biden is the favorite in South Carolina, Mr. Hodges said, but he also warned that a bad loss in Nevada this week ""would have some impact, if there are three substantial losses in a row.""
Mr. Sanders, who
won the Feb. 11 contest in New Hampshire
and appeared to lead the popular vote in Iowa's still-disputed Feb. 3 caucuses, is gaining ground against Mr. Biden in South Carolina, thanks to solidifying support from younger voters—including minorities.
Abdul Qaddafi, 28, works in logistics in Charleston and is leaning toward voting for Mr. Sanders. ""He's been trying so hard, and I like a guy who makes a lot of effort.""
Mr. Biden, as well as Mr. Steyer, have rolled out Obama-centric ads in South Carolina that didn't air on TV in Iowa or New Hampshire, according to political ad tracker Kantar/CMAG. Mr. Steyer has an ad called ""Hope"" that features Greenwood County, S.C., council member Edith Childs, who was the inspiration for Mr. Obama's slogan, ""Fired Up, Ready to Go.""
""Tom's fired up and Trump's got to go,"" Ms. Childs says in the ad.
Some Democratic voters said they had received a dozen or more mailers from Mr. Steyer and
had seen his campaign ads on social media and TV for months
. Mr. Steyer has been a longtime investor in black-owned banks in the state and has hired influential black legislators as his advisers. He is seen as a potential spoiler in the race, drawing moderate voters who might otherwise back Mr. Biden.
""I see him on TV,"" Jessie Roberts, a 57-year-old laundry worker at a hotel in Columbia, said of Mr. Steyer. He said he felt like Mr. Steyer was ""for the people.""
""The way he talks, he's a good candidate,"" Mr. Roberts said.

DES MOINES, Iowa—An election debacle unfolded Monday night as the Iowa Democratic Party failed to release the results of the
state's presidential caucuses
, saying it had found ""inconsistencies in the reporting"" as the nation awaited the outcome of the first-in-the-nation nominating contest.
""In addition to the tech systems being used to tabulate results, we are also using photos of results and a paper trail to validate that all results match and ensure that we have confidence and accuracy in the numbers we report,"" Mandy McClure, the state party's communications director, said in a statement.
She said
a mobile app
used to record and report results from each caucus site ""did not go down and this is not a hack or an intrusion. The underlying data and paper trail is sound and will simply take time to further report the results.""
The delay has temporarily deprived the winner of the burst of media attention and momentum that typically comes from success in Iowa. It also may have given any candidates who performed poorly a free pass.
During an early Tuesday conference call with the campaigns, state party officials said they weren't willing to provide details on any results they had collected, according to a person familiar with the call. The officials said they expected to release results later Tuesday but didn't specify a time, the person said.
The campaign of former Vice President Joe Biden said in a letter to the state party that ""acute failures are occurring statewide"" in the party's reporting system. ""We believe that the campaigns deserve full explanations and relevant information regarding the methods of quality control you are employing, and an opportunity to respond, before any official results are released,"" wrote Dana Remus, general counsel for Mr. Biden's campaign.

Richard Harpootlian, a former South Carolina Democratic chairman who volunteered for Mr. Biden's campaign in a suburban Des Moines precinct, called the caucuses ""the most convoluted, distorting process I've ever been involved with.""
""We all entered stuff on an app. So where's the results? They're just dragging it out,"" Mr. Harpootlian said.
President Trump pounced on the uncertainty, calling the Democratic caucuses an ""unmitigated disaster"" in a
Tuesday morning tweet
. ""Nothing works, just like they ran the Country,"" he wrote, adding that only he can claim victory in the state. The president is
scheduled to deliver
his annual State of the Union address Tuesday night.
With the results still unknown, several campaigns released internal, unverifiable data from the caucuses to claim a favorable result. The candidates also took to stages scattered around Iowa's capital to declare their own versions of success.
""I imagine, have a strong feeling, that at some point, the results will be announced,"" said Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. ""And when those results are announced, I have a good feeling we're going to be doing very, very well here in Iowa.""
Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar told her supporters gathered at a caucus night party that they are ""punching above their weight.""
""Even in a crowded field of candidates, even during the well-earned impeachment hearing of Donald J. Trump, which had me bolted to my Senate desk for the last two weeks, we kept fighting,"" Ms. Klobuchar told her supporters. ""And you kept fighting for me.""

The caucuses kicked off the party's
quest to find a challenger to President Trump
in November's election, formally opening a primary campaign that showed no signs of wrapping up quickly.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called the race ""too close to call"" during her speech, but said she was confident the final Iowa results would show her in a strong position.
Ms. Warren once again signaled that her campaign is gearing up for a long nomination fight. ""This fight will stretch across all 57 states and territories that make up this great nation until we unite together as a party in Milwaukee,"" she said, referring to the host city of the party's convention this summer.
Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., took the stage and claimed victory, even as he acknowledged the official results were unknown.
""By all indications, we are going on to New Hampshire victorious,"" he told his supporters. ""We don't know all the results, but we do know when it's all said and done, Iowa, you have shocked the nation.""

The reporting was complicated in this year's caucuses by additional data. For the first time—in response to calls for greater transparency—the state party was to release the raw total for votes from both rounds of voting, along with the traditional share of delegates won.
The data had to be transmitted from nearly 1,700 neighborhood caucuses, typically held in school gymnasiums and public libraries. Dozens of additional ""satellite caucuses"" were held for those unable to attend a meeting in their own neighborhood.

)
Some precinct chairs struggled to transmit caucus results, according to people familiar with the situation, both via a mobile app and by a backup telephone system.
Two caucus organizers said before the gatherings started that they had heard about issues with downloading or logging into the app, meaning they would likely need to call in their results over a secure phone line that had been set up as a backup plan.
The state party said before the caucuses that the reported issues had come mainly from areas with poor cellphone service or have involved minor user errors.
After the caucuses began, Adin Mann, a caucus official in Story County, said in an interview that the app ""wasn't working at all.""
An Iowa campaign operative said the state party said on a conference call with the presidential campaigns that 35% of precincts were able to successfully report their results. But when campaign officials asked for additional details, including if the state party might provide a statement offering clarity, the call ended abruptly.
Democrats have been debating whether to back someone promising major change and a bigger governmental role in the economy, such as Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren, or a more moderate candidate who might win over independents and some Republicans. Messrs. Biden and Buttigieg fall into that camp.
There are indications the party is unlikely to resolve this debate soon. All four of the top candidates heading into the caucuses had campaign war chests large enough to sustain them through February, including New Hampshire's primary on Feb. 11.
Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, has recently shown strength in national polls. That has triggered concerns among centrist Democrats who worry Mr. Trump would use Mr. Sanders's political identity to damage the party's prospects in Midwestern battleground states that helped decide the 2016 election.
If Mr. Sanders shows strength in the first few state contests over more moderate candidates like Messrs. Biden and Buttigieg, it would almost certainly add fuel to the candidacy of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire, is skipping any serious competition for the first four states holding nominating contests, a strategy no successful candidate has pursued in the modern era. He is instead focusing his fortune on states with primaries and caucuses in March, a month when about 60% of the delegates to the national convention are in play. And he has already spent lavishly, devoting more than $300 million to the campaign.
His prospects in the Democratic nominating race likely rest on whether Mr. Biden is doing well or struggling to compete after the first several contests, as well as whether another moderate like Mr. Buttigieg or Ms. Klobuchar—who focused on competing in Iowa this year—has moved into contention by the end of February.
The massive size of the Democratic field—still at close to a dozen—has complicated the party's hopes of coalescing around a nominee more quickly than in 2016. Some supporters of Mrs. Clinton, the eventual nominee, have said she was harmed by an extended fight for the nomination with Mr. Sanders.
A victory in Iowa would offer a significant achievement to Mr. Sanders, who overcame a heart attack during the fall and has separated himself from Ms. Warren, the party's other leading liberal in the race, in recent months.

What Happens at the Iowa Caucuses

Mr. Biden, meanwhile, has campaigned on his experience, his ties to former President Obama and his contention that he would give the party its best chance of defeating Mr. Trump in a series of hard-fought battleground states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Mr. Biden's birth state of Pennsylvania.
Ms. Warren struggled during the fall to explain how she would implement—and pay for—a Medicare-for-all health plan and has watched her poll numbers dip as Mr. Sanders has improved his standing with liberals and Mr. Buttigieg has picked up support among suburban voters.
Mr. Buttigieg, a military veteran who is openly gay, entered the race as a relatively unknown mayor of a midsize city but has raised his profile through an extensive media campaign and focus on early voting states. To gain traction, however, he would need to gain interest among African-American voters in states such as South Carolina, where he has limited support.
The future of Ms. Klobuchar's candidacy could be more dependent on the Iowa outcome than the others because of her deep investment in the state and status as a neighbor.
When Democrats settle on their nominee, they will enter a general-election contest against a man who has been preparing for the fight since he took office more than three years ago. Mr. Trump is likely to be the best-funded president seeking re-election in history and will have a sophisticated digital messaging and get-out-the-vote operation at his disposal.

WASHINGTON—House Democrats cited witnesses and documents the White House kept from impeachment investigators to press their case that President Trump has obstructed Congress, seeking to win over enough Republican senators to subpoena additional materials.
Friday marked the last chance for the seven Democratic managers—House lawmakers acting as prosecutors—to make their opening pitch to GOP senators who may be wavering on whether to subpoena witnesses and documents. Democrats say the material could bolster the allegation that Mr. Trump improperly
withheld nearly $400 million in aid
to Ukraine as leverage for the country to open investigations into Vice President Joe Biden, a potential election opponent this year, then tried to cover it up.
Mr. Trump ""invited foreign interference in our elections and sold out our country's security for his personal benefit, and betrayed the nation's trust to a foreign power,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) said.
Later, in his closing remarks in a tense Senate chamber, Mr. Schiff read out each allegation against Mr. Trump, then added, ""The facts have been proved. Those facts are not contested. We have met our burden."" He concluded shortly before 9 p.m. with an appeal to senators: ""I ask you, I implore you, give America a fair trial.""
Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing. He derided the Democrats' presentation Friday, saying in an interview with Fox News: ""They've been telling so many lies, so many fabrications, so much exaggeration. And this is not impeachable.""
The president's legal team will kick off its three days of arguments on Saturday morning, when it plans to speak for two to three hours, a person on the team said. The White House wanted to begin rebutting Democrats on Saturday but plans to save the bulk of its arguments for Monday and Tuesday, when there will be more television viewers, a person familiar with the discussions said.
Rep. Jason Crow (D., Colo.) led off the Democratic arguments Friday, wrapping up managers' presentation of the
first article of impeachment
, alleging abuse of power. Mr. Crow ran through the chronology surrounding the frozen Ukraine aid, which was later released amid media reports and a bipartisan outcry in Congress. The hold on the aid ""was only lifted because President Trump had gotten caught,"" he said.
Managers spent the bulk of Friday, however, on the second article of impeachment, which accuses Mr. Trump of trying to thwart the House inquiry by directing witnesses not to testify, refusing to allow the release of documents and ordering executive-branch agencies to do the same.
""We are here today in response to a blanket order issued by President Trump directing the entire executive branch to withhold all documents and testimony from that inquiry,"" said Rep. Val Demings (D., Fla.). ""President Trump's obstruction of the impeachment inquiry was categorical, indiscriminate, and historically unprecedented.""
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do you think Democrats will be able to sway enough Republican senators to break ranks and agree to subpoena witnesses and documents? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Schiff said the second impeachment article, alleging obstruction, was just as important as the first article, alleging abuse of power.
If lawmakers ""lack the power to investigate a president, there will never be an article one, whether that article one is abuse of power, or that article one is treason, or that article one is bribery,"" he said. ""If you can't have the ability to enforce an impeachment power, you might as well not put it in the Constitution.""
Democrats said House committees issued 71 categories of document requests or subpoenas last year to the White House, the Office of the Vice President, the Office of Management and Budget and the State, Defense and Energy departments. The White House blocked all of the requests.
Senate Democrats have said they want to subpoena a slice of those documents, including emails from National Security Council officials who expressed concern about Mr. Trump's decision to delay aid to Ukraine, and about a July 10 meeting in which the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, urged Ukrainian officials to announce investigations as a way to get an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart.
Senate Democrats also want to hear from at least four witnesses, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton. In total, 12 current or former Trump administration officials declined to testify as part of the House impeachment inquiry.
It would take a simple majority of 51 senators to vote for the additional evidence, meaning that at least four Republicans would have to vote with all 47 senators in the Democratic caucus. If Democrats can't muster those four GOP votes, the trial could end as soon as next week.
Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee are among those who have said they would be open to witnesses. They have been tight-lipped in recent days about how the Democrats' opening arguments might have affected their thinking.
Mr. Alexander told reporters he would make his decision after the questioning portion of the trial, expected next week. Mr. Romney said he would like to hear testimony from Mr. Bolton and that he would make a decision about other officials later. Mr. Bolton, who was described by witnesses as alarmed at the pressure put on Ukraine,
said earlier this month that he would testify
in a Senate trial if subpoenaed.
White House officials have said they don't expect any Republicans to vote in favor of hearing from more witnesses, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) is privately far less certain, people familiar with the talks said.
The White House has largely delegated the task of rallying senators to vote against witness testimony to Mr. McConnell and a handful of other senators, though some White House officials including the president have been in contact with lawmakers as the trial has unfolded.
During the trial, Mr. McConnell is using daily closed-door lunches as a venue for GOP senators to have frank exchanges and relay feedback to party leadership.
Among the arguments some Republicans are making at lunch and in private conversations is that voting in favor of witness testimony would further prolong the trial with an extended court battle over executive privilege, people familiar with the talks said. Republicans also say that witness testimony won't change the case and that the trial should end by the Feb. 4 State of the Union address.
Mr. McConnell has made that case publicly, saying on the Senate floor Tuesday that pursuing new witnesses could indefinitely delay the Senate trial and draw the body into a protracted and complex legal fight. ""Such litigation could potentially have permanent repercussions for the separation of powers and the institution of the presidency that senators would need to consider very carefully,"" he said.

Analysis: Trump Impeachment Trial

Mr. Schiff told reporters on Friday that it is ""nonsense"" that subpoenaing new witnesses or documents could make the trial last too long. ""This is not a trial over a speeding ticket or shopping ticket, this is an impeachment trial involving the president of the United States,"" Mr. Schiff said. ""These witnesses have important firsthand testimony to offer.""
Trump attorney Jay Sekulow has rejected Democrats' push for more documents and witnesses, citing executive privilege, the principle presidents use to protect communications with close aides and advisers from public scrutiny. The argument is that confidentiality is needed to protect national security and to enable the president to receive frank and honest advice.
Executive privilege isn't explicitly mentioned in the Constitution but is understood to be implied by its separation of powers. Democrats say executive privilege shouldn't be used to shield a president engaged in alleged misconduct.
Sixty-six percent of Americans say the Senate should call witnesses to testify in Mr. Trump's impeachment trial, including 45% of Republicans, 65% of independents and 87% of Democrats, according to an
ABC News/Washington Post poll
released on Friday.
Previewing the White House's opening arguments, Mr. Sekulow said Friday that his team would include discussion of Mr. Biden, as well as his son Hunter, who worked at Ukrainian firm Burisma. Mr. Trump and his allies have accused Joe Biden of working to replace the Ukraine prosecutor to protect his son, but Joe Biden pressed for his removal with the backing of U.S. allies at a time when the prosecutor's probe into Burisma was dormant. Both Bidens have denied wrongdoing.

The presidential election is 10 months away,
but Michael Bloomberg's long-shot campaign
is running like it's already late October.
The candidate has spent $217 million so far on television and digital advertising, mostly ignoring the Democratic primaries and squarely challenging President Trump. The total is roughly three-quarters of the amount spent by all other campaigns, including Mr. Trump's, combined.
It's the game plan the billionaire used in his campaign for mayor of New York City in 2001, when he outspent his competitor nearly 5 to 1. Big spending has also made his philanthropy
a dominant force on climate change, gun control and other issues
. And it is how he has managed his lucrative business, paying up to bring in talent.
The flow of cash—dubbed the Bloomberg effect by media-measurement firm Advertising Analytics LLC—has upended the financial dynamics of the election. Television ad rates jumped 45% in Houston after the Bloomberg campaign bought $1 million worth of ads in November, Advertising Analytics said. The
campaign paid as much as double the going rate for staff and promised jobs to workers through November
, whether or not Mr. Bloomberg stays in the race. The candidate, who is funding his run entirely by himself, now has 1,000 campaign staffers.
It's a big part of the reason roughly $20 billion is expected to be spent on political advertising this election cycle, dwarfing the previous record of $12 billion in 2016, according to media research firm, Borrell Associates.
""Everything about what Bloomberg is doing is unprecedented,"" said Rufus Gifford, former finance director for Barack Obama's presidential campaign. Mr. Bloomberg remains a long shot, Mr. Gifford said, ""but when you have Donald Trump as president and one of the 10 richest people running for president, anything can happen.""
Kevin Sheekey, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign manager, said there's more to
Mr. Bloomberg's candidacy
than his spending, pointing to wealthy but politically inexperienced candidates such as Meg Whitman or Ross Perot who failed in the past. ""Money won't just determine elections,"" he said. ""You have to have a record and a message.""
Lots of rich people have run for office, lots of candidates have claimed excellent business credentials and many have claimed to have top-flight data operations, which Mr. Bloomberg emphasizes. What sets his campaign apart is his $55 billion checkbook.
Mr. Bloomberg is No. 9 on the Forbes list of the world's richest people, ahead of each of the Google founders, either Koch brother and the wealthiest members of the Walton family. A person familiar with the plans said he could spend $500 million on the primaries alone, and Mr. Bloomberg hasn't ruled out spending $1 billion before November if needed.
""Certainly it's going to be disruptive,"" said Robert Wolf, former chairman and CEO of UBS Americas and a longtime Democratic donor. ""We just don't know how yet.""
Mr. Bloomberg, who was mayor of New York from 2002 to 2013, is currently supported by 6% of voters, compared with 27% for former Vice President Joe Biden in the Real Clear Politics average of polls. More voters have a negative than a positive view of Mr. Bloomberg, according to a Quinnipiac University National Poll from mid-December.
Mr. Bloomberg said he entered the race at a moment when polling data suggested voters placed less importance on ideology and more on finding a candidate who could beat Mr. Trump. His campaign believed Mr. Trump was winning the race and was going unchallenged in political ads in competitive states as Democratic candidates focused on the primary battle.
At the time, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was surging. Polls showed Mr. Biden beating Mr. Trump but within the margin of error. Ms. Warren's policies, such as a wealth tax, would likely hurt Mr. Bloomberg, and she is generally disliked by his circle of wealthy New Yorkers, according to a longtime staff member. Mr. Bloomberg has said he will back whoever wins the nomination, even if it is Ms. Warren or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
To offset criticism that he was running out of his own self interest, Mr. Bloomberg pledged $15 million to $20 million to register 500,000 voters before the election. His attacks on Mr. Trump are part of that effort.
""There's a sense that Bloomberg is doing something that the party can't do—going negative on Trump,"" Mr. Gifford said. ""It's work that the party doesn't have the money to do, and other candidates don't have the ability to do.""
After Mr.
Trump's campaign said it had bought a 60-second TV spot during the Super Bowl on Feb. 2
, the Bloomberg campaign bought a 60-second spot that will target the president. The Bloomberg campaign declined to disclose how much it was spending for the spot, but advertising tracker Kantar/CMAG estimates it is worth $10 million.
Bloomberg spending has drawn Mr. Trump's attention. When the campaign aired an ad saying the president had broken his promise of protecting those with pre-existing health conditions, Mr. Trump pushed back on Twitter and labeled Mr. Bloomberg ""Mini Mike.""
Mr. Bloomberg's campaign said that because he started late, it is focusing on the Super Tuesday votes on March 3, rather than the early voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire. The plan plays to Mr. Bloomberg's financial advantage and minimizes his weaknesses—shaking hands and making small talk with voters, and giving stump speeches. The
Super Tuesday states
, where 40% of delegates will be chosen, instead depend more on television and digital advertising.
In addition to huge TV spending—$193 million on ads since his campaign began—the campaign has spent heavily online. It spent $16.1 million on Google ads as of Jan. 11 and $6.8 million on Facebook as of the end of December according to Kantar/CMAG.
Mr. Trump has spent $6.5 million on digital ads, and Tom Steyer, the other billionaire Democratic candidate, has spent $5.6 million since Mr. Bloomberg entered the race in November, as of the end of last year.
The Bloomberg campaign is offering field organizers salaries of $6,000 a month. For state data directors, it's between $10,000 and $12,000 a month, according to job postings.
The campaign's 1,000-person payroll is more typical of an operation in the final months before Election Day. Mr. Biden has roughly 400 campaign staffers, while Mr. Sanders has built an 800-person staff.
The former mayor's late entry into the race has forced the campaign to ""create a sense of momentum and hope people will actually jump on,"" said a person familiar with Mr. Bloomberg's state operations.
Campaign veterans said money won't necessarily bring in the best staff and said many experienced staffers want to work for people they support. Other campaigns, including Ms. Warren's and Mr. Sanders's, already have operations in Super Tuesday states and are ramping up hiring in later states.
Mr. Bloomberg has spent in markets that haven't been targeted by other Democrats. His campaign has plunked down $21.2 million on television advertising in Texas, where none of the leading Democrats have spent a penny. It has spent $8.4 million in Pennsylvania, which doesn't hold its primary until April 28.
It has even poured resources into smaller states that are typically not on the primary radar. In Idaho, it has spent $979,000 so far; in Utah, $1.6 million.
""He is going far, far ahead of where the rest of the guys are scrumming,"" said Kip Cassino, executive vice president at Borrell Associates, the media research firm. ""He is basically saying, 'I'm not going to win in Iowa, and I am not going to get out there and kiss pigs. And I won't win in New Hampshire, but I will win in the rest of the states, and I will get the states that most everyone didn't care about before.' ""
At the beginning of January, candidates had spent close to $540 million on political ads in the presidential race over the prior 12 months, about 10 times what would have been expected at this point in this election cycle, Mr. Cassino said.
""We have never seen anything like this,"" Mr. Cassino said, referring to Mr. Bloomberg's spending. ""We are only just starting to see how distorting this might be.""
Mr. Bloomberg's potential handicaps among Democratic voters include his support for Republican candidates in the past, including former President George W. Bush. Other issues that could hurt are his support for charter schools in his education-reform efforts, and the stop-and-frisk policy he adopted as mayor, in which New York police had wide latitude to detain and search passersby for contraband. A federal judge eventually ruled the policy violated the constitutional rights of minorities. Mr. Bloomberg apologized for the stop-and-frisk policy before he kicked off his campaign.
Share Your Thoughts
What are Michael Bloomberg's chances at the Democratic nomination, as of today? Why? Join the discussion below.
Some Democrats fear Mr. Bloomberg could drag out the primary with his limitless budget, or use his money to try to influence the leading candidates, hoping to pull some of them to the political center, which he sees as the way to beat Mr. Trump.
Mr. Bloomberg's team said the data operation he is building will benefit Democrats overall, which he said are far behind the Republicans on the gathering and use of voter data. His data firm, Hawkfish LLC, launched in the spring. It has hired Facebook's former chief marketing officer and the former CEO of Foursquare, the location tracking firm.
Mr. Bloomberg has cited his research and spending on the 2018 midterm elections as evidence of his commitment to the party's success. Democratic candidates won 21 of the 24 races in which he was involved. In most races, the spending focused on digital advertising early in the election cycle and TV advertising closer to election day, when ad reservations were more expensive and Republican groups could not as easily counter their message.
In an Oklahoma House of Representatives race, which appeared to be a long-shot for the Democrats, Mr. Bloomberg unleashed a wave of last-minute ads that attacked the Republican candidate. Democrat Kendra Horn won by a few thousand votes.
""I supported 24 candidates who were good on guns and good on environment, and 21 of them won, and that flipped the House,"" he said at a recent campaign stop in Philadelphia. ""So if it wasn't for that, you wouldn't have [Speaker of the House Nancy] Pelosi and you wouldn't have impeachment.""

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's pragmatic, can-do appeal to a diverse electorate helped propel her to the governor's mansion. Some Democrats including Joe Biden, whom Ms. Whitmer recently endorsed, hope the same formula can help them win back the state in the presidential election.
Ms. Whitmer and a host of freshman Democratic U.S. House members from across the state won over moderates in areas around Detroit in 2018 that had been Republican strongholds. At the same time, Ms. Whitmer benefited from increased turnout in Wayne County, home to Detroit, a predominantly black city that is also the state's largest.
That is a reversal from 2016, when President Trump won the state on strong support in white rural areas while Hillary Clinton couldn't match Barack Obama's turnout in majority-black areas. If Mr. Biden wins Michigan's primary Tuesday it will help demonstrate her influence in a crucial general election state, where Ms. Whitmer is already trying to quash chatter she is a contender for the vice president spot on the Democratic ticket.
""By the time we get to November, turnout's going to be high,"" Ms. Whitmer said in an interview, calling the low Democratic turnout in 2016 ""an anomaly."" ""We carried the biggest counties that people look to as deciding the Trump election in 2016, and so we are, I think, poised to have a big turnout,"" she said.
Jessica Taylor, who analyzes governor races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said swing-state Democrats should replicate Ms. Whitmer's appeal to broad kitchen-table issues such as infrastructure.
""She ran with 'fix the damn roads,'"" Ms. Taylor said.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What role do you see Ms. Whitmer playing in the 2020 election? Join the conversation below.
Ms. Whitmer and her lieutenant governor, Garlin Gilchrist II, recently endorsed Mr. Biden for president ahead of the state's primary on Tuesday. Mr. Gilchrist predicted Mr. Biden would be able to win Michigan in a general election because he has thus far in the primary appealed to the political coalition that he and Ms. Whitmer assembled in 2018. In recent primaries, Mr. Biden has won states where black voters make up a significant chunk of the electorate. Exit polls and vote results suggest he has brought former Republican suburbanites into the Democratic primary.
""Black Democrats are inspired by people who show up,"" said Mr. Gilchrist, the first black American to attain his office. ""As a black Democrat who lives in Detroit, I think it's important that [people] know that the person who we're supporting, Vice President Joe Biden, is stepping up.""
Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a freshman lawmaker who ousted a Republican incumbent in a district that includes a swath of Detroit suburbia, said that Ms. Whitmer's election displayed a formula for victory in Michigan: Unite swing voters with a party's core base of support.
""That's how Barack Obama won here, that's how Bill Clinton won here, I think that's how Gov. Whitmer won,"" Ms. Slotkin said. ""It's not one or the other, and I think there's a false between saying you can only focus on base Democratic voters or swing voters. The job is to approach both.""
Indeed, national Democrats have taken note of how Ms. Whitmer and Mr. Gilchrist ran in 2018.
""Michigan is a critical battleground and we are following the roadmap that successful Democrats made in 2018, like Gov. Whitmer, to compete everywhere, invest early and talk about issues that are essential to voters' lives"" like the cost of prescription drugs, said DNC spokesman David Bergstein.
However, just as the national political landscape is a tough environment for bipartisanship, Ms. Whitmer has seen her fair share of quarrels with Republicans in her state.
The Republican-controlled statehouse rejected her proposed gasoline tax, which she would have used to pay for road work, leaving her ""fix the damn roads"" promise largely unfulfilled. The Republicans said the proposal amounted to typical Democratic politics. ""Whether it's a ridiculous 45 cent gas tax increase or massive debt spending, Gretchen Whitmer has proven that she is just another tax and spend Democrat like Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders,"" said RNC spokesperson Michael Joyce.
Ms. Whitmer has instead relied on executive actions, which she has acknowledged are less sweeping than reforms possible with lawmakers.
She is also no stranger to controversy. One of the most high-profile flashpoints from her first year in office came when black leaders pushed back against her plan to close a predominantly black high school in Benton Harbor, a small town in the state's southwest corner along Lake Michigan.
Ms. Slotkin, the congresswoman, said that national Democrats should embrace Midwestern politicians like Ms. Whitmer, if not least for the sake of broadening the party's appeal beyond urban enclaves—especially on the coasts.
""I'm keenly aware that lots of political leaders from both parties tend to be from the coasts or from places that are deep red or deep blue,"" Ms. Slotkin said, calling any politician from a swing state an asset to the Democratic ticket.
Democratic operatives say buzz about Ms. Whitmer's future in the party is bound to grow—especially if Mr. Biden becomes the party's nominee. Ms. Whitmer has played down speculation she has sights on higher office.
""I am not angling to leave the state of Michigan. I've been governor for 14 months, I've got a lot of work to do,"" she said.

DES MOINES, Iowa -- In Iowa days before the state's kickoff caucuses, President Trump pumped up a megarally while Vice President Mike Pence ordered a deluxe burger.
Showcasing their commitment to a key early-voting and general-election state, the president and vice president both traveled to Iowa on Thursday and illustrated their contrasting campaign styles in the process.
The president landed in the state on Air Force One that night. He addressed thousands of supporters packed into an arena at Drake University, declaring, ""We are going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats.""
His vice president arrived earlier for a daylong bus tour that included the kind of traditional political pit stops that his boss rarely makes: chatting with voters at fast-food joints and diners. He stopped by a Culver's -- a Midwestern staple known for its ""ButterBurgers"" and frozen custard -- where he greeted a pastor and a mother with her little girl and ordered a Culver's deluxe with bacon. Later, he posed for pictures at Des Moines' Drake Diner.
With Mr. Trump's impeachment trial gripping Washington, both the president and vice president were seeking to redirect attention to the 2020 race and energize state Republicans days before Monday's caucuses.
The visits reflect their campaign's effort to boost turnout and test its muscle in an important general-election state.
Speaking in Des Moines, Mr. Trump touted his new trade deal with Canada and Mexico, as well as the ""phase one"" trade agreement with China, framing the deals as important to Iowa's agricultural community.
""I have a place in my heart for the farmers,"" he said.
The president said congressional Democrats are ""obsessed with a deranged witch hunt hoax,"" again referring to the impeachment proceedings as ""impeachment light."" And he criticized several Democratic presidential hopefuls, including Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joe Biden.
""Joe had a crowd that was so small the other day that they set up a roundtable,"" Mr. Trump said.
Mr. Pence crisscrossed Iowa on Thursday in a bus. During a speech before evangelical voters in Sioux City, the vice president sought to keep the focus on his boss, declaring: ""I just spoke to him on the bus, told him I was in Sioux City, Iowa, and I think he sounded just a little bit jealous.""
Connie Schmett, co-chair of the Republican Party of Polk County, Iowa, said Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence were a good pair.
""With President Trump, we have so many people that are so excited about this man because he is not the normal politician,"" she said. ""Vice President Pence is a little more mainstream. He's soft-spoken. He's a kind man. I think they complement each other.""
With no serious Republican challenger, the president is expected to win his party's caucuses easily. Still, more than 80 surrogates are scheduled to flood the state for the voting on Monday.

BENTONVILLE, Ark.—Kicking off a get-out-the-vote rally in the hometown of the country's largest retailer, Michael Bloomberg had praise for ""one of the most remarkable businesses in America.""
He wasn't talking about Walmart, but the local Three Dog Bakery, known for its canine cakes and gourmet dog pastries.
""You know, I've been to a lot of places, but I think this is the first time I've been around the corner from a bakery for dogs,"" he said.
""We have two Labradors at home—one is a Labrador, and one is a questionable Labrador,"" he added, drawing polite laughter from attendees.

Asian-American Voters to Play Big Role on Super Tuesday

The billionaire Americans have seen over and over in meticulously produced
television ads
is traveling around the country in the final sprint before
Super Tuesday
, but he's showing no interest in the glad-handing, baby-kissing charm of a retail politician. Mr. Bloomberg's humor is corny, often about a local business, sports team, or highway in need of repair. If he uses a joke that he repeats in speeches, he tells the crowd so.
Mr. Bloomberg portrays himself as a much-needed crisis manager—a mostly all-business style in speeches he reads off a teleprompter. He takes no questions from voters.
He has campaigned in 68 cities, but he often looks uncomfortable on stage, where he always stands at a lectern. After his events, Mr. Bloomberg typically spends about 10 minutes shaking hands and taking selfies that show him flashing only the faintest hint of a smile.
The former New York City mayor is aware he is not known for inspiring speeches or charisma, and he is fine with that.
""I'm not a blowhard,"" he said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, interrupting a question to point out that his lack of charm and oratory skills isn't new. ""People in New York would tell you that, but they sure would tell you they were glad I was there, I think that's fair.""
His style is a contrast to former Vice President Joe Biden, who is hoping his big win in South Carolina Saturday will help him keep Mr. Bloomberg from winning over moderate and black voters. Mr. Biden, affectionately called ""Uncle Joe"" by supporters and known for his empathy, spends a lot of time connecting with voters at his events. But Mr. Bloomberg is betting that voters don't want a charming candidate so much as ""a competent leader at the front,"" especially as the coronavirus reaches the United States.
His campaign has spent $1.5 million for three minutes of airtime on two networks Sunday to address the coronavirus. ""Each crisis is different, but they all require steady leadership,"" he is expected to say in the ads, according to a transcript.
Following a
disastrous first debate performance
and a mediocre second one, Mr. Bloomberg, who was mayor of the largest city in the country for 12 years, is now also stressing at his events that he's not a ""typical politician.""
""I don't make pie in the sky promises. We don't talk until the cows come home,"" he has said in recent speeches—which are full of dated clichés—adding the country is electing a commander-in-chief, not ""college debater-in-chief.""
Many supporters who showed up to his events said in interviews they know they are not going to get rousing speeches or a personal connection from Mr. Bloomberg.
""When I see him, I see business. I see, boom, here's the problem, here's the solution,"" said Kristopher Green, 41, a radio personality who attended an event for Mr. Bloomberg in Houston. ""Here it is, and let's get it done.""
Mr. Green said the billionaire needed more polish on his campaigning and debate skills, but he said the 2020 election was about more than that. ""I get people want warm and fuzzy, but I don't think that even matters anymore,"" he said. ""We just want somebody who can beat Donald Trump. We can get to the other stuff later.""
Others said it could be hard for him to reach voters who want more than a manager.
Patrice Chandler, 65, a retiree from Memphis who attended one of his events and voted early for Mr. Bloomberg, said she believed the billionaire could make small changes to expand his support.
""He needs to add a bit of a personal touch—maybe a little smile,"" she said. ""Referring to minorities, he doesn't need to use the word 'them' because that is a disconnect.""

Occasionally, Mr. Bloomberg will show a more personal side, but only for a few seconds. At a ""Women for Mike"" event in McLean, Va., he brought up his mother, Charlotte, who died in 2011. ""I used to call her just about every morning when I got to work until she passed away at 102 years old,"" he said. ""I can tell you my mother's voice is still on the answering machine at home.""
Other times he's brought up his family, however, have been clumsier.
When someone yelled, ""We love you, Mike,"" as he took the stage in Memphis, Mr. Bloomberg responded with a riff about his adult daughters.
""If I could just convince my daughters to love me, it'd be fine,"" he said. ""I don't know about anybody else but daughters are tough. I have two wonderful daughters.""
""They want to campaign for me, but they've got things to do. My girlfriend's out there around the country.""
""Anyways,"" he said, awkwardly turning back to his prepared speech.

Joe Biden triumphed in the key state of Michigan, while also winning in Missouri, Mississippi and Idaho, as he built his delegate lead over Bernie Sanders with a coalition of African-Americans, suburbanites and older voters in Tuesday's round of Democratic presidential nominating contests.
Opening a new phase in the race, the former vice president put distance between himself and Mr. Sanders—and built upon his momentum from
wins in 10 Super Tuesday states
last week. Mr. Biden quickly sought to unite the party after prevailing in Michigan, which offered 125 delegates, the biggest prize of the night. The results in Washington, the second-biggest delegate haul of the day, were too close to call. North Dakota was also holding a contest.
""I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion,"" Mr. Biden said in remarks at Philadelphia's National Constitution Center. ""We share a common goal and, together, we'll defeat Donald Trump; we'll defeat him together.""
Mr. Biden has presented himself as the Democrat best able to challenge President Trump in general election battlegrounds such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, which was the first of those states to weigh in on the Democratic race. His win there, by one measure, is his most significant yet and could allow him to argue that he should be the party's nominee. With about 64% of precincts reporting, Mr. Biden had about 53% of the vote to about 38% for Mr. Sanders. The Vermont senator narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton in the state in the 2016 nominating contest.
Mr. Biden was projected the winner in Mississippi, Missouri and Michigan shortly after the states' polls closed, an early sign of his clout in three states with large African-American voting blocs. Black voters made up about two-thirds of the electorate in Mississippi, exit polls showed. Mr. Biden had won more than 80% of support in the state, with about 89% of precincts reporting.
The former vice president campaigned ahead of the Missouri primary among African-Americans in St. Louis and Kansas City. With about 93% of precincts reporting, Mr. Biden had about 60% of the vote in Missouri.
Mr. Sanders returned to his home in Burlington, Vt., and did not speak publicly after the election results. A campaign aide said he intended to participate in Sunday's debate in Phoenix.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a top Sanders surrogate, expressed disappointment as the election results streamed in. ""There's no sugar-coating it. Tonight's a tough night. Tonight's a tough night for the movement overall,"" Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said on Instagram.
Mr. Biden entered Tuesday with a delegate edge of 670 to 574 over Mr. Sanders, according to
a Wall Street Journal delegate tracker
, even as Super Tuesday states such as California and Colorado, which Mr. Sanders carried, continue to process election results.
Mr. Sanders sought to steady his campaign on Tuesday. Moderates in the Democratic Party rapidly
coalesced around Mr. Biden
after he won South Carolina's primary last month. Some in the party's establishment have expressed fears that Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who won the New Hampshire and Nevada contests, would be too liberal for many voters in the general election.
The campaigns competed for votes against the backdrop of
growing economic concerns
over
the spread of the coronavirus
. Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden both canceled rallies in Cleveland Tuesday, ahead of Ohio's primary next week, citing public health concerns. Both candidates have
questioned Mr. Trump's handling of the crisis
in recent days.
Exit polls coming in with the results showed Mr. Biden winning handily among black and older voters and performing well with those who had at least a college degree. Mr. Biden was also prevailing in cities such as St. Louis, Kansas City and Detroit and in their surrounding suburban areas—including Oakland County, Mich., a key general election battleground.
Mr. Sanders maintained a substantial advantage over Mr. Biden among young voters, exit polls showed. The Vermont senator staked much of his campaign on motivating the young, and others disenchanted with current politics, to come to the polls.
Mr. Biden, while campaigning in Michigan, spoke of the Obama administration's bailout of General Motors and Chrysler, two titans of the state's auto industry, more than a decade ago.
""We bet on you,"" Mr. Biden said during a visit to a Fiat Chrysler assembly plant in Detroit earlier Tuesday. ""If I end up being the president, you'll never have a better friend in the White House.""
During a Detroit rally on the eve of the primary, Mr. Biden was joined by California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, two former presidential rivals who recently endorsed Mr. Biden's candidacy. The pair—who have been discussed by some Democrats as potential running mates for Mr. Biden if he wins the nomination—sought to help him appeal to black voters in the state.
Mr. Sanders courted voters at a Dearborn Heights, Mich., polling place on Tuesday, repeating criticisms he has raised about Mr. Biden's record, including the former Delaware senator's past support for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Mr. Sanders told reporters that was ""obviously a very important state"" but that he thinks every state is important to try to win. Last week, his campaign dispatched top aides to Michigan, including some who oversaw his Iowa caucus efforts.
""When our record is compared to Biden's, when our vision is compared to Biden's, when we have that debate in Phoenix, I'm feeling pretty good,"" Mr. Sanders said, referring to Sunday's
primary debate in Arizona
.
Tuesday's nominating contest served as the first opportunity for voters to consider a one-on-one choice between Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii) was still seeking the nomination but has been unable to break out of single-digit polling.
Mr. Biden has largely sought to avoid confrontation with Mr. Sanders as he attempts to build support in the party.
The former vice president mostly has only mentioned his opponent to point out that he himself has driven up turnout in primaries so far, not Mr. Sanders. Mr. Biden has argued that he is bringing African-Americans and white blue-collar workers into his coalition.
""Sen. Sanders likes to say, 'We need a record turnout to beat Donald Trump.' He's absolutely right,"" Mr. Biden has told audiences in recent days, rattling off statistics from Super Tuesday showing a turnout boost in states such as Virginia, Texas and North Carolina.
""Guess who they voted for? They voted for us,"" Mr. Biden said.

In the course of one week, the 2020 presidential campaign has transformed into something new and unexpected: a general-election contest that will start late and unfold in a crisis atmosphere.
Normally, this would have been a week that marked a shift from primary season to general-election footing. Former Vice President Joe Biden swept
the three Democratic primaries held on Tuesday
, in Florida, Illinois and Arizona, all by double-digit margins. In doing so, he effectively ended the argument that his last competitor, Sen. Bernie Sanders, might catch him.
But a primary that wasn't held, in Ohio, told an equally big tale. Ohio canceled its primary out of fears citizens turning out to vote might simply spread the coronavirus. In so doing, Ohio didn't merely raise doubts about how and when remaining primaries will be conducted; it also demonstrated how heavily
the coronavirus cloud
now hangs over the presidential contest.
Although it's now clear the vote this fall will pit Mr. Biden against President Trump, the country's coronavirus defensive crouch effectively banishes both from the campaign trail. In a sense, both are all dressed up for a general-election campaign, but with no place to go.
Like so many things in American life now, that situation is unprecedented, and neither campaign has a playbook for dealing with it. One thing is clear: Mr. Trump's handling of the crisis will become a central, if not the central, issue of the contest.
Mr. Biden already was trying to portray himself as a candidate with a combination of experience, competence and compassion, and now, with the crisis in mind, figures to double down on all those themes. Outside Democratic groups, meantime, geared up to attack Mr. Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
Yet the week ended with some good news for Mr. Trump on the coronavirus front. Although he has been criticized for not responding more quickly, an ABC News/Ipsos poll found that over the last week the share of Americans who approve of his management of the crisis has shot up to 55% from 43%.
The delayed start to the general-election campaign ""suits both sides, really,"" said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. For Mr. Trump, the delay means ""he can be president"" and campaign from within the confines of the White House. And it is ""a godsend"" for Mr. Biden, who needs time to raise money, which is in short supply.

DES MOINES, Iowa—Voters across the political spectrum here expressed everything from frustration to relief at the likely acquittal of President Trump as his impeachment trial sputters to an end.
The one emotion in short supply was surprise.
""It's unthinkable from a legal perspective and a moral perspective to not have witnesses in a trial,"" said Jack Trout, an 18-year-old-student at Grinnell College who is supporting Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic caucuses.
But Mr. Trout said he expected such an outcome from the Republican-led Senate. ""I feel like the GOP has become very much party over country,"" he said.
Taking the opposite view, 77-year-old retiree Ken Brown from Carlisle, Iowa, called the process ""an absolute hoax on the Democratic side.""
""They have nothing to offer except 'Hate Trump,'"" said Mr. Brown, who added the outcome also didn't surprise him. ""They'll continue. They will not quit because they have nothing else.""
Iowans' views as they readied for the state's leadoff caucuses on Monday underscored the deep ideological divides that have become the political status quo and signaled that the contentious process could drive enthusiasm on both sides of the aisle in a presidential election year.

How do you feel President Trump's acquittal will sway voters in the general election? Join the conversation below.
Their reactions could also point to how the outcome will be received more broadly. The early-voting state is a key general election battleground, which Mr. Trump captured by nearly 10 percentage points in 2016 over Hillary Clinton—but which President Obama won in 2008 and 2012.
Mr. Trump has argued that he did nothing wrong, painting impeachment as a partisan ""witch hunt.""
""We're having probably the best years that we've ever had in the history of our country, and I just got impeached. Can you believe these people?"" the president told a rally in Iowa on Thursday.
Democrats chasing the presidential nomination sought to emphasize impeachment as they made their closing arguments before the caucuses, with Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., describing himself as exhausted by the process and former Vice President Joe Biden making it a central part of his pitch to voters.
The Senate impeachment trial effectively ended Friday, after
Republicans blocked Democrats' demands
to call new witnesses and documents in the trial, putting the president on track for an acquittal vote on Wednesday. The impeachment trial centered on the president's efforts to press Ukraine to launch investigations that could benefit him politically and whether he blocked a congressional inquiry.
It wasn't clear that the Senate trial had significantly shifted views in Iowa, but rather reinforced existing feelings.
Diane Kueker, a 61-year-old who operates a thrift store in Cresco, Iowa, called it a ""horrible waste of tax dollars,"" adding that Democrats ""have been after him since the day he got in."" 





Cresco, Iowa. PHOTO: Daniel Acker for The Wall Street Journal
Ms. Kueker, who says she leans Republican and voted for Mr. Trump, lives in Iowa's Howard County. It's the only one of the U.S.'s more than 3,000 counties that voted by more than 20 percentage points for Mr. Obama in 2012 and by more than 20 percentage points for Mr. Trump four years later.
Susan Ohnysty, 60, a Trump supporter from West Des Moines, echoed Ms. Kueker's views, saying impeachment had been a ""waste of time and taxpayer money."" She said she was always hopeful the process would end in acquittal because ""the House articles of impeachment were not meeting the standards of a high crime.""
Mr. Trump was accused of freezing $400 million in security aid to Ukraine until it opened investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, and then with obstructing Congress in its impeachment inquiry. Mr. Trump has denied tying the aid to investigations and has defended blocking aides from testifying to Congress.
Linda Robinson, 72, a retiree from Boone, Iowa, who plans to caucus for Democrat Andrew Yang, said she thought the impeachment trial had value by establishing a public record of Mr. Trump's actions, even though many of her Democratic friends considered it a waste of time.
She said she watched the House hearings but paid less attention once Republicans took charge of the proceedings in the Senate. She said she wasn't surprised by the speed or result of the Senate trial.
""It's all gone the way I guess we thought it would because no one has a backbone,"" she said.
Phil Peterson, 67, an Iowa City resident and retired finance executive at a local hospital, who is considering caucusing for Mr. Biden, said the ""chances were kind of slim and almost none"" that Senate Republicans would allow Mr. Trump to be removed from office, and he expected the outcome that now seems likely on Wednesday.
But he predicted House Democrats would continue to cause political headaches for Mr. Trump.
""I think while the impeachment part is over, some investigations, I presume, will continue and more will come out in the public,"" Mr. Peterson said.

The
impending impeachment trial
, the U.S. troop presence in the Middle East and whether a woman can win the White House were among the topics six Democratic presidential contenders
addressed during the last debate
before voters start selecting a nominee to face the president in November.
""Look at the men on this stage. Collectively, they have lost 10 elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they've been in are the women: Amy and me.""—Sen. Elizabeth Warren
Tension has been brewing between Sens. Warren and Sanders, who share much of the Democratic liberal base.

Ms. Warren said earlier this week
that Mr. Sanders told her during a private 2018 meeting that a woman couldn't win the presidency. Mr. Sanders has repeatedly denied that, including during the debate. Though Ms. Warren called Mr. Sanders ""a friend"" when asked about the event, she pointed out the records of the two women Democratic contenders compared with the four male candidates. After the debate ended Ms. Warren refused Mr. Sanders' handshake, leading to a terse exchange between the two on stage, though it was unclear what was said.
Why this matters: The recent disputes have further divided the two campaigns, but the candidates kept it mostly friendly during the debate. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have since pointed out that any infighting could ultimately help Mr. Trump. Still, there are concerns that if Mr. Sanders's campaign is too divisive, his supporters may not rally around any other potential nominee—and that could lead to a repeat of what happened in the 2016 election with Hillary Clinton.
""The American people are sick and tired of endless wars which have cost us trillions of dollars.""—Sen. Bernie Sanders
President Trump's decision to authorize an airstrike that
resulted in the death
of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani has reignited a debate over America's military footprint in the Middle East.
The candidates were near unanimous in arguing for a diminished U.S. military presence in the region. But they differed sharply on a timeline for withdrawing troops, with Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders suggesting the U.S. should pull out of the Middle East entirely.
""We should stop asking our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily,"" Ms. Warren said.
Former Vice President Joe Biden and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar disagreed, suggesting it was impossible to remove all troops from the Middle East. Former South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a veteran of the Afghanistan war, said he favored taking a more limited approach and called for further military action to be authorized by Congress.
Why this matters: Foreign policy has largely taken a back seat in the Democratic primary in favor of domestic priorities such as health care and the economy. But Mr. Trump's recent actions in Iran have forced Democrats to contend with circumstances under which the U.S. could be fighting another ground war.
Mr. Biden's opponents have zeroed in on his vote in favor of the Iraq war, which the former vice president now acknowledges was ""a mistake."" Mr. Sanders, who opposed the war, said it was ""the worst foreign policy blunder in modern American history."" So far, Mr. Biden's Iraq war vote hasn't proved as much a liability as it was for Hillary Clinton in 2008.
""I don't know that there's any trade agreement that [Mr. Sanders] would ever think it made any sense.""—Former Vice President Joe Biden
Mr. Trump is poised to sign a
preliminary trade deal with China
on Wednesday, paving the way for a temporary detente in the continuing trade war between the world's two largest economies. The Senate also is gearing up for a vote to ratify the revamped North American trade deal, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement,
which was passed by the House of Representatives last month
. All of the Democratic candidates onstage—with the exception of Mr. Sanders and billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer—said they supported the USMCA despite their broader reservations over Mr. Trump's handling of trade policy.
Why this matters: Democrats have grown increasingly critical of international trade agreements amid pressure from labor unions and environmental groups. But ongoing divisions within the party over how to revamp existing trade deals were laid bare on Tuesday, as candidates sparred over the impact on American workers.
Ms. Warren, in a split with her liberal rival Mr. Sanders, backed the USMCA as ""a modest improvement"" that will provide temporary relief to farmers she said were hurting as a result of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Citing environmental concerns, Mr. Sanders maintained his opposition to the deal, stating: ""The answer is we can do much better than a Trump-led trade deal.""
Mr. Biden vowed there would be no trade agreements signed in his administration ""without environmentalists and labor at the table,"" but warned against isolating the U.S. economy by refusing to forge trade partnerships with international allies. Mr. Buttigieg said much of the ""fear and frustration"" over U.S. trade policy stemmed from a sentiment among American workers, in regions such as the industrial Midwest, that they had been left behind by previous trade deals.
The issue of trade is especially salient in Iowa, the first state in the Democratic nominating contest, where the agricultural industry has been disrupted by Mr. Trump's trade war with China.
""We've asked for only four people as witnesses. And if our Republican colleagues won't allow those witnesses, they may as well give the president a crown and a scepter; they may as well make him king.""—Sen. Amy Klobuchar
The Democratic-led House
last month voted to impeach
Mr. Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, for just the third time in the nation's history.
Mr. Trump, who has denied any wrongdoing, has urged the Senate to dismiss the articles of impeachment without a trial. But moderate Republicans have been pushing hard behind the scenes to allow a vote on witnesses and documents.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has been coordinating with the White House on impeachment strategy, has said he has enough Republican support to move forward on the proceedings without bipartisan agreement on the trial's structure. Under his plan, senators would wait to determine whether to include witnesses until after the trial begins, which he
expects will be next Tuesday.

Republican senators briefed on draft rules for the trial have said they would likely guarantee a vote on witnesses and documents after opening arguments and a period for written questions.
Why this matters: Democrats have demanded the ability to call witnesses and subpoena documents to gather more information than what came out during the House investigation.
Meanwhile, after a weekslong wait the House plans to vote Wednesday to name the Democrats who will argue the case for Mr. Trump's removal. The chamber will then send the articles over to the Senate.
Sens. Sanders, Warren and Klobuchar have said they would fulfill their senatorial duties and participate in any trial. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, who didn't qualify for Tuesday's debate, would also be affected. The senators have said they would use surrogates on the campaign trail.
""This debate isn't real.""—Sen. Amy Klobuchar
The Democratic presidential candidates again sparred over health care reform.
Ms. Klobuchar said many members of Congress and Democratic governors don't support Medicare for All and a public option should be pursued in addition to coverage for mental health, disabilities and long-term care insurance.
Health care was expected to come up in the debate after Mr. Trump this week tweeted that he had saved pre-existing conditions. The Trump administration has backed a lawsuit that would invalidate the Affordable Care Act, which bars insurers from denying people health coverage because of past and current medical issues.
The administration is also arguing against having the Supreme Court fast-track consideration of the lawsuit, so the court may not decide until after the 2020 presidential election.
Why this matters: Polls show voters are more eager to hear concrete ideas about lowering health costs, particularly for prescription drugs, even though the debate again focused heavily on Medicare for All compared to the public option.
Candidates sparred over the costs of their proposals, with Mr. Sanders saying the average family would ultimately benefit from Medicare for All whereas Mr. Biden called for reinstating Obamacare with the addition of a public option.
Ms. Klobuchar's point, echoing that of many moderate critics, was that the debate over Medicare for All was largely irrelevant because it is so unlikely to ever pass through Congress.

WASHINGTON -- In six days of arguments on the Senate floor, Democrats and the White House defense team sparred over whether the president abused the power of his office and obstructed Congress -- and whether those actions would merit his removal from office.
In one major development after the Democrats finished their arguments, the New York Times revealed that former national security adviser John Bolton, in a draft of his forthcoming book, wrote that President Trump told him aid to Ukraine was conditioned on investigations.
Here is a breakdown of the arguments the House Democratic impeachment managers made on key points, and how the Trump team responded:
Ukraine Aid
Impeachment Managers: The Democrats alleged Mr. Trump leveraged nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine to pressure Kyiv to undertake investigations that could benefit him politically. Democrats said that amounted to an effort to interfere in the 2020 election. The aid was released after pressure from Congress.
Trump's Defense: Mr. Trump's team noted the aid to Ukraine was released in September without any announcement of investigations by Ukraine. President Trump denied the conversation Mr. Bolton described in his book.
July 25 Call
Impeachment Managers: Democrats said the White House sought to cover up a July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president -- in which Mr. Trump asked him to investigate Democrat Joe Biden and his son and alleged election interference -- by moving the transcript to a classified server typically reserved for the nation's top secrets.
Trump Defense: Lawyers said the White House wasn't seeking to hide the transcript of the July 25 phone call because it was both preserved on a White House server and, in September, made public. The lawyers also pointed to the fact that Mr. Trump didn't link aid to investigations on the call.
Articles of Impeachment
Impeachment Managers: Aside from blocking aid, Democrats said, the president obstructed the impeachment investigation by blocking evidence and testimony sought by House investigators.
Trump's Defense: The president's team argued the articles of impeachment are constitutionally deficient and overly broad. The lawyers also argued that Democrats don't allege that the president committed a crime, which they said is necessary to warrant removal from office.
Removal From Office
Impeachment Managers: The president poses a national security threat to the country and, said Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), an ""imminent threat to the integrity of our democracy"" and therefore must be removed prior to the 2020 election.
Trump's Defense: Mr. Trump's lawyers said the president is up for re-election in less than 10 months and the choice should be left to the voters. The lawyers also countered Democrats' calls for urgency in removing the president from office by noting that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) waited a month to turn over the articles of impeachment to the Senate.
Senate Witnesses
Impeachment Managers: Democrats argued the Senate should call new witnesses who could offer first-hand accounts of the president's motivation for holding up aid to Ukraine.
Trump's Defense: The president's team said the House was responsible for collecting testimony and documents, and in voting for the articles of impeachment determined it had enough evidence to warrant the president's removal from office.

Super Tuesday propelled Joe Biden into a two-way race for the Democratic nomination with Bernie Sanders, and
last night's series of victorie
s strengthened the former vice president's standing in the race for the Democratic nomination. While we watch to see if the surge lifts him to the nomination and then the White House, let's take a look at what business can expect from Mr. Biden.
Would it simply be a continuation of policies pursued during President Barack Obama's eight years in office?
Mr. Biden's tenure as vice president, of course, started amid a crippling financial crisis and was followed by a long period of slow-growth recovery.
At the time,
executives often complained
about the buildup of new regulations. Politicians
criticized companies for underinvesting
, hiring too slowly and hoarding corporate cash overseas.
Now, he's running against the more liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders. The emergence of ""middle-of-the-road Joe"" is seen as positive for business by comparison, said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst for Raymond James Financial Inc.
But every candidate needs to build coalitions. Winning the support of progressive voters could force Mr. Biden to adopt more aggressive positions on taxation or workers' rights.
Today, Mr. Biden is campaigning as an ardently pro-worker candidate who criticizes practices like stock buybacks and excessive executive compensation. His record suggests that, at heart, he's a pragmatist reasonably friendly to business interests.
Which Joe Biden would business get if he wins the White House? Here's where he stands on key issues:
Trade: Mr. Biden was among the Democrats voting in favor of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, and played a key role in the Obama administration's support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Mr. Biden now says he would renegotiate TPP as a counterweight to China. He has indicated the U.S. does need to remain tough on China—particularly in areas of intellectual property theft or technology transfers—but advocates for a broader coalition of support among trading partners.
Mr. Biden wouldn't completely abandon tariffs as a stick or quotas on carbon-intensive goods from countries failing to meet environmental obligations.
Taxes: If Mr. Biden wins the nomination, taxes are one of the areas where business leaders should feel they ""dodged a bullet compared with Sanders or Elizabeth Warren,"" said Allison Schrager, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. Mr. Biden's plan picks up certain proposals from the end of the Obama administration that Mr. Trump killed.
While Mr. Biden wants to increase the corporate tax rate—from 21%, where Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cut has left it—he doesn't want to return to the 35% precut rate. He proposes a 28% income-tax rate on companies and a 15% minimum tax on global book income with a credit for foreign taxes paid, according to the
Urban Institute's analysis
.
Credits would limit some of the increase. These include tax credits targeting communities hit hard by mass layoffs; electric-car and solar subsidies; and enhanced incentives for carbon capture. Mr. Biden's plan would eliminate certain tax benefits for the real-estate industry, fossil-fuel companies and pharmaceutical companies.
Environment: Mr. Biden has said he wants to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord and sees the Green New Deal as a ""framework"" for progress. He plans to hold oil executives accountable to commitments to alternative energy.
But ""he's not an ideologue,"" Mr. Mills said. Other analysts agree, saying Mr. Biden is more of an incrementalist, meaning his climate commitment may be more accommodating to economic growth and corporate profits.
Uncertainty: Mr. Trump's erratic tweeting and trade wars create confusion even when the economy is strong, some business leaders say. Concern about the coronavirus has slowed growth, and the election is sure to feature questions about who can restore confidence.
Mr. Biden is ""more predictable than Trump—at least he's on the spectrum of what we consider normal for communication styles,"" Ms. Schrager said. This makes a difference for companies making long-term investment decisions.
Workers: Mr. Biden has said
employees don't have enough leverage
, partially because of globalization and partially because declining unionization has weakened their bargaining power with management.
Mr. Biden favors a $15 per hour minimum wage (a proposal often opposed by business trade groups) and wants to revise worker classifications that determines who receives overtime pay.

WASHINGTON—Former Vice President Joe Biden won the South Carolina Democratic presidential primary, giving him a much-needed boost in a race that had been dominated by front-runner Bernie Sanders.
Mr. Biden's victory in South Carolina marked the first time he has won a presidential contest after two unsuccessful runs for the Democratic nomination in 1988 and 2008. The former vice president, who found himself in a tenuous position after
disappointing showings in Iowa
and New Hampshire this year, said he was staging a comeback in the Democratic primaries, declaring Saturday night that ""for all those of you who have been knocked down, counted out and left behind, this is your campaign.""
""Now, thanks to all of you, the heart of the Democratic Party, we just won, and we won big because of you,"" Mr. Biden, flanked by members of his family and Rep. James Clyburn, the top African-American serving in the House, said to cheers at a party in Columbia, S.C. ""We are very much alive.""
The results Saturday could help the former vice president's chances in 14 states that head to the polls next week on what's known as Super Tuesday, when more than a third of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention will be at stake.
Mr. Biden is part of a still-crowded field of Democrats competing for the party's nomination to challenge President Trump in November. Mr. Sanders emerged out of the first three states to vote
as a clear front-runner
, leaving more moderate Democrats anxious about the potential of nominating a self-described democratic socialist.
On Sunday, the Sanders campaign announced it raised $46.5 million in February from more than 2.2 million donations. That number dwarfs the $25 million Mr. Sanders
raised in January
. In the year since he announced, Mr. Sanders has brought in more than $167 million from over 8.7 million individual donations.
Mr. Biden on Saturday urged the party to rally behind his candidacy, calling himself a ""lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama-Biden Democrat.""
""We have an option of winning big or losing big, that's the choice,"" Mr. Biden said.
Addressing supporters in Virginia Beach Saturday night, Mr. Sanders, who appeared poised to finish second in South Carolina with 86% of precincts reporting, reminded them that he won the popular vote in Iowa and
held up his victories in the New Hampshire primary
and Nevada caucuses.
""But you cannot win 'em all … and tonight, we did not win in South Carolina,"" Mr. Sanders said, adding it wouldn't be ""the only defeat.""
""There are a lot of states in this country. Nobody wins 'em all,"" he said to boos. ""I want to congratulate Joe Biden on his victory tonight. And now we head to Super Tuesday.""
Billionaire Tom Steyer, who had dedicated much of his resources to South Carolina, said he was
dropping out of the race
after appearing set to place third.
""I said if I didn't see a path to winning that I'd suspend my campaign, and honestly, I can't see a path where I can win the presidency,"" Mr. Steyer told supporters in Columbia, S.C.
Mr. Biden's South Carolina win could help him convince voters that he is the moderate Democrat best positioned to slow Mr. Sanders's rise and to face Mr. Trump. Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar have also been competing in the same lane.
Most of Mr. Biden's rivals spent less time than he did in South Carolina, due in part to the former vice president's strength in the state. He has long had the most support among African-American voters who make up a significant chunk of the state's Democratic electorate, and
exit poll data
from the Washington Post showed he maintained a big lead with that group.
Several Democrats were already pivoting to Super Tuesday states as results came in on Saturday.
Mr. Sanders campaigned in Massachusetts and Virginia; Ms. Klobuchar made stops in Tennessee, Virginia, Maine and North Carolina; Mr. Buttigieg held a virtual town-hall meeting in South Carolina but was otherwise in Tennessee and North Carolina; and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren traveled to Arkansas and Texas.
Ms. Warren, speaking to supporters in Texas, which votes on Super Tuesday, congratulated Mr. Biden and reiterated that she planned to stay in the race for ""the long haul.""
""I'll be the first to say that the first four contests haven't gone exactly as I'd hoped. We want to gain as many delegates to the convention as we can—from California to right here in Texas,"" Ms. Warren said in Houston. ""It may take days or even longer to know the full results from Super Tuesday, but they will be critical in sorting out who our nominee will be this year.""
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who wasn't on the ballot in South Carolina and has instead
poured millions of dollars into states
that vote Tuesday, held events in Virginia and North Carolina.
In response to Mr. Biden's victory on Saturday, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign emphasized that the former mayor hadn't yet been on the ballot.
""Mike is the only candidate to campaign in all fourteen Super Tuesday states over the last two months and we look forward to Tuesday,"" Mr. Bloomberg's campaign manager, Kevin Sheekey, said in a statement. ""Mike's record of successfully leading and managing through crises and challenges is exactly what Americans are looking for in a new President.""
A Bloomberg campaign aide cited internal data showing that if he dropped out, it would put Mr. Sanders on a stronger path to a pledged delegate majority.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
To what extent will Joe Biden's performance Saturday in South Carolina determine his fate in the Democratic nomination race? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Biden, who had camped out in South Carolina after placing second in the Nevada caucuses, campaigned extensively among black voters in the final days before the state's primary. He has argued that other centrist candidates, such as Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, lack sufficient support from nonwhite voters to have a plausible path to the nomination.
Although Mr. Biden has so far avoided publicly calling on his rivals to step aside, his campaign began suggesting members of the field should reconsider their futures after his South Carolina victory.
""If you are a candidate and you have not shown that you can get traction with the core of the Democratic Party, with African-American voters, then you have to take a hard look at your path and what your goals are,"" said T.J. Ducklo, a Biden spokesman.
In the days leading up to the primary, Mr. Biden earned
Mr. Clyburn's influential endorsement
, as well as that of Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, a former governor and vice-presidential candidate who is popular in his home state, which votes on Tuesday.
Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe also threw his support behind Mr. Biden following his victory in South Carolina.
""We can't afford four more years of Donald Trump's hate-driven chaos and Joe Biden is the candidate with the character, experience, and broad appeal to defeat him,"" Mr. McAuliffe, who served as Virginia's governor from 2014 to 2018, said in a statement. ""I've always said that our best leader is one who can build a broad coalition, including African-American voters who are the heart of the Democratic Party. After South Carolina, it is clear Joe Biden is that leader.""
Unite the Country, a political-action committee supporting Mr. Biden's candidacy, has put more than $1.2 million into advertising in the Super Tuesday states of Arkansas, Alabama, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia, according to Federal Election Commission filings.
At Mr. Biden's South Carolina primary celebration, his supporters were jubilant as they awaited the results and counted down the final seconds before the polls closed.

When the broadcast networks immediately called the primary for Mr. Biden, the crowd erupted, waving American flags and blue Biden campaign posters.
""I figured when he got to South Carolina, he would do a lot better,"" said Brandon Koon, who raised a Biden campaign sign. ""He was a loyal vice president to Obama, and I liked Obama a whole lot.""
""He's a good, decent, honest man,"" he added of Mr. Biden.
It is too soon to tell whether the South Carolina results will reshape the trajectory of a race that many Democrats previously believed was Mr. Sanders's to lose.
Mr. Sanders held a Saturday afternoon rally in Boston, where he didn't mention the vote under way in South Carolina despite suggesting in recent days that he had a shot at winning the state. In 2016, Mr. Sanders lost South Carolina to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by 48 points.
Voters who attended Mr. Sanders's rally in Boston played down the significance of South Carolina.
""I don't think it matters,"" said Bill Shine, a 62-year-old doctor from Shrewsbury, Mass.
At a Saturday afternoon rally in Raleigh, N.C., Mr. Biden said a victory in South Carolina would reverberate in coming contests on March 3.
""I'll tell you what, the full comeback starts in South Carolina,"" he told a boisterous crowd of about 1,000 at St. Augustine's University. ""We're going to win here as well, and then it's a straight path to the nomination for president of the United States of America.""

Bernie Sanders made a case for continuing in the 2020 race, challenging his front-running rival, Joe Biden, to embrace a series of liberal causes, as the former vice president sought to unite the Democratic Party behind his presidential bid.
Mr. Sanders told reporters in Burlington, Vt., that Tuesday ""was not a good night for our campaign."" However, he said he still intended to debate the former vice president
Sunday in Phoenix
and press him on climate change, income inequality and more.
The Vermont senator touted the popularity of some of his ideas with Democrats but said his campaign often hears that voters see Mr. Biden as a better bet against President Trump in the November election.
""While our campaign has won the ideological debate, we are losing the debate over electability,"" Mr. Sanders said.
The frank assessment of his campaign came as Mr. Biden strengthened his pathway to the Democratic presidential nomination with his series of victories Tuesday.
Mr. Biden
won in the key battleground state of Michigan
and in Missouri, Mississippi and Idaho with a coalition of African-Americans, suburbanites and older voters. It was a further sign of Mr. Biden's surge in just a matter of weeks from a candidate who appeared headed for a third failed presidential bid to the delegate leader and front-runner. The wins also prompted calls from inside the party to unite around his candidacy and direct its full attention to Mr. Trump.
""Last night, Joe Biden expanded his coalition and continues to demonstrate he is the candidate who can unite the Democratic Party,"" T.J. Ducklo, a Biden campaign spokesman, said Wednesday. ""Our campaign is focused on the task at hand: defeating Donald Trump, so we can make real, lasting progressive change in this country and in people's lives.""
The former vice president's turnaround has reordered the contest for the Democratic nomination over the past few weeks and put pressure on Mr. Sanders to prove he has a viable path forward.
On Wednesday morning, Mr. Sanders was declared the winner of the North Dakota caucuses, while the two candidates were locked in a tight race in Washington state. With 67% of precincts reporting, each candidate had about a third of the vote in that state.
Tad Devine, the chief strategist of Mr. Sanders's 2016 campaign who most recently helped the presidential campaign of Andrew Yang, said in an interview he didn't see ""a realistic pathway to the nomination"" for Mr. Sanders.

""The question he has to confront this time, which was not on the play last time, is are you going to enable another four years of Donald Trump by participating in this process longer? And are you going to handicap Biden's ability to defeat Trump? That's a very big issue,"" said Mr. Devine, who noted he had not spoken to the senator since the last presidential bid.
Mr. Biden reached out to the Vermont senator's supporters Tuesday evening as he sought to position himself as a Democratic candidate the party could rally around.
""I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion,"" Mr. Biden said in Philadelphia. ""We share a common goal and together, we'll defeat Donald Trump. We'll defeat him together.""
Encouraged by Tuesday's results, Mr. Biden's allies began making plans for a monthslong battle against Mr. Trump. Unite the Country, a pro-Biden super PAC, said in a memo to supporters that ""the functional primary phase of this election is over.""
The group said it had raised nearly $10 million, ""with triple that in commitments,"" during the past 10 days.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How do you expect Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders to adjust their campaign strategies before their Sunday debate? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Biden's strong performance, after
winning 10 states just a week ago on Super Tuesday
, also spurred two deep-pocketed liberal groups to get behind him and say the general-election campaign against Mr. Trump was starting. Priorities USA and American Bridge had remained neutral throughout the primary.
""The math is now clear. Joe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee for President and @prioritiesUSA is going to do everything we can to help him defeat Donald Trump in November,"" tweeted Priorities USA Chairman Guy Cecil just minutes before the Associated Press declared Mr. Biden the winner in the Michigan primary.
American Bridge announced a $2.2 million ad buy in Pennsylvania as it declared it was ""all in"" for Mr. Biden.
With those groups lining up behind Mr. Biden, Sunday's debate took on more importance, as it will be the first time the two men will go head-to-head.
Rep. Tim Ryan (D., Ohio), a Biden supporter, said on CNN that he would welcome a debate of ideas this weekend but cautioned that Mr. Sanders shouldn't use the opportunity to tear down Mr. Biden.
""I think at this point, trashing each other is not in the best interest of, not just the Democratic Party, but bringing some unity to this country,"" he said.
But Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said Wednesday on CNN that the campaign wouldn't tell Mr. Sanders what to do. Instead, she made an appeal to his supporters and young voters.
""I think there is a tremendous amount that we agree on, and I would say to Bernie Sanders supporters that if they're looking for a home, they've got one with Joe Biden,"" Ms. Bedingfield said.
Mr. Biden has presented himself as the Democrat best able to challenge Mr. Trump in general-election battlegrounds such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, which was the first of those states to weigh in on the Democratic race. With 99% of precincts reporting, Mr. Biden had about 53% of the vote to about 37% for Mr. Sanders. Mr. Sanders narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton in the state in the 2016 nominating contest.
Mr. Biden was projected the winner in Mississippi, Missouri and Michigan shortly after the states' polls closed, an early sign of his clout in three states with large African-American voting blocs. Black voters made up about two-thirds of the electorate in Mississippi, exit polls showed. Mr. Biden had won more than 80% of support in the state, with about 98% of precincts reporting.
The former vice president campaigned ahead of the Missouri primary among African-Americans in St. Louis and Kansas City. With about 100% of precincts reporting, Mr. Biden had about 60% of the vote in Missouri.
Mr. Biden's delegate edge early Wednesday was 843 to 681 over Mr. Sanders, according to a Wall Street Journal delegate tracker, even as Super Tuesday states such as California and Colorado, which Mr. Sanders carried, continue to process election results.
The campaigns have competed for votes against the backdrop of growing economic concerns over the
spread of the coronavirus
. Both candidates have questioned Mr. Trump's handling of the crisis in recent days, and on Tuesday they each canceled rallies in Cleveland, ahead of Ohio's primary next week, citing public-health concerns.
In response to the threat of the virus, the Democratic National Committee also decided to
forgo an audience at Sunday's debate.

Mr. Biden's campaign announced Wednesday it had formed a health advisory committee of medical and national security experts to advise it on the steps it should take ""to minimize health risks for the candidate, staff and supporters."" Based on conversations with the committee and elected officials in Illinois and Florida, the campaign said it decided not to hold large gatherings in those states ahead of next week's primaries. Instead, the campaign will hold virtual events.
Mr. Biden is also expected to address the response to the novel coronavirus during remarks in Wilmington, Del., on Thursday.
Exit polls coming in with the results showed Mr. Biden winning handily among black and older voters and performing well with those who had at least a college degree. Mr. Biden was also prevailing in cities such as St. Louis, Kansas City and Detroit and in their surrounding areas—including Oakland County, Mich., a general-election battleground.
Mr. Sanders maintained a substantial advantage over Mr. Biden among young voters, exit polls showed. The Vermont senator staked much of his campaign on motivating the young as well as others disenchanted with current politics to come to the polls.

WASHINGTON—As former Vice President Joe Biden revived his presidential campaign with a
string of victories on Tuesday
, candidates in congressional primaries also advanced to the next round of voting in a number of closely watched contests.
House Democrats hope to maintain and even expand on the ground they gained in the 2018 midterm elections this fall, while Republicans aim to defend their 53-seat Senate majority.
Here are some top takeaways from last night's results:
Loyalty to Trump Remains Central to Success in GOP
Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions will advance to a March 31 runoff in the Republican primary race to win back his old Senate seat in Alabama. That election has become a contest of

fealty to President Trump
. Tommy Tuberville, the former Auburn University football head coach, will face Mr. Sessions in the runoff at the end of March.
Mr. Sessions has been the subject of ridicule from Mr. Trump over his decision to recuse himself from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. While he refrained from criticizing Mr. Sessions during the initial phase of the race, the president took to Twitter on Wednesday morning to attack him.
Mr. Sessions didn't ""have the wisdom or courage to stare down & end the phony Russia Witch Hunt."" The eventual Republican nominee will face Democratic Sen. Doug Jones, who won the Alabama Senate seat in 2017 by less than 2 percentage points after the Republican candidate, Roy Moore, was accused by several women of sexual misconduct.
In a congressional seat in the Houston area, a grandson of former President George H.W. Bush won't advance to a May 26 runoff in the Republican race to succeed Rep. Pete Olson (R., Texas), who is retiring after this term. Pierce Bush fell short against Troy Nehls, a county sheriff, and Kathaleen Wall, who spent heavily to broadcast support for building a border wall.
Mr. Trump's endorsement of Ronny Jackson, formerly the White House physician, helped carry him to a runoff in another Texas congressional district. But Mr. Jackson still trailed the lead Republican, Josh Winegarner, 38.9% to 19.8% in the crowded primary to succeed Rep. Mac Thornberry (R., Texas).
Incumbents Survive Primary Challenges
Rep. Kay Granger (R., Texas), the top Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, survived a primary challenge backed by heavy outside spending. She faced a conservative challenger, Chris Putnam, who had attacked her as a Washington insider insufficiently supportive of President Trump.
The race had pit several outside conservative groups against each other, with the political wing of the conservative Club For Growth spending heavily to oppose Ms. Granger. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super political-action committee affiliated with House GOP leadership, spent more than $1.3 million defending Ms. Granger.
Further south in Texas, Rep. Henry Cuellar (D., Texas) narrowly beat Jessica Cisneros, a 26-year-old who has
criticized Mr. Cuellar as too conservative
and who received financial support from several national groups, the Associated Press projected.
Several other incumbents in both the House and Senate facing challengers emerged from Tuesday unscathed.
Senate Democrats' Favored Candidates Advance
In North Carolina, Cal Cunningham, a former state lawmaker and Army veteran, won the Democratic nomination to run against Republican Sen. Thom Tillis this fall. Mr. Cunningham had the support of national Democrats, and national Republicans ran advertisements boosting one of Mr. Cunningham's competitors in the primary.
North Carolina will be one of a handful of deeply competitive Senate races this fall, with Democrats hoping to also compete in a number of other states that have traditionally leaned more conservative.

Like Mr. Cunningham, Ms. Hegar has the support of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. She will aim to take on Republican Sen.

Wesley Hunt, an African-American Army veteran, won the Republican nomination in a Houston-area congressional district. He will face Rep. Lizzie Fletcher (D., Texas), who flipped the seat in 2018.

National Republicans had hoped Mr. Hunt would be able to avoid a runoff in a seat seen as a bellwether for GOP efforts to regain support in 2020.

The first primary elections since
the coronavirus pandemic
engulfed the nation were winding down Tuesday in Florida and Illinois and continuing in Arizona as candidates, voters and election officials tried to navigate a new and challenging environment.

Polls indicated former Vice President Joe Biden was poised to dominate
the day's voting
, potentially adding significantly to his delegate advantage over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in a Democratic presidential nomination race that appeared to be winding down.

Ohio 

pushed back a primary
scheduled for Tuesday because of concerns about the virus, joining a growing list of states that have delayed their contests until May or June in hopes the situation will improve.

On the eve of the balloting, an Ohio court rejected a request to postpone the state's primary until June 2 as Republican Gov. Mike DeWine had recommended. The in-person voting was subsequently placed on hold after the state's top health official ordered polls closed.

The Ohio Supreme Court denied a last-minute legal challenge to the postponement, and county election boards were deluged with phone calls from confused, frustrated voters.

In a statement released late Tuesday, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez called for states with upcoming primaries and caucuses to use vote by mail and other alternatives to casting ballots in person.

""What happened in Ohio last night has only bred more chaos and confusion,"" he said. ""States that have not yet held primary elections should focus on implementing the aforementioned measures to make it easier and safer for voters to exercise their constitutional right to vote, instead of moving primaries to later in the cycle when timing around the virus remains unpredictable.""

If the former vice president performs well, he could have a majority of the delegates awarded so far and more than half of the 1,991 needed to win the nomination.

A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Sunday showed
Mr. Biden was favored nationally, 61% to 32%
, among those who have already voted in the Democratic primary or plan to do so.

Mr. Biden has already begun trying to unify the party behind him, endorsing policy proposals related to bankruptcy laws and college tuition
in a bid to woo liberals
. Mr. Sanders acknowledged last week that he was losing the ""debate over electability"" among Democratic voters. He could face more pressure to get out of the race if Mr. Biden has a strong showing Tuesday so that the party can focus on competing against President Trump in November.

Florida and Arizona are battleground states, so they may offer some insights into possible general-election trends. This round of contests might be the last significant ones for some time, if more states announce primary postponements.

States that move their contests later than June 9 will need a waiver from the party to avoid losing delegates to the July convention, the DNC wrote in a memo this week.

Voters, sobered by the crisis, also cast ballots in local and state contests as they confronted school closures, travel limitations, event cancellations and a stressed global economy. Germs were also on their minds.

At a polling location inside a Miami fire station, workers wore gloves as they inspected voter identification cards and dispensed hand sanitizer to the visitors. Some voters arrived with their own pens, gloves and disinfecting wipes.

Officials in Chicago, the biggest city within the three states that voted Tuesday, said election-day turnout was running extremely low as nervous voters stayed home. Still, many had cast ballots early. Officials said the previous primary record for such voting was easily surpassed and vote-by-mail applications more than tripled compared with 2016.

James Allen, a Chicago Board of Election Commissioners spokesman, told reporters Tuesday that city election officials failed last week to convince Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker to cancel in-person voting and replace it with vote-by-mail balloting.

That triggered a critical response from Mr. Pritzker's office. Spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh said in a statement that the governor's office had offered ""to provide the National Guard to help staff the election"" as well as assistance in recruiting volunteers to fill in for election workers anxious about staffing polling places.

""The governor cannot unilaterally cancel or delay an election,"" she said. ""Elections are the cornerstone of our democracy and we could not risk confusion and disenfranchisement in the courts. No one is saying this is a perfect solution. We have no perfect solutions at the moment. We only have the least bad solutions.""

Some Chicago polls opened late because workers didn't show up or equipment wasn't delivered on time, while some voters were confused about where they were supposed to vote after about 200 of the city's 2,069 precinct voting locations had to be moved.

Voting-rights advocates said they fielded questions from confused voters and poll workers in multiple states because of changes made to polling locations to avoid nursing homes and other vulnerable sites.

""It's unprecedented for us to be addressing this much confusion around basic questions that voters have during a primary election, like where is my polling place,"" Ami Gandhi, senior counsel at the Chicago Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, told reporters.

She said there has been a lack of guidance for people who are homebound as a result of coronavirus concerns. ""Those who live in nursing homes or other similar facilities who no longer have the option of voting in their residence are really in a tough situation,"" Ms. Gandhi said.

More than half of state primaries and caucuses have been held, and turnout was trending higher before the outbreak pushed people back into their homes to try to slow the spread of the virus.

""I would guess that the election-day component of the turnout may be down,"" said David Hopkins, a political-science professor at Boston College.

Voting, like virtually every aspect of the presidential race, has been transformed by the outbreak.

The large rallies that for a year fueled Mr. Sanders's campaign have been replaced by online appearances transmitted into the homes of cloistered supporters. Mr. Biden is restructuring his fundraising operation, which had previously leveraged in-person events. Uncertainty remains about how campaigning will be affected for the general election.

Mike Casca, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said in an emailed statement Tuesday that the campaign wasn't conducting its usual get-out-the-vote efforts.

""We are making clear to voters that we believe going to the polls amid the coronavirus outbreak is a personal decision and we respect whichever choice they make,"" he said. ""We are also passing along guidance from the CDC on staying safe during the crisis.""

Unlike previous events held on the eve of primaries, Mr. Sanders during a virtual rally Monday evening didn't ask his supporters to vote for him. Mr. Biden tweeted Tuesday that people should ""vote by mail or curbside vote if you can. If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don't touch your face, and stay 6' from others in line.""

The crisis and postponement of state contests later in March and early April makes it especially hard for Mr. Sanders to gain ground on Mr. Biden, Mr. Hopkins said.

""The race has sort of been frozen in place,"" he said. ""If he wants to stay in the race, there isn't going to be much of a race for a while.""

The coronavirus pandemic is jolting the political debate over health care in the 2020 election campaign, with Democrats arguing the crisis shows the damage the Trump administration has done to the health-care safety net and the need for a larger federal role in providing coverage.
Health care was already a top issue for voters before the virus began spreading in the U.S. Now, with cases across 46 states and Washington, D.C., coronavirus is providing a platform for Democrats to highlight high medical costs and a lack of coverage, which they say their policy proposals would fix. Democratic presidential candidates are expected to criticize President Trump's response to the virus at Sunday night's debate.
Trump administration officials counter that they have expanded access to more affordable health-care plans. The Trump re-election campaign has sought to criticize some of the most polarizing aspects of the Democratic rivals' health plans, such as coverage for undocumented immigrants. ""Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden are two sides of the same extreme coin,"" the Trump re-election campaign tweeted on March 6. ""They both support making American families and workers pay for health care for illegal aliens.""
Democrats argue that the Trump administration's changes to the Affordable Care Act have weakened coverage for millions of Americans, and could leave people who need treatment for coronavirus with high health-care bills. They point to the expansion of health plans that can deny coverage and don't have to cover all of the ACA's minimum benefits, as well as an administration plan to back states that want to change Medicaid's open-ended federal funding into a more limited block grant that Democrats say would hurt enrollment.
Republicans have praised the administration's response and actions they say the White House has taken to make health coverage more affordable. They have accused Democrats of using coronavirus to score political points.
Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.), who is set to be Mr. Trump's chief of staff, in a Feb. 25 tweet said that ""the left wants to control: your health care.""
References to the coronavirus have recently started to appear in political advertising, as groups aligned with Democrats try to leverage the topic.
A TV ad that mentions the virus and is critical of Republican Sen. Steve Daines first appeared in Montana on Thursday, data from ad-tracking firm Kantar/CMAG shows. The spot is sponsored by Protect Our Care, a group that supports the Affordable Care Act.
""Too many Montana families go to sleep at night worried about health care, coverage, costs and now the fear of coronavirus,"" says the ad, which had run 29 times in Billings and Missoula through Thursday.
""It's absolutely going to be a topic,"" said Ken Goldstein, a University of San Francisco political-science professor who has studied campaign advertising for decades. ""The question for campaigns and strategists and ad makers is how you make it a topic and when you make it a topic.""
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How might a Democratic health-care plan benefit Americans during a health crisis? Join the conversation below.
At a time when Americans have many concerns related to the outbreak on their minds, he said, running political ads now on the outbreak has advantages and disadvantages.
""It may not be the best time to inject political messages,"" Mr. Goldstein said. ""On the other hand, people are going to be watching a lot of television and be on the internet and seeing ads. We are about to see record internet usage, video usage and TV ratings.""
Democratic presidential candidates are on the offensive on the campaign trail. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a proponent of Medicare for All, said at a March 9 rally that the coronavirus outbreak shows the ""insanity"" of a system where people can't afford to see a doctor.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, who has pushed his own plan that would expand the ACA and add an option for people to buy into a federal health plan, blamed Mr. Trump for taking steps to weaken the U.S. health system.
""Protecting the health and safety of the American people is the most important job of any president—and unfortunately, this virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration,"" Mr. Biden said Thursday. ""Our government's ability to respond effectively has been undermined by the hollowing-out of our agencies and the disparagement of science. ""
Billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was among the first to use the virus in TV ads as part of a political campaign. He ran two different spots on the topic, including one that was three minutes long, before he dropped out of the Democratic presidential primary.
Support for the ACA grew to 55% of Americans in February, the highest since the law was enacted 10 years ago, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The support is also up from 51% in October, before coronavirus cases emerged in the U.S.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ran digital ads critical of Trump officials who initially declined to ensure that any vaccine would be affordable. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California criticized the ads as playing politics with coronavirus.
The criticisms tap into a growing public angst about the virus and the administration's response.
""People see Trump making it easier for them to get coronavirus and then harder for them to get health care,"" said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist. ""That seems like a challenging agenda to sell to voters.""
According to a Quinnipiac University poll released on March 9, 49% of voters disapprove of the way Mr. Trump is handling the coronavirus response, while 43% approve,
There are sharp divides along political parties, similar to the president's overall job approval rating: 87% of Republicans approve, 83% of Democrats disapprove, and 50% of independents disapprove.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, facing a shrinking path to the Democratic presidential nomination, made a case for continuing in the 2020 race as front-running rival Joe Biden sought to unite the party behind his candidacy.
Mr. Sanders said on Wednesday he intended to participate in a scheduled debate Sunday in Phoenix, where he said he would press the former vice president to move in a more liberal policy direction on issues such as health care and college affordability. The senator from Vermont also offered a frank assessment of his chances a day after Mr. Biden strengthened his bid for the nomination with victories in Tuesday's contests, most notably a blowout in Michigan.
The previous evening ""was not a good night for our campaign,"" Mr. Sanders said in Burlington, Vt. He said his campaign often hears on the trail that voters see Mr. Biden as a better bet against President Trump in November, even as some of Mr. Sanders's progressive policy ideas are popular among Democrats.
""While our campaign has won the ideological debate, we are losing the debate over electability,"" Mr. Sanders said.
Mr. Biden won in Michigan by 17 percentage points over Mr. Sanders, and he also scored victories in Missouri, Mississippi and Idaho with a coalition of African-Americans, suburbanites and older voters. It was a further sign of Mr. Biden's surge in a matter of weeks from a candidate who appeared headed for a third failed presidential bid to the delegate leader and front-runner. The wins also prompted calls from inside the party to unite around his candidacy and direct its full attention to defeating Mr. Trump, a Republican.
""Last night, Joe Biden expanded his coalition and continues to demonstrate he is the candidate who can unite the Democratic Party,"" T.J. Ducklo, a Biden campaign spokesman, said Wednesday.
The former vice president's turnaround has reordered the contest for the Democratic nomination over the past few weeks and put pressure on Mr. Sanders to prove he has a viable path forward.
On Wednesday morning, Mr. Sanders was declared the winner in North Dakota, while the candidates were locked in a tight race in Washington state.
Tad Devine, the chief strategist of Mr. Sanders's 2016 campaign who most recently helped the presidential campaign of Andrew Yang, said in an interview he didn't see ""a realistic pathway to the nomination"" for Mr. Sanders.
""The question he has to confront this time, which was not on the play last time, is: Are you going to enable another four years of Donald Trump by participating in this process longer? And are you going to handicap Biden's ability to defeat Trump? That's a very big issue,"" said Mr. Devine, who noted he hadn't spoken to the senator since the last presidential bid.
Mr. Biden addressed the senator's supporters Tuesday evening as he sought to position himself as the candidate the party could rally around.
""I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion,"" Mr. Biden said in Philadelphia. ""We share a common goal and together, we'll defeat Donald Trump. We'll defeat him together.""
Encouraged by Tuesday's results, Mr. Biden's allies began making plans for a monthslong battle against Mr. Trump.
Unite the Country, a pro-Biden super PAC, said in a memo to supporters that ""the functional primary phase of this election is over.""
The group said it had raised nearly $10 million, ""with triple that in commitments,"" during the past 10 days.
Mr. Biden's strong performance, after winning 10 states a week ago on Super Tuesday, also spurred two deep-pocketed liberal groups to get behind him and say the general-election campaign against Mr. Trump was starting. Priorities USA and American Bridge had remained neutral throughout the primary.
With those groups lining up behind Mr. Biden, Sunday's debate took on more importance as it will be the first time the two men will go head-to-head.
Rep. Tim Ryan (D., Ohio), a Biden supporter, said on CNN that he would welcome a debate of ideas this weekend but cautioned that Mr. Sanders shouldn't use the opportunity to tear down Mr. Biden.
""I think at this point, trashing each other is not in the best interest of, not just the Democratic Party, but bringing some unity to this country,"" he said.
Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said Wednesday on CNN that the campaign wouldn't tell Mr. Sanders what to do. Instead, she made an appeal to his supporters and young voters.
""I think there is a tremendous amount that we agree on, and I would say to Bernie Sanders supporters that if they're looking for a home, they've got one with Joe Biden,"" Ms. Bedingfield said.
Mr. Biden's edge over Mr. Sanders in convention delegates was 861 to 710 Wednesday afternoon, according to a Wall Street Journal tracker. The Biden campaign suggested in a memo Wednesday night that it may have a lead of more than 300 delegates over Mr. Sanders after next week's primaries in four states.
""Should our broad base of support remain. . .it will be nearly impossible for Sanders to recoup his current delegate disadvantage,"" the campaign said. The Sanders campaign didn't respond to the memo.
The campaigns have competed for votes against the backdrop of growing concerns over the spread of the coronavirus. Both candidates have questioned Mr. Trump's handling of the crisis, and on Tuesday they each canceled rallies in Cleveland.

Just a few weeks ago, Joe Biden was fresh off a primary win in South Carolina but had raised less than half as much campaign cash in February as the Democratic presidential front-runner at the time, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Big-money groups had sprung up in February to help two of Mr. Biden's 2020 competitors, and another, Michael Bloomberg, gave his own campaign almost half a billion dollars during the month to gin up support for his long-shot bid.
Three days into March, none of that would matter. Mr. Biden followed up South Carolina with a winning spree, and almost all other Democratic presidential candidates quickly dropped out. The former vice president's only remaining rival, Mr. Sanders, faces an unlikely path to the nomination.
New presidential fundraising reports filed with the Federal Election Commission late Friday reveal the extent of the campaign cash disparity just before the Democratic nomination contest narrowed to a two-person race. And they offer the latest evidence that money—whether a multibillion-dollar personal fortune or fount of small donations online—isn't as important in presidential primaries as familiarity.
""The thing that Joe Biden had from the beginning that most of the rest of the candidates didn't was name recognition and brand recognition,"" said Addisu Demissie, who was New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker's presidential campaign manager until he ended his run in January. ""There are so many residual benefits to being that well-known that money can't buy.""
""It isn't a coincidence that the final two candidates are the former vice president and the runner-up in the last presidential election,"" Mr. Demissie said, pointing out that the Vermont senator also began the race as a widely known figure.
The eventual Democratic nominee will face a financially formidable Republican opponent, President Trump. Combined with the Republican National Committee and connected fundraising committees, the president's re-election effort brought in $86 million in February and ended the month with about $225 million in the bank, according to the RNC.
Despite his firm footing for re-election, Mr. Trump—who on March 17 officially locked up the Republican nomination—was financially overmatched in the Republican primary four years ago, and his campaign spent about $242 million
less than Democratic nominee
Hillary Clinton's did in 2016.
A reality television star before he became a politician, Mr. Trump enjoyed wide media coverage and name recognition during the 2016 campaign. That helped offset his need to spend big on TV advertising, political strategists said.
Mr. Biden had a national profile from decades in the U.S. Senate and as President Obama's No. 2., and he enjoyed the strong support of black Democrats in South Carolina and in states that voted in March. But his fundraising lagged behind that of several of his key rivals.
Mr. Biden's February finance reports offer a snapshot of how dire his cash situation was before he overtook Mr. Sanders to become the party's front-runner. Mr. Biden's campaign raised $18 million in February, about half of the $35 million his campaign says it has raised so far in March amid his winning streak.
In February, Mr. Sanders, who has shunned large donors who power many other campaigns, set a personal fundraising record by collecting almost $48 million.
The Biden campaign spent $13 million that month, when the other major candidates accepting donations in the race spent almost $100 million collectively. That doesn't include Mr. Bloomberg, whose campaign spent $467 million in February.
Mr. Bloomberg picked up a disappointingly small number of delegates out of his $935 million overall investment. Still, some of Mr. Bloomberg's wealth will be helping the party's eventual nominee. On Friday, he said
he would transfer
$18 million from his presidential bid to the Democratic National Committee.
Much like the Republican primary in 2016, super PACs spending millions of dollars also appeared to have little effect on the race. The new filings Friday revealed that Persist PAC, which backed Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, was largely funded by physician and Silicon Valley philanthropist Karla Jurvetson.
Dr. Jurvetson donated $14.6 million of the $15.1 million the group raised in the 11 days it operated in February. The bulk of that money went to TV advertising as the super PAC tried to help Ms. Warren revive her campaign after disappointing finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
The Massachusetts senator had centered her campaign on denouncing what she saw as the corrupting influence of money in politics and had criticized the use of such super PACs by the wealthy. But as her campaign struggled, Ms. Warren
accepted the help
, calling it a political necessity.
Ultimately, it didn't make much of a difference. Ms. Warren dropped out of the presidential race on March 5 after failing to win a caucus or primary.

In a break with other tech companies, Facebook Inc. said it wouldn't limit how political advertising targets potential voters, but would instead give users tools to see fewer of those ads on its platforms.
Facebook's stance—that companies shouldn't decide how campaigns are able to reach voters—is at odds with other tech firms' approach to handling political advertising in the run-up to the 2020 election.
Operators of online platforms are under increasing pressure to curb the spread of misleading or false information in the wake of the 2016 presidential campaign, which U.S. intelligence agencies have said was subject to foreign meddling online.
Facebook's announcement Thursday highlighted the divide in opinion on what the company's role should be in elections, as critics—including some Democratic presidential candidates—said the latest decision leaves the door wide open for disinformation.
Share Your Thoughts
What limits to political ads would you want to put on your own Facebook account, if any? Join the conversation below.
Facebook has acknowledged that the spread of disinformation, including through targeted ads, is a problem and has expressed a desire for federal regulation of political advertising online. But its announcement in September that it would exempt politicians' and certain other ads from its third-party fact-checking program fed skepticism about its commitment to combating disinformation on its platform.
The company based its latest decision ""on the principle that people should be able to hear from those who wish to lead them, warts and all, and that what they say should be scrutinized and debated in public,"" according to a blog post from Rob Leathern, Facebook's director of product management. ""This does not mean that politicians can say whatever they like in advertisements on Facebook.""
The post said all Facebook users have to follow its community standards, which ban hate speech, harmful content and content designed to intimidate voters or stop them from exercising their right to vote.
The company's announcement Thursday also included changes that Facebook said will boost transparency in its ad library relating to how political advertisers deploy their messages on its platforms.
Facebook's approach, including giving users more control over what they see,
contrasts with moves
by Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google.
Google earlier this week launched its new policy globally barring advertisers from targeting political messages based on users' interests inferred from their browsing or search histories, among other changes. Twitter stopped accepting most political ads in November.
Facebook acknowledged it considered restricting targeting but ultimately chose not to do so.
The Wall Street Journal previously reported Facebook was weighing, among other steps, raising the minimum number of people who can be targeted in political ads on its platform from 100 to a few thousand. The practice
known as microtargeting
has been criticized for enabling political actors to single out groups for misleading or false ads that aren't exposed to broader public scrutiny.
Facebook said its data showed more than 85% of ad spending by U.S. presidential candidates is for messages aimed at an audience of more than 250,000 people.
The social-media giant said it consulted with a number of nonprofits, political groups and election campaigns—both Democratic and Republican—before reaching its decision.
""Ultimately, we don't think decisions about political ads should be made by private companies, which is why we are arguing for regulation that would apply across the industry,"" Mr. Leathern said, echoing comments Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has made about the need for federal regulation of political advertising.
Reaction to Facebook's latest decision again showed divergent opinions on how the company should treat political ads.
Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said Facebook's decision not to limit targeting allows more Americans to be involved in politics. In any case, he said, there is no escaping political messaging.
""If users do elect to see fewer political ads it still won't stop them from being bombarded by ads from the news media, which are biased and just as political, because there's a loophole in the rule for the media,"" Mr. Murtaugh said.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) criticized Facebook's decision. ""Facebook is doubling down on a policy that hurts our democracy,"" the presidential candidate said in a statement that reiterated her call for
comprehensive federal rules
on digital political ads.
The campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden also was critical of the company. ""Today's announcement is more window dressing around their decision to allow paid misinformation,"" said campaign spokesman Bill Russo.
Tara McGowan, chief executive of Acronym, a progressive nonprofit that tracks political-ad spending among other work, said she largely agreed with Facebook's move to not limit political targeting but hopes the company does more to rein in misinformation and hate speech.
Roughly $3 billion is expected to be spent on political advertising online for the 2020 U.S. election. But with Election Day less than a year away, a lack of uniform rules for the ads has led to confusion about exactly what is allowed on digital platforms, how intensely new policies will be enforced and whether
advertising strategies and budgets
will need to change further.
Watchdogs, including lawmakers and advocacy groups, have called for greater oversight of political advertising following revelations that
Russian entities purchased digital ads
designed to influence the 2016 presidential election.
Facebook's announcement comes two days after the New York Times reported on an internal post by Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth, in which he said he believed the platform played a central role in the 2016 presidential election.
""So was Facebook responsible for Donald Trump getting elected? I think the answer is yes, but not for the reasons anyone thinks. He didn't get elected because of Russia or misinformation or Cambridge Analytica. He got elected because he ran the single best digital ad campaign I've ever seen from any advertiser. Period,"" Mr. Bosworth wrote.
Facebook said seeing fewer political and social-issue ads was a common request from users and that it aims to roll out its new user-control feature in the U.S. early this summer on its main platform and on Instagram. It will later expand to other locations. Other features aimed at increasing ad transparency will launch in the current quarter.
Facebook said while its users have been able to hide all messages from a specific advertiser in their ad preferences, they soon will be able to stop seeing ads based on how an advertiser constructed its list of targeted users.
In addition, users will be able to opt in to see messages that are directed at a group that didn't automatically include them.
Efforts to block political advertising likely wouldn't have a large impact on Facebook's top line. In October Mr. Zuckerberg said on an earnings call he estimated political ads would account for less than 0.5% of the company's total revenue in 2020.

WASHINGTON—A Republican senator who party leaders feared might join Democrats in seeking new testimony said Thursday night he will vote against calling witnesses, bolstering the GOP's chances of bringing the
impeachment trial of President Trump
to a rapid conclusion.
Sen. Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.) announced his plan after senators wrapped their second and
final day of questioning
Mr. Trump's legal team and House Democratic impeachment managers, during which the two sides sparred over the
limits of executive and congressional power
while revealing little new information.
Mr. Alexander said he believed that Democrats proved their core allegation that Mr.
Trump withheld aid from Ukraine
to pressure Kyiv to launch investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. But he said those actions, while inappropriate, didn't merit the president's removal from office, and therefore no witnesses were needed.
""There is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the U.S. Constitution's high bar for an impeachable offense,"" Mr.
Alexander tweeted
.
Mr. Alexander had notified Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) of his decision before announcing it. Mr. McConnell, leaving the Capitol on Thursday, said only: ""Tomorrow's a big day.""
Another GOP swing vote, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said she would vote in favor of hearing new testimony, saying that hearing from witnesses would allow each side ""to more fully and fairly make their case, resolve any ambiguities and provide additional clarity."" But Democrats need four Republicans to join them for the vote to be successful.
While Mr. Alexander's decision doesn't mean Republicans are certain to have enough votes to block new testimony, it suggests the GOP is in a good position ahead of Friday's vote, which is likely to pave the way for Mr. Trump's swift acquittal. Mr. Alexander, who was spotted reading Jon Meacham's ""Impeachment: An American History"" in the Senate chamber earlier Thursday, had remained silent over the course of the week about how he might vote.
In addition to Ms. Collins, Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) has said he is interested in hearing from witnesses. And Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska) said late Thursday she is still on the fence.
On Tuesday, Mr. McConnell told Republicans they didn't yet have the
votes to block the measure
. In the days since, Republicans have expressed more confidence.
At Thursday's GOP lunch, Mr. McConnell didn't disclose where the vote count on witnesses stood, and Republican leaders said they didn't yet know what Friday would bring. ""It's going to be very, very close,"" Sen. Mike Braun (R., Ind.) said.
Some Republican senators are suggesting that if they succeed in blocking witnesses on Friday, they will push to end the trial that night, even if that means a vote to acquit Mr. Trump could occur in the wee hours of the morning on Saturday.
Meanwhile, preparing for the possibility of a defeat on the witness vote, Democrats are exploring parliamentary maneuvers that they could use to fight such an abrupt end to the trial and draw attention to what they consider an unfair process.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What are your biggest takeaways from the impeachment Q&A? Why? Join the conversation below.
House Democrats over two days of questioning focused on the need for the chamber to call new witnesses—in particular, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton. On Sunday,
a draft was leaked of Mr. Bolton's forthcoming book
, in which he wrote that Mr. Trump told him he was freezing security aid to Ukraine until it opened investigations into Mr. Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, and other matters.
Mr. Bolton has said
he would testify if subpoenaed
by the Senate. The Republican president has denied Mr. Bolton's account and has called the impeachment case against him a hoax.
Ms. Murkowski, in a question posed to the president's legal team, said the dispute over Mr. Bolton's book ""weighs in favor of calling additional witnesses"" and asked why the Senate shouldn't call Mr. Bolton, suggesting she was leaning toward voting for new testimony.
But later, she and Mr. Alexander signed on to a question asking, Even if the reports of the contents of Mr. Bolton's book were accurate, ""isn't it true that the allegations would still not rise to an impeachable offense?"" The Trump defense team agreed.
Democrats argued witnesses were central to the trial process.
""God forbid we should hear what a relevant witness has to say,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the lead House manager and chairman of the chamber's Intelligence Committee. He proposed limiting witness testimony to one week, responding to concerns from Republicans and some Democrats about prolonging the trial with new testimony and the court battles that could ensue from any new subpoenas. The presidential nomination contests begin on Monday in Iowa.
Democrats have argued that Mr. Trump was trying to cheat in this year's election. Mr. Trump's lawyers tried to turn the tables on Democrats, accusing them of using impeachment to interfere in this year's vote. ""That is the most massive election interference in our history,"" said White House counsel Pat Cipollone, echoing a tweet by Mr. Trump days earlier. ""Let's leave it to the people of the United States.""
Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, on Thursday played down the possibility that Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial, could step in to break a 50-50 tie over calling witnesses. Mr. Schumer said Democrats remain focused on getting to 51 votes. It isn't clear how Mr. Roberts would handle a 50-50 tally, and the Senate rules are silent on the matter.
Thursday's session began on a dramatic note as the chief justice declined to read a question submitted by Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) that included the name of a person identified by some people as the anonymous whistleblower who helped set off the impeachment inquiry. The whistleblower's lawyer hasn't confirmed the person's name.
Mr. Trump's lawyers used Thursday to try to challenge basic elements of Democrats' impeachment case. Deputy White House counsel Pat Philbin argued that on a July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Mr. Trump wasn't asking ""specifically for an investigation"" into Mr. Biden and his son Hunter. A rough transcript of the call released by the White House shows that Mr. Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart to look into the Bidens, saying ""whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.""
Mr. Trump and his allies have alleged that it was corrupt for the elder Mr. Biden during the Obama administration to seek the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had once investigated a Ukrainian gas company where his son sat on the board. Mr. Biden sought the prosecutor's removal as part of a broad international effort to combat corruption in Ukraine. The Bidens have denied any wrongdoing, though Hunter Biden has said it was poor judgment to serve on the Burisma board, which paid him $50,000 a month, while his father was involved with Ukraine policy as vice president.
Mr. Philbin also argued that ""the evidence just doesn't stack up"" to show Mr. Trump linked aid or a White House meeting to Ukraine opening investigations. But he didn't address the possibility of testimony by Mr. Bolton, who, based on his leaked manuscript, could offer such evidence.
Thursday's session also renewed focus on the activities in Ukraine of Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's personal lawyer. In response to a question from a bipartisan group of senators—including two Republicans who have indicated they may vote in favor of new testimony—about whether Mr. Trump could assure the nation he wouldn't direct private citizens such as Mr. Giuliani to carry out foreign policy without a formal designation, Mr. Philbin replied: ""I want to make clear that there was no conduct of foreign policy being carried out here by a private person.""
That is sharply at odds with testimony House investigators heard in the fall. Several witnesses testified that Mr. Trump directed administration officials to work with Mr. Giuliani, who doesn't hold an official position, on resolving his concerns about Ukraine before he would agree to a meeting with the new Ukrainian president. State Department officials periodically reached out to Mr. Giuliani to ensure they were giving the new Ukrainian administration the proper messages to satisfy Mr. Giuliani's concerns.
Mr. Schiff called the assertion ""startling."" He noted that the president's lawyers have argued that critics of Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine objected to his policy, not his conduct. ""They have now acknowledged that the person in charge of this was not conducting policy,"" Mr. Schiff said.
Democrats also tangled with the president's legal team on Thursday over a controversial theory raised a day earlier by Trump lawyer Alan Dershowitz: that because Mr. Trump believes his re-election is in the public interest, even if he had political motivations in pressing Ukraine to open an investigation into the Bidens, it wouldn't be impeachable.
""What we have seen over the last couple days is a descent into constitutional madness,"" Mr. Schiff said.
Mr. Dershowitz wasn't present for Thursday's session. On Twitter, he clarified his remarks, saying a president's lawful behavior couldn't ""be turned into a criminal or impeachable offense just because it was motivated in part by electoral considerations.""

Six Days in the Senate: How Democrats, Trump Team Tried the Impeachment Case

Democratic House managers, acting as prosecutors, are arguing that senators should convict Mr. Trump for abusing his power by withholding nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine as leverage for the country to open investigations that would aid his re-election efforts. The aid was ultimately released under bipartisan pressure from Congress. The House managers also accuse Mr. Trump of trying to cover up his alleged misconduct by obstructing congressional investigations into the matter. Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.
Ms. Collins, along with a handful of other senators, on Thursday asked Democrats whether there were legitimate circumstances under which a president could ask a foreign country to investigate a U.S. citizen—including a political rival—who wasn't under investigation by the U.S.
""It would be hard to contemplate circumstances where that's appropriate,"" Mr. Schiff responded. Mr. Philbin said it was legitimate for the president to ask for a foreign investigation into a matter where a U.S. citizen broke the law abroad.

For many voters going to the polls Tuesday in three states, the trip was their first time out of their homes since they started practicing social distancing to deal with
the coronavirus pandemic
.
Some were successful in casting their ballots—with hand sanitizer at the ready, while others had trouble even locating an operating polling site.
Mike Kontos, a 37-year-old real-estate agent who cast his ballot at a fire station in Miami, voted for former Vice President Joe Biden with gloves and disinfectant wipes he brought with him after being cooped up at home for several days. He said Mr. Biden could be boosted by the Trump administration's handling of the coronavirus outbreak.
""If he plays it right, he could have a good chance,"" Mr. Kontos said, as voters trickled into the polling site with no lines.
While at least five states
have postponed their primaries
because of the pandemic, voters in Florida, Illinois and Arizona headed to the polls Tuesday, with many counties reporting a low turnout for in-person voting. Ohio's primary had also been scheduled for Tuesday, but the governor postponed in-person voting there and
polling places were closed
.
The Democratic presidential primary field has narrowed in recent weeks to just Mr. Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and polls in all three states have shown Mr. Biden with a lead.
Stephen Watson, 53, a health-care executive who also voted in Miami, said his trip to the polling station was his first outing after self-quarantining for two weeks because of symptoms he said were consistent with Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus: a temperature of 103 degrees, cough and shortness of breath. He said he wasn't able to confirm he had the virus because he couldn't get tested.
Mr. Watson also voted for Mr. Biden. ""We don't need a revolution,"" he said,
echoing one of Mr. Biden's lines about Mr. Sanders
. ""We just need good leadership.""
In Illinois, there were widespread reports of voters not being able to cast their ballots after polling places closed when election judges didn't show up. Some found handwritten signs telling them the polling site had closed and posted photos on social media.
Election organizers were scrambling to find new polling-place workers in Chicago and suburban counties after hundreds dropped out over concerns about the virus.
Matthew Lindner, 38, who works in marketing in Chicago, said his polling site was moved from a senior citizens home to a church in his neighborhood, with no communication from election officials about the change. A sign at the senior citizens home and the election website confirmed the new location.
But when he got to the church to vote at 8 a.m., poll workers told him that voting machines hadn't made it to the site yet.
""I'm livid with the state,"" he said. ""This is not the first election we've had in Chicago. I think it's 100% related to the pandemic. I've never seen anything like this.""
Mr. Lindner returned to the polling site about five hours later to cast his ballot. The equipment had arrived less than an hour before, and about a dozen people were in line—spaced out about two feet apart. There was no hand sanitizer in sight.
When he reached the front of the line, he and some others were told their precinct had been moved again—to a local library.
LaDonna Miller, 26, a clinical counselor in Chicago, voted early for Mr. Sanders on Monday after hearing about officials still trying to find enough election workers for Tuesday. ""They said there was a shortage of judges,"" she said. ""I had a fear of my polling place being properly staffed.""
Ms. Miller said she waited for two hours in a line with other voters and grew concerned about the conditions they faced. ""We were very clustered together and not following any of the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's] guidelines,"" she said.
Christina Cosentino, 28, a graduate student in Joliet, Ill., said she decided to mail in her ballot for Mr. Biden instead of going to the polls during the outbreak. ""Actually,"" she said. ""I only know a few people who voted today.""

New York officials are debating whether to move the state's Democratic presidential primary from April 28 to a date in June as the number of coronavirus infections grows.
State Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat from Orange County, introduced a bill that would move the nominating contest to June 23, which is already the date of primary elections for members of Congress as well as the state Assembly and Senate.
State health officials project the outbreak will reach its peak in around 45 days. Mr. Skoufis said he was concerned about the possibility of the virus spreading at polling places and said consolidating elections would save taxpayer money.
""Joe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee, so there's no responsible reason why we should continue on with an April primary,"" said Mr. Skoufis, who had endorsed Pete Buttigieg's candidacy.
The April 28 elections were shaping up to be Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders's last stand against the former vice president. Mr. Biden has amassed 1,181 delegates, compared with Mr. Sanders's 885.
Good-government advocacy groups including Citizens Union and Common Cause NY also support the postponement.
Republicans canceled their presidential primary after President Trump was the only candidate who submitted the required nominating signatures. Douglas Kellner, a Democratic commissioner of the State Board of Elections, said moving the presidential primary would be up to the state Legislature and Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Mr. Kellner supports the idea.
""I think that the date is arbitrary and the risks to the public outweigh the relative importance of keeping our democratic functions operational,"" he said.
Mr. Cuomo said Sunday that he was exploring ways to make it easier for people to vote by mail in the primary. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio last week postponed a March 24 special election for Queens borough president because of the outbreak. Spokesmen for Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, both Democrats, didn't respond to a request for comment.
April 28 had become the so-called ""Acela Primary"" because voting was also scheduled in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland and Rhode Island -- all of which are serviced by Amtrak's express train. The governors of Maryland and Connecticut already delayed their contests until June 2, and officials in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island are also considering changes.
New York State Democratic Chairman Jay Jacobs said he believes it is premature to reschedule the primary. Mr. Jacobs said voting on June 28 would cause logistical problems: It will take officials around 10 days to certify the results, and the party's state committee must hold a meeting to name at-large delegates before the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, which starts on July 13.
""At the moment, I choose to be optimistic and look at reports that show it might be abating by the date of our primary,"" Mr. Jacobs said of the coronavirus outbreak.
The Democratic National Committee has rules in place that could reduce the number of convention delegates awarded to a state if it holds a primary after June 9. Mr. Jacobs said he was confident the DNC would reconsider its regulations in light of the outbreak; a DNC spokeswoman didn't respond to an email seeking comment.
There are also special elections on April 28 for a congressional seat in western New York, a state Senate seat around Syracuse and three Assembly seats. Political strategists said the virus has already prompted campaigns to focus their efforts online as door-to-door canvassing has been curtailed to prevent the spread of the virus.

CLINTON, Iowa -- Before President Trump, no American president had ever sought re-election in the middle of an impeachment.
Former Vice President Joe Biden is contending with a similar distinction in the Democratic primaries, as a White House candidate caught up in the impeachment of Mr. Trump, whose trial centers on his pressing Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden, a possible opponent in this year's election.
Days before the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Biden is trying to turn Republican efforts to damage him in the impeachment trial into a badge of honor and a sign of his resilience. His campaign hopes it will help him appeal to Democratic voters struggling to answer the contest's biggest question: Which Democrat is best positioned to defeat Mr. Trump in November's general election?
""This whole impeachment trial for Trump is just a political hit job to smear me,"" Mr. Biden told an audience Tuesday night in Clinton, a community along the Mississippi River. ""That's how scared Trump is about having to run against me.""
When Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst suggested the Senate's trial in Washington could undercut Mr. Biden's appeal in Iowa, his campaign quickly seized upon her comments and posted a digital ad.
Mr. Trump's lawyers argued this week that the president was justified in seeking investigations into Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who served on the board of the Ukrainian natural-gas company Burisma while Mr. Biden was vice president. Mr. Biden has said he did nothing wrong in pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who had at one time been involved in investigating Burisma and who was widely viewed as insufficiently aggressive on corruption. Mr. Biden has also noted he was carrying out the Obama administration's Ukraine policy, which was in line with international partners on rooting out corruption.
Mr. Biden rarely hears questions from voters about the impeachment trial. But the uncertainty over how long it will last has loomed over the final week in Iowa.
Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar have been forced to scrap most of their Iowa campaign schedules to attend the trial.
The possibility of testimony at the impeachment trial from witnesses, such as former national security adviser John Bolton, could mean the proceeding spills over into campaigning ahead of the Feb. 11 New Hampshire primary.
It also could increase the likelihood that Mr. Biden's son, or even Mr. Biden himself, might be called to testify.
He told reporters this week that he had ""nothing to defend. This is all a game.""
Republicans, meanwhile, haven't been subtle about trying to use the trial to undermine Mr. Biden's candidacy.
Ms. Ernst, who is seeking re-election this year, told reporters that she was ""really interested"" to see how the arguments made by Mr. Trump's legal team ""informs and influences the Iowa caucus voters.""
Mr. Biden pounced, reading aloud the senator's comments during his events in Iowa. The campaign placed a homemade sign on the wall that said, ""Joni -- We're w/ Joe.""
""She spilled the beans,"" said Mr. Biden, who told his supporters, ""You can ruin Donald Trump's night by caucusing for me, but also you can ruin Joni Ernst's night.""
One of Ms. Ernst's Senate colleagues, meanwhile, bought airtime in Iowa to bolster Mr. Trump's defense. Sen. Rick Scott (R., Fla.) cut a 30-second ad accusing Mr. Biden of getting away with a pressure campaign against Ukraine and helping his son profit from his position, charges the Bidens and supporters have denied.
""I just see that as part of the desperation of the Republicans in facing him, that they've got to try to drag him and his son into this,"" said Jeff Hermiston, a retired teacher from West Liberty, Iowa, who saw Mr. Biden at a recent event and plans to caucus for him.

WASHINGTON—An emboldened President Trump turned his focus Sunday to his re-election bid, arguing a growing economy would help him in November, as Democrats' lead impeachment manager vowed to press for the president's removal even as the Senate is virtually certain to acquit him.
""It was all nonsense,"" Mr. Trump said of impeachment during a Fox News interview. ""It's a very serious thing. It should never happen to another president.""
In a separate television appearance, Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) said that in closing arguments in the impeachment trial Monday, Democrats would continue pressing to remove Mr. Trump from office over his Ukraine pressure campaign.
""It's enormously important that the country understand exactly what this president did,"" Mr. Schiff said. The Senate should remove Mr. Trump from office, Mr. Schiff said, ""because he is threatening to still cheat in the next election by soliciting foreign interference.""
The televised comments by Messrs. Trump and Schiff came just ahead of the Iowa caucuses Monday, the State of the Union address Tuesday and the expected acquittal of Mr. Trump by Senate Republicans on Wednesday. They also came as
new polling showed voters' views of him
were little-changed by his impeachment.
In Iowa, site of the nation's first presidential nominating contest, Democratic contenders were crisscrossing the state trying to appeal to the many voters who have said they would make their choice based on who they think has the best chance to unseat the Republican president in November.
""I just want Trump out,"" said Sandy Suplee, a 58-year-old laborer from Pella, Iowa. She said she would set aside her personal preferences among the candidates to support former Vice President Joe Biden, whom she believes has the best odds of winning.
For Trump supporter Susan Ohnysty, a 60-year-old in West Des Moines, impeachment was a ""waste of time,"" adding that the articles of impeachment ""were not meeting the standards of a high crime.""
On Friday,
the Senate voted 51-49
to reject Democrats' demands to call new witnesses in the impeachment trial. That
effectively ended the impeachment effort,
even though the trial is set to resume for four hours of closing arguments Monday, followed by a vote on the articles of impeachment Wednesday.
A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found a majority of voters said they believed Mr. Trump abused his power by asking Ukraine to investigate a potential political opponent in order to influence the coming election, and also that Mr. Trump obstructed Congress by not cooperating with the impeachment inquiry.
But there wasn't majority support for removing him from office. The poll found 49% said he should be allowed to finish his term, compared with 46% who said he should be removed.
Mr. Trump's job approval in the January poll stood at 46%, with 51% disapproving, in line with results throughout the Trump presidency.
Mr. Schiff, when pressed in an interview on CBS on what Democrats would do after Mr. Trump's likely acquittal, said he wasn't looking beyond the trial.
""I'm not letting the senators off the hook,"" Mr. Schiff said. ""We're still going to go into the Senate this week and make the case why this president needs to be removed.""
Asked if Democrats would consider subpoenaing former national security adviser John Bolton—
whose coming book alleges
that the president told him he wanted to hold up aid to Ukraine until he got the investigations he wanted—Mr. Schiff declined to answer definitively but said there are several possible options.
In a separate television appearance on Sunday, one of the president's attorneys in the Senate trial, Alan Dershowitz, argued that there is no need to seek out new information.
""The articles of impeachment did not charge an impeachable offense,"" Mr. Dershowitz said on Fox News. ""So the right answer is to dismiss it and cut it off right there. No amount of witnesses could have changed that conclusion.""
Mr. Dershowitz also reframed one of his arguments last week, about whether Mr. Trump could have believed his re-election was in the national interest.
""If the president did something completely lawful, the fact that part of his motivation may have been to help his election cannot be the quid pro quo,"" he said. ""I don't believe that a president can do anything if he thinks it is in the national interest.""
The Senate impeachment trial commanded 11 days of attention and appeared to be heading for a final vote Saturday. But a decision to break until a resumption this week was bipartisan, Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.) said.
That gave Democratic senators campaigning for president a chance to hit the trail in Iowa, while others got a chance to relax.
Sen. Lindsey Graham headed home to South Carolina, where a pulled pork platter awaited him. ""We all need a break,"" Mr. Graham, a Republican, said. ""This is as close to purgatory as any of us want to get.""
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democratic presidential hopeful, missed a scheduled campaign appearance at a Friday evening town hall in Des Moines, leaving her campaign co-leaders to hold down the fort.
However, the Senate trial adjourned in enough time for Ms. Warren to show up at a hastily arranged late-night campaign event at a brewery across the street from the town-hall venue.
Some in the White House saw an upside to the timing, with Mr. Trump giving his State of the Union address before his likely acquittal. Eric Ueland, the White House legislative liaison, told reporters it would bring focus to what he said were Mr. Trump's accomplishments while contrasting with the various investigations into the president.
""It's a strong one-two punch,"" he said.

ALLENDALE, S.C.—If South Carolina is former Vice President Joe Biden's firewall against Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential primary race, interviews with black voters here indicate some cracks have formed.
Most of nearly two dozen likely voters who discussed their plans for Saturday's primary said they were trying to decide between Mr. Biden, who has long benefited from strong support from African-Americans, and billionaire Tom Steyer, who has campaigned heavily in the state.
Allendale County, tucked along the Georgia border away from the cities candidates typically focus on, carries symbolic weight in the first 2020 primary where black voters will play a significant role: It has the state's highest proportion of nonwhite voters, a Wall Street Journal analysis of state data found.
""I feel very strongly about Joe Biden, but he's making me nervous right now,"" said Lottie Lewis, a town council member here. Besides Mr. Biden, she is considering Mr. Steyer and planned to meet this week with some of his representatives.
More than three-quarters of Allendale County's roughly 5,800 registered voters are nonwhite, and U.S. census data indicates 73.8% of the county's residents are black. South Carolina's Democratic primary electorate was 61% black in 2016, exit polls showed
South Carolina's black vote isn't concentrated only in urban areas, as is the case in some other parts of the U.S. Twelve of the state's 46 counties have registered-voter populations that are more than half nonwhite, making the rural vote important in the primary.
Polling averages in the state show Mr. Biden leading, followed by Mr. Sanders and Mr. Steyer.
South Carolina is critical for Mr. Biden. He has decadeslong ties to the state and needs a win to brighten his campaign narrative after poor showings in nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire and a second-place finish in Nevada. His once-dominant lead in South Carolina polls has narrowed, and Mr. Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist from Vermont, has intensified his campaign in the state this week.
In
Tuesday night's debate in Charleston
, Mr. Biden showed no hesitation when asked whether he would win Saturday. ""I will win South Carolina,"" he said. On Wednesday,
Mr. Biden secured the important endorsement
of Rep. James Clyburn, the most influential Democrat in the state.
But Mr. Sanders has momentum after victories in Nevada and New Hampshire and a split decision in Iowa with Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind. Only one voter interviewed here mentioned Mr. Buttigieg as someone they were thinking about backing on Saturday.
Mr. Buttigieg was among the few candidates who visited Allendale County, which is an hour or more from the state's major population centers. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, who is no longer in the race, is the only other to make a stop here so far,
according to a tracker run by The Post and Courier newspaper
in Charleston.
In recent weeks, Mr. Steyer has largely had South Carolina to himself. Most of the other candidates focused more on Nevada, New Hampshire and some of the 14 states that host contests March 3. Mr. Steyer has spent more in the state on advertising than any other 2020 candidate, at $22.4 million, according to data from advertising tracker Kantar/CMAG.
Nate Hartley, a retired information technology manager who remains undecided, said he was intrigued. ""Tom Steyer has hit really hard here,"" he said. ""Every week, I get some kind of contact from him.""
Mr. Hartley said he didn't see Mr. Biden ""pulling back up from where he is"" in the race and thought Mr. Sanders was too progressive. ""Bernie wants to end capitalism,"" he said.
Patricia Johnson, a retired elementary school teacher, said she already had voted via an absentee ballot for Mr. Steyer. She said she did so, in part, because of Mr. Steyer's wealth and his potential ability to compete against President Trump in a general election. ""We all know money talks,"" she said. ""He could match Trump dollar for dollar on advertising.""
Ms. Johnson said she liked Mr. Biden but was concerned about his association with Mr. Trump's impeachment over, in part, his pressing Ukraine to investigate the former vice president's family. Mr. Trump wanted a probe into Mr. Biden's oldest son, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian company at a time when his father was pushing anticorruption efforts there. The Bidens have denied wrongdoing.
""If he's the nominee, there would be so much drama involving Ukraine with him and Trump,"" Ms. Johnson said. ""I've had enough drama.""
In an interview, Mr. Steyer said he thought he was in second or third place in South Carolina and ""moving up."" He attributed his success with black voters to his focus on racial issues and spending more time in South Carolina than ""any other"" candidate.
""I deal explicitly with race,"" he said. ""I have a decadeslong history of working with people in the African-American community and Latino community, and actually taking part when it had nothing to do with me running for president.""
Allendale, the county seat, has seen better days. Before Interstate 95 was built in the 1960s to the east, it was a booming town along a north-south highway that moved commerce and tourists between the Northeast and Florida. It is now mostly dependent on agriculture, timber and government employment. Almost a third of residents live in poverty, double the state average.
One recent development that has brought smiles to many here was the Super Bowl win of the Kansas City Chiefs. Cornerback Bashaud Breeland attended the town's high school.

Wilbur Cave, the executive director of a housing nonprofit, said he was undecided about his vote. Mr. Steyer's commitment to the state had impressed him. ""I like that he put a lot of energy and time and resources into South Carolina,"" he said.
Pam Love, an attendance clerk at an elementary school, said she was also leaning toward supporting Mr. Steyer after seeing him speak last weekend in a neighboring county. ""I like how he reaches out to the minority community,"" she said.
Clifford Smith, a pig farmer, said he was originally a supporter of Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts before switching to Mr. Biden. He is concerned, however, about the former vice president's lackluster performance on the campaign trail. ""I don't know what his problem is,"" he said. ""It was his to lose and he's losing it.""

Joe Biden triumphed in the key state of Michigan, while also winning in Missouri, Mississippi and Idaho, as he built his delegate lead over Bernie Sanders with a coalition of African-Americans, suburbanites and older voters in Tuesday's round of Democratic presidential nominating contests.
Opening a new phase in the race, the former vice president put distance between himself and Mr. Sanders—and built upon his momentum from
wins in 10 Super Tuesday states
last week. Mr. Biden quickly sought to unite the party after prevailing in Michigan, which offered 125 delegates, the biggest prize of the night. Mr. Sanders won the North Dakota caucuses, while the results in Washington, the second-biggest delegate haul of the day, were too close to call.
""I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion,"" Mr. Biden said in remarks at Philadelphia's National Constitution Center. ""We share a common goal and, together, we'll defeat Donald Trump; we'll defeat him together.""
Mr. Biden has presented himself as the Democrat best able to challenge President Trump in general election battlegrounds such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, which was the first of those states to weigh in on the Democratic race. His win there, by one measure, is his most significant yet and could allow him to argue that he should be the party's nominee. With about 64% of precincts reporting, Mr. Biden had about 53% of the vote to about 38% for Mr. Sanders. The Vermont senator narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton in the state in the 2016 nominating contest.
Mr. Biden was projected the winner in Mississippi, Missouri and Michigan shortly after the states' polls closed, an early sign of his clout in three states with large African-American voting blocs. Black voters made up about two-thirds of the electorate in Mississippi, exit polls showed. Mr. Biden had won more than 80% of support in the state, with about 89% of precincts reporting.
The former vice president campaigned ahead of the Missouri primary among African-Americans in St. Louis and Kansas City. With about 93% of precincts reporting, Mr. Biden had about 60% of the vote in Missouri.
Mr. Sanders returned to his home in Burlington, Vt., and did not speak publicly after the election results. A campaign aide said he intended to participate in Sunday's debate in Phoenix.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a top Sanders surrogate, expressed disappointment as the election results streamed in. ""There's no sugar-coating it. Tonight's a tough night. Tonight's a tough night for the movement overall,"" Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said on Instagram.
Mr. Biden entered Tuesday with a delegate edge of 670 to 574 over Mr. Sanders, according to
a Wall Street Journal delegate tracker
, even as Super Tuesday states such as California and Colorado, which Mr. Sanders carried, continue to process election results.
Mr. Sanders sought to steady his campaign on Tuesday. Moderates in the Democratic Party rapidly
coalesced around Mr. Biden
after he won South Carolina's primary last month. Some in the party's establishment have expressed fears that Mr. Sanders, a self-described Democratic socialist who won the New Hampshire and Nevada contests, would be too liberal for many voters in the general election.
The campaigns competed for votes against the backdrop of
growing economic concerns
over
the spread of the coronavirus
. Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden both canceled rallies in Cleveland Tuesday, ahead of Ohio's primary next week, citing public health concerns. Both candidates have
questioned Mr. Trump's handling of the crisis
in recent days.
Exit polls coming in with the results showed Mr. Biden winning handily among black and older voters and performing well with those who had at least a college degree. Mr. Biden was also prevailing in cities such as St. Louis, Kansas City and Detroit and in their surrounding suburban areas—including Oakland County, Mich., a key general election battleground.
Mr. Sanders maintained a substantial advantage over Mr. Biden among young voters, exit polls showed. The Vermont senator staked much of his campaign on motivating the young, and others disenchanted with current politics, to come to the polls.
Mr. Biden, while campaigning in Michigan, spoke of the Obama administration's bailout of General Motors and Chrysler, two titans of the state's auto industry, more than a decade ago.
""We bet on you,"" Mr. Biden said during a visit to a Fiat Chrysler assembly plant in Detroit earlier Tuesday. ""If I end up being the president, you'll never have a better friend in the White House.""
During a Detroit rally on the eve of the primary, Mr. Biden was joined by California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, two former presidential rivals who recently endorsed Mr. Biden's candidacy. The pair—who have been discussed by some Democrats as potential running mates for Mr. Biden if he wins the nomination—sought to help him appeal to black voters in the state.
Mr. Sanders courted voters at a Dearborn Heights, Mich., polling place on Tuesday, repeating criticisms he has raised about Mr. Biden's record, including the former Delaware senator's past support for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Mr. Sanders told reporters that was ""obviously a very important state"" but that he thinks every state is important to try to win. Last week, his campaign dispatched top aides to Michigan, including some who oversaw his Iowa caucus efforts.
""When our record is compared to Biden's, when our vision is compared to Biden's, when we have that debate in Phoenix, I'm feeling pretty good,"" Mr. Sanders said, referring to Sunday's
primary debate in Arizona
.
Tuesday's nominating contest served as the first opportunity for voters to consider a one-on-one choice between Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii) was still seeking the nomination but has been unable to break out of single-digit polling.
Mr. Biden has largely sought to avoid confrontation with Mr. Sanders as he attempts to build support in the party.
The former vice president mostly has only mentioned his opponent to point out that he himself has driven up turnout in primaries so far, not Mr. Sanders. Mr. Biden has argued that he is bringing African-Americans and white blue-collar workers into his coalition.
""Sen. Sanders likes to say, 'We need a record turnout to beat Donald Trump.' He's absolutely right,"" Mr. Biden has told audiences in recent days, rattling off statistics from Super Tuesday showing a turnout boost in states such as Virginia, Texas and North Carolina.
""Guess who they voted for? They voted for us,"" Mr. Biden said.

LAS VEGAS—Democratic presidential candidates said Sunday that the U.S. faces an urgent need to rebuild the nation's roads, bridges and highways, appealing to union workers ahead of Nevada's Feb. 22 caucuses.
Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Tom Steyer courted several labor unions
Sunday at a forum
sponsored by United for Infrastructure, a nonprofit organization made up of labor unions and trade associations.
The candidates said upgrading the country's aging transportation system has been a promise that President Trump failed to keep during his first term and that their own infrastructure plans could serve as a counterweight to his re-election message.
During his presidency, Mr. Trump has sought $1 trillion in infrastructure improvements. Democrats have noted that his plan would press cities and states to provide at least 80% of the funding.
""Do you remember one of the things that he promised? Infrastructure,"" said Ms. Klobuchar, a Minnesota senator, recalling the president's victory speech after the 2016 election. ""While Congress has kept the funding going in some of the areas, we have not seen the big infrastructure investment that he promised—not one that keeps our country competitive.""

Mr. Biden, the former vice president, said the country could simultaneously fix the nation's crumbling infrastructure while ensuring it was improved to become more resilient to climate change. ""I think you do both,"" he said. One of his proposals includes adding 500,000 charging stations for electric vehicles.
""I believe the Band-Aid has been ripped off and people are ready to do rational things,"" Mr. Biden said, describing a Congress in which both parties might be ready to reach a deal on infrastructure.
The candidates have offered plans to overhaul the nation's transportation network and create construction jobs, intended in part to draw a contrast with the president, whose proposals have languished despite bipartisan attempts in Congress to forge a broad plan
to repair the country's infrastructure.

Organized labor has long been a political force in Nevada and plays a more significant role in the state than in Iowa and New Hampshire, which held the first two presidential nominating contests.
Mr. Biden has proposed
a $1.3 trillion plan
to rebuild roads, bridges and highways and promote a high-speed rail system. Ms. Klobuchar, who made infrastructure the subject of the first policy rollout of her campaign, would spend $1 trillion on the projects, including $650 billion in direct federal funding for infrastructure.
Mr. Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Ind., has outlined a program to put $1 trillion into infrastructure in partnership with states and cities, a plan that he says would create 6 million jobs. Mr. Steyer, meanwhile, has proposed dedicating $2 trillion in public spending to promote ""climate-smart"" infrastructure.
The plans have also been at the center of how the candidates intend to address climate change.
Mr. Steyer, a billionaire businessman, said that if elected he would declare a climate emergency on his first day in office, and infrastructure spending would work in tandem with his climate-change agenda.
""Everything we're going to do we're going to do from the standpoint of climate,"" he said.
Mr. Buttigieg, who recently finished his second term as mayor, pointed to the frustration that many municipal leaders had after Mr. Trump released his infrastructure proposal. He said it would have had many state and local officials ""do most of the work and come up with most of the money.""
Mr. Buttigieg said the nation had ""an opportunity to do something different and take the 'Infrastructure week' back from being a punchline and actually make sure it is a template for a better future."" He was referring to weeks in which the administration said it planned to push lawmakers to come to terms on legislation, efforts that were sometimes overshadowed by other topics raised by the president.

The Democratic candidates proposing infrastructure upgrades said they would pay for them largely by undoing Mr. Trump's tax cuts for businesses, along with a variety of other steps.
One funding issue the next administration may be confronted with is how to replenish the Highway Trust Fund, which gets its revenue from federal fuels taxes. The trust fund has faced a shortfall because fuel taxes haven't been raised in a quarter-century while increased vehicle efficiency has cut into gasoline and diesel consumption.
But the candidates said it was unlikely that Congress would approve a gas-tax increase. Mr. Biden, for example, said he would devote $50 billion from the higher taxes on corporations to bolster the trust fund but said flatly, ""We're not going to be able to raise the gas tax."" He did, however, say that Congress might be able to index the tax for inflation.
The forum Sunday, at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, was moderated by The Wall Street Journal's Gerald Seib and Jeanne Cummings.
The forum was a showcase for the candidates before organized labor.
The most powerful union in Nevada, Culinary 226, which represents about 60,000 members from the hospitality industry, said Friday it
wouldn't endorse a presidential candidate
before the caucuses.
Most of the nation's largest labor unions have stayed on the sidelines in the 2020 primaries, but some labor organizations have signaled plans to become more active.
The candidates said they would honor prevailing wage laws, including the Davis-Bacon law, which they said would ensure that workers receive fair wages. They also vowed to prevent corporations from taking over federal apprenticeship programs, a key concern for building trades and other unions.
The leading Democratic presidential contenders, along with Mr. Trump, were invited to participate in the forum. On the Democratic side, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren chose not to attend.
The event's host committee included: International Union of Operating Engineers; Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO; North America's Building Trades Unions; Transport Workers Union of America; American Society of Civil Engineers; American Public Transportation Association; American Council of Engineering Companies; American Road and Transportation Builders Association; Value of Water Campaign; Association of Equipment Manufacturers; Airports Council International-North America; and Build Together.

WASHINGTON—The Republican-led Senate acquitted President Trump of charges stemming from his efforts to
press Ukraine to announce investigations
that would benefit him politically, bringing to a close a bruising four-month battle fought almost entirely along party lines.
The
third presidential impeachment in U.S. history
intensified the nation's sharp divide over Mr. Trump and previewed many of the arguments likely to be heard ahead of the election this fall. During the trial, Democrats said the Republican president was trying to cheat in the coming election by trying to damage a potential opponent. Republicans said that Democrats were improperly inflating missteps into impeachable offenses and trying to overturn the results of the 2016 election.
The Senate vote to acquit marked a clear victory for the president, underscoring his primacy in the GOP and the end to a process that had hung over the past several months of his presidency. But while Mr. Trump had hoped for a forceful display of unity from Republicans in defense of his actions, he got something less: GOP senators strongly supported his acquittal, but several said the Democrats had proven that he acted improperly—though not in a manner deserving of impeachment—regarding Ukraine.
Mr. Trump was also denied a unanimous not guilty verdict from Republican senators when
Mitt Romney of Utah voted to convict
on the first article of impeachment.
Given the GOP's 53-47 majority in the Senate and the Constitution's requirement that two-thirds of the Senate is required to convict, Mr. Trump's chance of acquittal was always strong. Mr. Trump now becomes the first president to run for re-election after having been impeached.
Mr. Trump and his campaign sought throughout the process to turn impeachment to his political advantage, frequently using his attacks on the investigation in fundraising emails.
On the first article of impeachment, abuse of power, all 47 Democratic-aligned senators and Mr. Romney voted to convict, falling short of the 67 needed to remove the president from office. On the obstruction of Congress article, the vote also failed, with all Democrats and no Republicans finding the president guilty.
The senators read their votes aloud from their desks, and Chief Justice John Roberts announced the outcome. ""Donald John Trump, president of the United States…is hereby acquitted,"" he said.
Mr. Trump, in a tweet after the vote, declared ""our Country's VICTORY on the Impeachment Hoax"" and wrote that he would make a public statement about his acquittal on Thursday.
Republicans' arguments in favor of acquittal split broadly into two camps. Some argued that House impeachment managers' case was half-baked and that they should have gone to court to pursue the testimony of further witnesses who had been told by the White House not to cooperate. Others in the party said House Democrats had proved their case but that the president's conduct wasn't impeachable.
The impeachment probe grew out of a phone call last summer in which Mr. Trump asked President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to announce an investigation into Joe Biden, a top Democratic presidential contender, while holding up congressionally approved aid to the country. Mr. Trump has defended the call as ""perfect"" and has said he did nothing wrong regarding Ukraine. The aid was later released after bipartisan outcry from lawmakers.
The most dramatic moment of the day came two hours before the acquittal vote, when Mr. Romney said in a floor speech that he had decided to vote to convict the president on the first article. ""The president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust,"" he said.
Mr. Romney was the first senator in U.S. history to vote to convict a president of his own party. In the impeachment trials of Democratic presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, no Democratic senators voted to convict.
The White House, which as late as Wednesday morning had been predicting that all Republican senators would vote to acquit the president, was caught off-guard by Mr. Romney's announcement, aides said.
Immediately after Mr. Romney announced his vote, White House aides began planning to intensify attacks on the Utah senator. Later that evening, Mr. Trump tweeted a video accusing Mr. Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, of ""posing as a Republican"" and trying to ""infiltrate"" the Trump administration.
The White House had also held out hope that a handful of Democrats would side with Republicans and vote to acquit the president, but Democrats remained unified.
Democrats said the acquittal amounted to a defeat for the institution of Congress, and they warned that leaving Mr. Trump in office would make him free to abuse power again.
""The verdict of this kangaroo court will be meaningless,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, on Wednesday. ""You cannot be on the side of this president and be on the side of truth.""
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How do you think President Trump's acquittal will affect his bid for 2020, if at all? Join the conversation below.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Democrats used impeachment for political goals. ""We should all agree that this is the precisely the type of recklessness that the Senate was created to stop,"" he said on the floor. ""The response to losing one election cannot be to attack the office of the presidency.""
In a news conference later in the day, Mr. McConnell declined to answer questions about whether he found the president's conduct appropriate.
In the months after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) opened the inquiry in September, the Democratic-led House called 17 witnesses and hundreds of documents to build its case, formally
impeaching the president in December
. A month later, it handed the articles over to the Senate, which heard arguments from House impeachment managers and Mr. Trump's defense team but rejected calling witnesses it said the House should have pursued.
The tightly choreographed Senate trial was upended late last month by new revelations from former national security adviser John Bolton about the president's pressure campaign on Ukraine. The former official's
revelations in a yet-unpublished memoir
briefly raised the possibility a sufficient number of Republicans would join with Democrats to vote in favor of new witness testimony. But Republicans ultimately voted nearly in unison to oppose hearing from Mr. Bolton and other witnesses.
""Unless there's some bipartisan consensus of treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors, as there was in the Nixon case, then there shouldn't be an impeachment,"" Sen. Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.) said on Tuesday.
While a majority of voters in a recent
Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll
said they believed Mr. Trump abused his power and obstructed Congress, some 49% of respondents said he should be allowed to finish his term, compared with 46% who said he should be removed.
Impeachment also made little impact on Mr. Trump's job-approval rating, which stood at 46% in the January poll—in line with his rating throughout his presidency.
Democrats made clear the trial settled nothing for them, with members of House leadership saying they would likely continue to investigate. A top House Democrat, Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, said Wednesday the House would ""likely"" subpoena Mr. Bolton and continue the investigation. Mr. Bolton's spokeswoman declined to comment on whether he would comply with any subpoena.
Despite his public attacks on the impeachment process, Mr. Trump stayed—at Mr. McConnell's urging—largely on the sidelines of Republican efforts to rally lawmakers against voting for new witnesses and approached his own legal team with a fairly light touch.
The president's sole recommendation to his team came after the defense's first day of arguments, an administration official said. After his lawyers argued for two hours, he called with a request: put Pam Bondi on TV more. He told the team he wanted Ms. Bondi, the former Florida attorney general who joined the White House last fall as an adviser on impeachment, to continue arguing his case on TV in the evenings.
Instead, Mr. Trump focused his attention elsewhere. As the trial unfolded last week, White House officials huddled with GOP House members and their aides in a small room in the vice president's office in the Capitol that one GOP aide described as ""mission control."" The president, the aide said, insisted advisers not call it a ""war room,"" which he said wrongly suggested Republicans were embattled and that impeachment was an actual crisis.

WASHINGTON—Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said Thursday that the nation needs to harness a comprehensive public-health and economic response to the coronavirus, offering a look at how he would address a crisis in the White House.
The former vice president, in a speech near his home in Wilmington, Del., said the nation must respond aggressively to combat the spread of the disease, with practices and staff he described as grounded in science.
He said President Trump's labeling of the outbreak as a ""foreign virus"" during a Wednesday night Oval Office address ""does not displace accountability for the misjudgments that have been taken thus far by the Trump administration.""
""Let me be crystal clear, the coronavirus does not have a political affiliation,"" Mr. Biden said. ""It will infect Republicans, independents and Democrats alike.""
The former vice president outlined a new plan to fight the virus, saying the U.S. should lead a coordinated, global response that prepares hospitals and public-health workers and responds to the economic fallout. ""President Trump is welcome to adopt all of it today,"" he said.
Mr. Trump's campaign said in response that the president had ""acted early and decisively"" to fight the virus, and he had put the U.S. ""on stronger footing than other nations.""
""His every move has been aimed at keeping Americans safe, while Joe Biden has sought to capitalize politically and stoke citizens' fears,"" Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's communications director, said.
The image of Mr. Biden standing before a backdrop of American flags in a conference room at the Hotel DuPont aimed to project steadiness and serve as a counterweight to Mr. Trump, who has been accused by Democrats of providing a halting response to the outbreak.
It came as the coronavirus has forced the presidential campaigns of Mr. Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Mr. Trump to curtail their public activities. Mr. Biden canceled events in Ohio, Florida and Illinois this week; the campaign is planning ""virtual"" events in Chicago and Miami in coming days.
Mr. Biden's campaign said in an internal memo Thursday that all staff at its Philadelphia headquarters and around the country would work from home beginning Saturday. The campaign will continue to hold smaller events such as round-tables and house parties, but all fundraisers ""will become virtual fundraisers indefinitely.""
Mr. Sanders also addressed the pandemic in a speech in Burlington, Vt., using it to highlight Medicare for All, one of his signature policies. He said even without a single-payer health-care system, the government needed to provide care at no cost.
Mr. Trump, meanwhile, canceled a trip to Colorado and Nevada, including an appearance at a Republican Jewish Coalition event in Las Vegas. That event has since been postponed.
The campaign said Thursday night that staff had been instructed to work remotely through Monday so that the office could undergo a deep cleaning. An official described the move as precautionary.
The president has publicly and privately chafed at postponing rallies and had largely defended continuing them as the virus escalated. The campaign had recently been looking at holding a rally in Tampa, but hadn't announced any plans as some allies grew concerned that Mr. Trump should put the activity on pause.
Speaking to reporters Thursday, Mr. Trump said the campaign had been looking at ""four or five"" rallies, adding that the never-announced event in Tampa was ""all sold out.""
""I think we'll probably not do it, because people would say it's better to not do. You know, we need a little separation until such time as this goes away,"" Mr. Trump said. ""It's going to go away. It's going to go away.""
Mr. Biden's speech came at a pivot point for his campaign as it readies for a likely general election battle against the president. Mr. Biden on Thursday installed Jennifer O'Malley Dillon,
a top former Obama campaign aide, as his new campaign manager
, succeeding Greg Schultz, who will focus on planning for the general election.
Mr. Biden's remarks effectively were a response to the Oval Office address of Mr. Trump, who announced a 30-day ban on most travel from Europe to the U.S.
The former vice president said Americans should have access to free testing for the virus, especially the elderly living in nursing homes, and said the nation needed to swiftly develop a vaccine for coronavirus.
Mr. Biden said the country also needed a strong economic response, and urged Congress to press for emergency paid leave for workers affected by the outbreak, an expansion and broadening of unemployment benefits and temporary loans for small businesses dealing with revenue shortfalls.
Some of those steps, including paid leave, have been pushed by the president, who has said workers affected by the virus should be able to ""stay home without fear of financial hardship.""
The president has also pressed for payroll-tax relief and said the Small Business Administration will soon offer low-interest loans to small businesses.
Mr. Biden's campaign announced Wednesday its own advisory committee on coronavirus, bringing together several former Obama officials to provide what he described as science-based, expert advice on ways the campaign can minimize health risks for the candidate, staff and supporters.
But more than simply advising the campaign, the list of people served as a preview of the type of administration Mr. Biden might assemble if elected.
The committee includes former Obama homeland security and counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco, Dr. David Kessler, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and Dr. Vivek Murthy, who served as the nation's surgeon general.
Mr. Biden ""was there during the economic crisis, he oversaw the bailout. He's been there,"" said Dr. Zeke Emanuel, an advisory committee member and a vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania. ""More importantly, no single person can address these issues.""

Joe Biden won all three primaries held Tuesday on a day filled with anxious voting, building a lead in the Democratic presidential nomination race that appears increasingly difficult for Bernie Sanders to overcome.
For up-to-the-minute news on the Democratic presidential primaries, please see
WSJ's Live Coverage

The two-man race lurched forward against major disruptions triggered by
the coronavirus pandemic
as the first balloting was held—in Florida, Illinois and Arizona—since the crisis engulfed the nation. As of Wednesday morning, the former vice president had 52.8% of the delegates allocated so far and 57.6% of the number needed to win the nomination.
In Florida, a critical battleground state in the general election, Mr. Biden won nearly three times as many votes as the Vermont senator and carried all 67 counties. With 99% of Illinois precincts reporting, Mr. Biden had 59.1% of the vote versus 36.1% for Mr. Sanders. In Arizona, with 88% of the vote in, the former vice president had 43.6% against his rival's 31.6%.
The latest large victories for Mr. Biden are likely to place more pressure on Mr. Sanders to exit from the race so the party can focus on President Trump. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Sunday showed
Mr. Biden was favored nationally, 61% to 32%
, among those who have already voted in the Democratic primary or plan to do so.
Mr. Biden, speaking from his home in Wilmington, Del., said his campaign is moving toward winning the nomination as he reached out to his rival's supporters. He delivered his address via a live stream to avoid gathering supporters during the pandemic.
""We've moved closer to securing the Democratic Party's nomination for president, and we're doing it by building a broad coalition,"" he said.
Mr. Biden said he and Mr. Sanders ""may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision"" on issues such as health care, wealth inequality and climate change. He told young voters inspired by Mr. Sanders, ""I hear you, I know what's at stake.""
Mr. Biden already is trying to unify the party behind him, endorsing policy proposals related to bankruptcy laws and college tuition
in a bid to woo liberals
. Mr. Sanders acknowledged last week that he's losing the ""debate over electability"" among Democrats.
During a live stream address Tuesday evening, Mr. Sanders outlined his proposals to blunt the effects of the coronavirus outbreak. He didn't mention the primary elections or his narrowing prospects.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee noted Tuesday night that Mr. Trump had secured enough delegates through the GOP primaries to become the party's ""presumptive nominee"" for president.
""Nobody motivates our base more than President Trump, as evidenced by the historic turnout we've seen in state after state this primary season,"" Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement. ""Fueled by both our longtime supporters and the thousands of new voters that continue to join our movement, we are united and enthusiasm is on our side.""
Ohio had been expected to hold a primary on Tuesday, but it joined a growing list of states
that have delayed their contests
until May or June in hopes the coronavirus situation will improve.
On the eve of the balloting, a court there rejected a request to postpone the state's primary until June 2 as Republican Gov. Mike DeWine had recommended. The in-person voting was subsequently placed on hold after the state's top health official ordered polls closed.
The Ohio Supreme Court denied a last-minute legal challenge to the postponement, and county election boards were deluged with phone calls from confused, frustrated voters.
In a statement released late Tuesday, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez called for states with upcoming primaries and caucuses to use vote by mail and other alternatives to casting ballots in person.
""What happened in Ohio last night has only bred more chaos and confusion,"" he said, adding that states should focus on figuring out how to make voting easier and safer as opposed to postponing primaries ""when timing around the virus remains unpredictable.""
This round of contests might be the last significant ones for some time, if more states announce primary postponements.

Voters, sobered by the crisis, also cast ballots in local and state contests as they confronted school closures, travel limitations, event cancellations and a stressed global economy. Germs were also on their minds.
At a polling location inside a Miami fire station, workers wore gloves as they inspected voter identification cards and dispensed hand sanitizer to visitors. Some voters arrived with their own pens, gloves and disinfecting wipes.
Officials in Chicago, the biggest city within the three states that voted Tuesday, said election-day turnout was low as nervous voters stayed home. Still, many had cast ballots early. Officials said the previous primary record for such voting was easily surpassed and vote-by-mail applications more than tripled compared with 2016.
James Allen, a Chicago Board of Election Commissioners spokesman, told reporters Tuesday that city election officials failed last week to convince Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker to cancel in-person voting and replace it with vote-by-mail balloting.
Pritzker spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh said in a statement that the governor's office had offered ""to provide the National Guard to help staff the election"" as well as assistance in recruiting volunteers to fill in for election workers anxious about staffing polling places.

""The governor cannot unilaterally cancel or delay an election,"" she said. ""Elections are the cornerstone of our democracy and we could not risk confusion and disenfranchisement in the courts. No one is saying this is a perfect solution. We have no perfect solutions at the moment. We only have the least bad solutions.""
Some Chicago polls opened late because workers didn't show up or equipment wasn't delivered on time, while some voters were confused about where they were supposed to vote after about 200 of the city's 2,069 precinct voting locations had to be moved.
Voting-rights advocates said they fielded questions from confused voters and poll workers in multiple states because of changes made to polling locations to avoid nursing homes and other vulnerable sites.
""It's unprecedented for us to be addressing this much confusion around basic questions that voters have during a primary election, like where is my polling place,"" Ami Gandhi, senior counsel at the Chicago Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, told reporters.

CLINTON, Iowa—Before President Trump, no American president had ever sought re-election in the middle of
an impeachment
.
Former Vice President Joe Biden is contending with a similar distinction in the Democratic primaries, as a White House candidate caught up in the impeachment of Mr. Trump, whose trial centers around his pressing Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden, a possible opponent in this year's election.
Days before
the Iowa caucuses
, Mr. Biden is trying to turn Republican efforts to damage him in the impeachment trial into a badge of honor and a sign of his resilience. His campaign hopes it will help him appeal to Democratic voters struggling to answer the contest's biggest question: Which Democrat is best positioned to defeat Mr. Trump in November's general election?
""This whole impeachment trial for Trump is just a political hit job to smear me,"" Mr. Biden told an audience Tuesday night in Clinton, a community along the Mississippi River. ""That's how scared Trump is about having to run against me.""
In a sign of his push to show he's the most electable Democrat, Mr. Biden planned to deliver an address Thursday to supporters in Waukee, a suburb of Des Moines, that would directly take on the president and serve as a prebuttal to Mr. Trump's evening rally at Drake University.
When Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst suggested the Senate's trial in Washington could undercut Mr. Biden's appeal in Iowa, his campaign quickly seized upon her comments and posted a digital ad.
Mr. Trump's lawyers argued this week that the president was justified in seeking investigations into Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who served on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma while Mr. Biden was vice president. Mr. Biden has said he did nothing wrong in pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who had at one time been involved in investigating Burisma and who was widely viewed as
insufficiently aggressive on corruption
. Mr. Biden has also noted he was carrying out the Obama administration's Ukraine policy, which was in line with international partners on rooting out corruption.
A career State Department official told lawmakers last year that he
raised concerns in 2015
about Hunter Biden's position at Burisma, which he thought could appear to be a conflict of interest. According to one official with ties to the company, Hunter Biden's compensation was around $50,000 a month.
Hunter Biden has said
that he showed ""poor judgment"" in joining the board but that he only discussed his work with Burisma with his father once.
Mr. Biden rarely hears questions from voters about the impeachment trial. But the uncertainty over how long it will last has loomed over the final week in Iowa.
Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar have been forced to scrap most of their Iowa campaign schedules to attend the trial. (A fourth senator running for president, Michael Bennet of Colorado, has focused his long-shot bid on New Hampshire).
The
possibility of testimony
at the impeachment trial from witnesses, such as former national security adviser John Bolton, could mean the proceeding spills over into campaigning ahead of the Feb. 11 New Hampshire primary.
It also could increase the likelihood that Mr. Biden's son, or even Mr. Biden himself, might be called to testify. The former vice president has rejected suggestions of an exchange involving Mr. Bolton and others for his own testimony or that of his son.
He told reporters this week that he had ""nothing to defend. This is all a game.""
Republicans, meanwhile, haven't been subtle about trying to use the trial to undermine Mr. Biden's candidacy.
Ms. Ernst, who is seeking re-election this year, told reporters on Capitol Hill that she was ""really interested"" to see how the arguments made by Mr. Trump's legal team ""informs and influences the Iowa caucus voters.""
Mr. Biden pounced, reading aloud the senator's comments during his events in Iowa. The campaign placed a homemade sign on the wall that said, ""Joni—We're w/ Joe.""
""She spilled the beans,"" said Mr. Biden, who told his supporters, ""You can ruin Donald Trump's night by caucusing for me, but also you can ruin Joni Ernst's night.""
One of Ms. Ernst's Senate colleagues, meanwhile, bought airtime in Iowa to bolster
Mr. Trump's defense
. Sen. Rick Scott (R., Fla.) cut a 30-second ad accusing Mr. Biden of getting away with a pressure campaign against Ukraine and helping his son profit from his position, charges the Bidens and supporters have denied.

This Year's Iowa Caucuses Are Different. Here's How They'll Work.

""I just see that as part of the desperation of the Republicans in facing him, that they've got to try to drag him and his son into this,"" said Jeff Hermiston, a retired teacher from West Liberty, Iowa, who saw Mr. Biden at a recent event and plans to caucus for him. ""I realize it's peripheral to the issue, but it's not the issue.""
Mr. Biden has tried to turn the GOP criticism into a sign of his strength as a candidate and his ability to move past such drama. ""I hope I've demonstrated that I can take a punch,"" he said in Cedar Falls, Iowa.

CLINTON, Iowa—Before President Trump, no American president had ever sought re-election in the middle of
an impeachment
.
Former Vice President Joe Biden is contending with a similar distinction in the Democratic primaries, as a White House candidate who also has been pulled into the impeachment battle.

CHARLESTON, S.C.—Joe Biden and his allies are trying to consolidate
centrist voters
behind his candidacy in the final days before Saturday's
South Carolina primary
, with a key leader in this state endorsing him and a super PAC backing his bid making a major push for large donations.
Mr. Biden is running out of time to turn the presidential race into a one-on-one battle with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Democratic front-runner who ranks a close second in recent polls in this state.
The former vice president notched the biggest pre-primary prize in South Carolina Wednesday, winning the endorsement of Rep. James Clyburn, the top-ranking black lawmaker in Congress and the most influential Democrat in the state.
Mr. Clyburn invoked his late wife, Emily Clyburn, who died in September, and his constituents during an emotional announcement in which he said he wanted the public to know who he would back for president. ""I know Joe. We know Joe. But most importantly, Joe knows us,"" Mr. Clyburn said.
The endorsement comes as a pro-Biden super PAC called Unite the Country has been pressing donors to help it defend Mr. Biden here and in the coming 14-state delegate sweepstakes known as
Super Tuesday
. The super PAC's organizers said in a memo to donors Sunday that ""the challenge we face is obvious: Senator Sanders has a solid, though not nearly majority base among Democratic primary voters, and the rest of the Democratic vote is split 4-5-6 ways.""
Mr. Biden is competing in a crowded lane of center-left rivals alongside former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, splintering votes among multiple candidates as Mr. Sanders rises. The Vermont lawmaker
won the Nevada primary
last Saturday,
secured a narrow win
in New Hampshire and essentially tied for first in Iowa earlier this month.
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who once challenged Mr. Sanders for the hearts of liberals, has used two strong
debate performances
to present herself as the candidate who can unite the party but
is lagging in delegates
so far. And in South Carolina, billionaire activist Tom Steyer has spent more than $21 million in advertising, threatening to siphon votes from Mr. Biden among African-Americans.
As Mr. Sanders aims for victories in coming delegate-rich states such as California and Texas, the dynamics in the race among the group of moderates creates little incentive for any candidate to leave the race unless they run out of money.
Mr. Buttigieg, who narrowly won Iowa and finished second in New Hampshire, is trailing Mr. Sanders in the hunt for delegates. And both Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Warren have home-state contests on March 3, giving them a potential opportunity to capture delegates.
Mr. Biden, who once led national polls, hopes to use South Carolina as a launchpad for the March states, including many in the South with large African-American communities.
No one wants to cede ground to billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into states holding primaries in March and
will be on the ballot
for the first time in a matter of days.
That means Mr. Sanders, as the leading liberal in the race, could pile up delegates on Super Tuesday and build a potentially insurmountable lead against a fractured field.
""That's the dilemma,"" said Matt Bennett, a co-founder of the centrist think tank Third Way. ""I don't think anyone has a solution to that problem. Everyone stipulates it would be better if we could get down to one sooner and no one has the faintest idea how that could possibly happen…No one is going to push any of them out of the race at this point.""

Publicly, at least, no one is calling for any of the candidates to drop out.
""I'm not in the life-coaching business, and I'm only giving advice to one candidate and that is Joe Biden,"" said Rep. Cedric Richmond (D., La.), a co-chairman of Mr. Biden's campaign, when asked if others should step aside. ""Other campaigns will have to make their own decisions after we win South Carolina on Saturday.""
Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, recalled his role as Mr. Sanders's driver during the senator's long-shot—and losing—bid for governor in Vermont as a third-party candidate in 1986. ""If people want to run, they should run,"" Mr. Weaver said.
But he added: ""It's no secret that there are a few candidates on stage for whom the next week may be decisive in their future prospects.""
The pro-Biden super PAC has noted in its pitch to donors that several states holding primaries on March 3 have large African-American populations that could help the former vice president, including Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.
""It boils down to this: The month of March will decide whether Democrats will nominate Senator Sanders or someone else,"" organizers said in the memo. ""The only other viable option at this point is Joe Biden. But the time to act is now.""

MILWAUKEE—As six Democratic candidates faced off in Iowa on Tuesday evening, President Trump, less than 400 miles away, sought to insert himself into the process at a rally for his reelection campaign.
Former Vice President Joe Biden? ""Sleepy."" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren? ""Not going anywhere.""
But Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders? ""Surging.""
Trump campaign aides and political allies view Mr. Sanders, a self-declared socialist, as an easier opponent than other potential contenders. Mr. Trump has tweeted about Mr. Sanders twice this week, saying on Sunday that he was ""looking very good"" and stoking the
clash between the two leading liberals
in the race. ""Elizabeth is very angry at Bernie. Do I see a feud brewing?"" he
tweeted
Monday.
Mr. Sanders has
ticked up in recent national polls
, but is separated from Messrs. Biden and Warren by a few percentage points. Unlike Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders has never polled above 30% among Democrats nationally in this election cycle.
The president also sided with Mr. Sanders in a growing clash between him and Ms. Warren over whether the Vermont senator told Ms. Warren in a 2018 meeting that he didn't believe a woman could win the election. Mr. Warren confirmed that characterization after it was reported by CNN; Mr. Sanders has denied it.
""I don't believe that he said this,"" Mr. Trump told a packed arena in Milwaukee. ""I don't particularly like him, the nasty guy, but…[it's] not the kind of thing he'd say.""
Mr. Trump had low expectations for the Democrats' face-off. ""Nobody is watching,"" he said. ""They haven't been doing great on the debates, I have to tell you.""
Mr. Trump also sought to create a split screen between his actions as president and Democrats' efforts to oust him from office, a strategy that campaign aides have said they intend to pursue over the course of the election year.
""While we're creating jobs and killing terrorists, Democrats in Congress are wasting America's time with demented, hoaxes and crazy witch hunts,"" the president said.
The House is set to vote Wednesday to name impeachment managers and send the articles of impeachment to the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said he expects to
start the president's impeachment trial next Tuesday
, when Mr. Trump is scheduled to be in Davos, Switzerland, for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum.
Tuesday's rally marked the president's second of the election year and his first time in Wisconsin since July, when he traveled to Milwaukee to give a speech on trade.
Wisconsin, a state Mr. Trump won in 2016 by fewer than 23,000 votes, is a key battleground in the 2020 race. Top Democrats had already collectively t
raveled to the state 10 times
by September, and Wisconsin is one of four states where a top Democratic group, Priorities USA, plans to spend $150 million before the convention this summer in Milwaukee.
The Trump campaign has also signaled it plans to make Wisconsin a priority. Lara Trump, a senior adviser to the campaign and the president's daughter-in-law, traveled there for an event Monday. Jared Kushner, a senior White House adviser and the president's son-in-law, was also in Milwaukee on Tuesday for a criminal justice event.

WASHINGTON—House managers said President Trump was a threat to American democracy, while his defense team countered that Democrats were trying to undermine two elections, in their final arguments in his Senate
impeachment trial
on Monday.
With Democrats set to fall well short of the two-thirds threshold needed to remove Mr. Trump from office in the final vote later this week, they used their turns at the lectern to issue a warning to the Senate, focusing on what they saw as the danger presented by Mr. Trump remaining in office.
""He has betrayed our national security and he will do so again,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the lead impeachment manager and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. ""He has compromised our elections and he will do so again. You will not change him. You cannot constrain him. He is who he is.… Now, do impartial justice and convict him.""
The
two articles of impeachment
center on Mr. Trump's pressing Ukraine
to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden
and other matters that could help Mr. Trump politically in this year's election, and the president's alleged efforts to obstruct Congress's inquiry into those actions.
Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing and again called impeachment a hoax on Twitter on Monday.
His legal team, in their presentation, painted Democrats' pursuit of impeachment as purely political, driven by a longstanding dislike of Mr. Trump, a Republican.
""At the end of the day, this is an effort to overturn the results of one election and to try to interfere in the coming election that begins today in Iowa,"" said White House counsel Pat Cipollone.
Iowa's caucuses
on Monday evening kicked off the Democratic and GOP nominating contests.
""What the House Democrats have done to this nation, to the Constitution, to the office of the president, to the president himself and to this body is outrageous,"" said another Trump team lawyer, Jay Sekulow.

*
How Republicans Scotched the Idea of Witnesses in Impeachment Trial

The two sides gave their final pitches Monday to the jury of 100 senators who had largely made up their minds on impeachment, broadly unmoved by three weeks of presentations and arguments.
An acquittal for Mr. Trump is expected on Wednesday. Twenty Republicans would have to join the entire Democratic caucus to vote to remove the president. No Republicans have said they favor impeachment, and just two supported Democrats' effort last week to seek more evidence in the trial, which failed 51-49.
Democratic senators emerged from the trial frustrated that most GOP senators
had rejected bringing in new witnesses and information
. Republicans countered that the House impeachment probe should have sought more evidence, which was blocked by the White House, before turning the matter over to the Senate.
""I'm trying to find the Senate rule that says for senators to plug their ears with cotton so they don't have to listen to the hard facts,"" Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) said.
Some Republicans, including Sens. Pat Roberts of Kansas and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, said they believe Mr. Trump engaged in improper behavior, but that it didn't rise to an impeachable offense. But others were unconvinced.
Mr. Trump's defense team ""raised a reasonable doubt as to the crime—the whatever—that was alleged,"" Sen. Bill Cassidy (R., La.) said.
Democrats allege in the first article of impeachment that Mr. Trump attempted to interfere with this year's presidential election by pressing Kyiv to probe Mr. Biden, a front-runner for the Democratic nomination. The second article accuses Mr. Trump of obstructing Congress's investigation by preventing witnesses from testifying and defying subpoenas for documentary evidence.
Mr. Trump and his allies have argued that Mr. Trump's interest in Mr. Biden was legitimate, alleging it was corrupt for Mr. Biden during the Obama administration to seek the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who once investigated a Ukrainian gas company where Mr. Biden's son Hunter sat on the board. Mr. Biden sought the prosecutor's removal as part of a broad international effort to combat corruption in Ukraine.
The Bidens have denied wrongdoing. Hunter Biden has said it was poor judgment on his part to serve on the Burisma board while his father was involved with Ukraine policy as vice president.
What isn't clear is whether the acquittal vote will be bipartisan. Some Democratic senators, such as Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Doug Jones of Alabama and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, are undecided. Mr. Jones, representing a state that backed Mr. Trump by 28 points in the 2016 election, is the most vulnerable Democratic senator this cycle.
Mr. Manchin said Monday he remained undecided on how he will vote on the impeachment articles, but introduced a measure to censure Mr. Trump, saying it would ""allow this body to unite across party lines…to formally denounce the president's actions.""
While censure was mentioned at times last year by some House Democrats as an alternative to impeachment, it hasn't been seriously discussed by Republican or Democratic leadership. Many Senate Republicans said Mr. Trump did nothing wrong, and those who find his actions problematic haven't called for him to be rebuked by Congress.
""Too late. It's too late,"" said Sen Roy Blunt (R., Mo.), a member of GOP Senate leadership, about censure.
Mr. Trump is scheduled to give his State of the Union speech Tuesday, in the chamber where the House approved the articles of impeachment against him in December. Some Republicans hoped he would move beyond impeachment in the annual speech.

A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll
published on Sunday found a majority of voters said they believed Mr. Trump abused his power by asking Ukraine to investigate a potential political opponent in order to influence the coming election, and that Mr. Trump obstructed Congress by not cooperating with the impeachment inquiry. But there wasn't majority support for removing him from office. The poll found 49% said he should be allowed to finish his term, compared with 46% who said he should be removed. Mr. Trump's job approval in the January poll stood at 46%, with 51% disapproving, in line with results throughout the Trump presidency.

WASHINGTON—The Obama administration struggled to develop a coordinated and effective response to Russian interference in the 2016 election, constrained in its options by partisanship in Washington and a lack of timely definitive attribution that Moscow was responsible, according to a bipartisan Senate report released Thursday.
The report, from the Senate Intelligence Committee, is the
first detailed government review
of how the Obama administration attempted to grapple with Russia's interference in the months leading up to the 2016 contest. The retrospective look came as U.S. agencies, states and social-media companies are preparing for a return of attempted foreign intervention in the 2020 contest.
The partially redacted 54-page report suggested high-level warnings of potential retaliation that top Obama officials delivered to senior Russian officials in the weeks before the election may have had limited impact on deterring Moscow's activities.
""The committee found that after the warnings, Russia continued its cyber activity, to include further public dissemination of stolen emails, clandestine social-media-based influence operations, and penetration of state voting infrastructure through Election Day 2016,"" the report said.
Several factors, both external and internal, hamstrung how President Obama and his advisers were able to address Russia's aggression, the report said, including a ""heavily politicized environment"" in Washington and a concern that public warnings could serve one of the Kremlin's chief aims by undermining confidence in the election.
But the report also detailed prolonged interagency disagreements among senior officials who were caught off guard by Russia's interference operations during the summer and fall of 2016—for example, officials interviewed for the report said they first learned of a hack on the Democratic National Committee from media reports, and viewed it as a case of routine espionage.
Conflicting cultures among intelligence agencies contributed to a delay in releasing a brief and somewhat vague public statement in October 2016 blaming Russia for the interference, which included
hacked Democratic emails
that were subsequently published by WikiLeaks and the peddling of divisive content on social media by Russia trolls and bots.
""After discovering the existence, if not the full scope, of Russia's election interference efforts in late-2016, the Obama administration struggled to determine the appropriate response,"" Sen. Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said.
Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the panel, said he remained concerned that structural problems that contributed to the Obama administration's stalled response hadn't been ameliorated.
""A legitimate fear raised by the Obama administration—that warning the public of the Russian attack could backfire politically—is still present in our hyperpartisan environment,"" Mr. Warner said.
Former senior Obama administration officials didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
Many of the core findings of the Senate report, including the interagency tensions, have been previously described.
The U.S. intelligence community
, former special counsel Robert Mueller and the Senate committee have all previously concluded that Russia, at the direction of President Vladimir Putin,
sought to disrupt the 2016 presidential contest
to boost then-candidate Donald Trump's electoral prospects and denigrate his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.
The report doesn't address in depth how Mr. Trump and his campaign dealt with the Russian interference.
Mr. Trump has frequently questioned
U.S. intelligence agencies' finding that Russia meddled in the 2016 election. In July 2016, he
publicly encouraged Russia to find missing emails
from a computer server used by Mrs. Clinton during her time as secretary of state. Mr. Mueller's report found no evidence that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia on election interference efforts.
The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the Senate report.
The report buttresses previous accounts describing how top Obama officials ran into resistance from some Republican leaders on Capitol Hill when they briefed them on classified intelligence on Russia's activities and asked for a bipartisan congressional statement of concern.
At a Sept. 8, 2016, congressional briefing, Lisa Monaco, Mr. Obama's homeland security adviser, recalled that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stated you ""security people should be careful that you're not getting used."" Ms. Monaco interpreted Mr. McConnell's comments as suggesting the intelligence on Russian activities was being inflated or used for partisan ends, the report said.
A spokesman for Mr. McConnell didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, said during a CNN town hall Wednesday night that it wasn't clear how expansive and sophisticated the Kremlin's interference operations were until after he and Mr. Obama left the White House. Despite ""overwhelming circumstantial evidence"" of Russia's involvement, Mr. Biden said, Mr. McConnell and other Republican leaders rejected the need to issue emphatic public denunciations of Moscow's conduct.
The Senate Intelligence Committee also found that the White House's decision to sharply limit sharing within the executive branch of information about Russia's unprecedented information warfare hampered the Obama administration's response.
Initial White House meetings on the subject were restricted to a ""small group"" that excluded the secretaries of State, Defense and Treasury, and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, although they were included in later meetings.
The meetings were ""cloak-and-dagger,"" and their purpose not identified on internal planning documents, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told the committee.
Committee member Sen. Angus King, co-chair of a commission expected to recommend a national cyberspace strategy next month, said in an interview that ""we're in a much better place"" to deal with election interference than in 2016, with state-level election systems more resilient and U.S. intelligence agencies more prepared.
But Mr. King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, said adversaries are evolving as well. Four years ago, Russia's efforts to disrupt U.S. politics via social media emanated from St. Petersburg. ""Now, they may be routing things through Liberia, Moldova, Thailand, who knows?""
In appended minority views, Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden and Martin Heinrich said the committee's work was inadequately thorough and suffered from a lack of access granted to the panel's own staff to investigative materials—echoing a flaw highlighted in the report.
""It is bizarre that the committee would not heed its own recommendation and grant access to this information to its own staff,"" Sen. Wyden said.

WASHINGTON -- As former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders square off for a third straight Tuesday of big primary contests, the coronavirus pandemic is increasingly pulling the attention of Americans away from the Democratic presidential race and causing uncertainty around voting.
An Ohio court on Monday evening rejected Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine's request to postpone the state's Tuesday primary. But the primary was still thrust into chaos as Mr. DeWine declared that the state's top health official will order polls closed on Tuesday as a ""health emergency.""
""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" Mr. DeWine tweeted hours after a judge ruled in favor of the primary taking place as planned.
Those developments came as Georgia, Louisiana and Kentucky, which had been set to hold primaries in the coming weeks, postponed them.
Three other states set to hold primaries Tuesday -- Arizona, Florida and Illinois -- appeared to be moving forward as planned, but each state moved some polling places away from nursing homes and other vulnerable sites.
On Monday, the Florida Democratic Party called on Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis to release an updated statewide list of polling sites and said party workers had begun calling and texting more than 126,700 voters who, by their estimate, live in an affected precinct and haven't yet voted.
Asked if the state planned to release a comprehensive list, a spokesman for the Florida Department of State said that voters should check with their local election supervisors.
In Illinois, the Board of Elections said the state is proceeding with Tuesday's primary as scheduled despite an order from Gov. J.B. Pritzker requiring that all restaurants and bars close for dine-in customers for a period of two weeks.
The board's spokesman said early voting has been encouraged and local election authorities have received guidance for coronavirus safety in their polling places. ""Primary voting typically is a swift transaction that can be done at a safe distance from other voters,"" Matt Dietrich, the spokesman, said.
Across the country, voters are likely to see several precautionary measures, such as frequently cleaned voting machines, hand sanitizer and more breaks for poll workers to wash their hands.
Mr. Biden is strongly favored in the states scheduled to vote Tuesday and could further cement his path to the nomination if he scores big victories over Mr. Sanders, whose aides acknowledged the senator faces an uphill battle.
In last week's Washington state primary, Mr. Biden narrowly defeated Mr. Sanders, according to projections Monday from the Associated Press. Mr. Biden's victory means he won five of the six states that held contests March 10.
The pandemic has drastically altered the shape of the campaigns, with strict guidance against large gatherings nationwide. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have both relied on digital events since last Tuesday, when both canceled election-night rallies.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign translates some Nevada events from English to Spanish in real time to engage with Spanish-speaking audience members. Organizers for South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg routinely hand out materials targeting Latino voters at naturalization ceremonies.
Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign runs Spanish-language phone banks in states like Nevada. And the campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says it has held at least 250 bilingual volunteer events with more than 3,200 attendees.
Democratic presidential candidates and
President Trump
are seeking new ways to use Spanish-language events and messages to make inroads with an estimated 32 million eligible Latino voters,
a key constituency
that could surpass black voters as the largest minority voting bloc in the U.S. next year.
In 2018, the number of Hispanics who turned out to vote reached 11.7 million, nearly double the 6.8 million in 2014, which Pew Research Center said was the single largest increase on record from one midterm election to another.
Activists have warned the Democratic Party against taking these voters for granted in the general election, but Latinos are also being wooed in the primaries in states where they make up a significant chunk of the electorate.
More than half of U.S. Latinos live in three states—California, Florida and Texas—that account for a big share of delegates to the 2020 Democratic National Convention. Nevada also has a large Latino population and plays an outsize role in picking the nominee because its caucuses are the third state contest.
Campaigns ""should be spending a lot of time, energy and resources looking at what makes this community of voters tick,"" said political strategist Lorena Chambers. ""What's going to compel them to come out and vote? We want to be excited about voting.""
She said that isn't limited to advertising in Spanish. ""It has to be culturally correct,"" she said, adding that if Spanish is used, it is important to keep in mind differences based on bilingual households, age or the country of origin. Recent Pew Research Center studies have shown English is rising among younger Latinos but Spanish is often still spoken at home.
Spokespeople from Spanish-language television network Univision Communications Inc. and Comcast Corp.'s Telemundo said they each have ad buys from more than one presidential campaign. They said the networks have seen more interest in political advertising to the growing number of Latino voters than in the past election cycles.
Andrew Polsky, chief revenue officer of Hispanic mobile-ad company Adsmovil, said his firm is working with presidential candidates on ads geared toward Latino voters. He expects more such advertising as the primaries pick up next year.
Of the roughly 25 million U.S. Hispanics in Adsmovil's data-management program, 14.9 million prefer to receive messages in Spanish and 10.6 million prefer English, according to the company.
So far, Mr. Sanders's campaign in particular has made Latino voters central to its strategy. National polls show him and Mr. Biden at the front of the pack among Latinos.
The Sanders campaign, which says it has at least 80 Latino staffers nationwide, has launched Spanish-language phone banks and sends text messages in Spanish to remind Latino voters to register to vote or attend events. His campaign is running ads in Spanish that highlight issues dominating the Democratic primary, such as health care, climate change and income inequality.
Last month, he unveiled an immigration plan designed by three campaign staffers who are undocumented immigrants and beneficiaries of former President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. And in mid-December, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has endorsed Mr. Sanders, participated in a Nevada town-hall meeting that was entirely in Spanish.
Mr. Biden's campaign, meanwhile, has rolled out endorsements from dozens of Latino leaders, including some members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Spanish-language ads released by his campaign draw a contrast with Mr. Trump and his immigration policies, casting the former vice president as best positioned to unite a divided country.
Melissa Michelson, a political-science professor at Menlo College in California whose work has focused on Latino and minority politics, said voters in that group are driven by the same priorities as the broader Democratic electorate.
""They're concerned about electability,"" Ms. Michelson said. ""They want a candidate who's going to beat Donald Trump.""
Mr. Trump's re-election campaign has been courting Latino voters with advertising, events and volunteer training in Florida, the battleground he narrowly won in 2016, and more than a dozen other swing states, a senior Trump campaign official said. It has been running Spanish-language digital ads since March, the official said.
Ads in Spanish and English are designed to appeal to Hispanic diaspora communities who fled socialist countries, like Venezuela, but also focus more broadly on job opportunities, the tax bill, the economy and criminal-justice reform.
The campaign also plans to increase in the coming months Spanish-language ads geared toward increasing Latino turnout at Trump rallies, the official said.
Still, some of the messaging stands in contrast to the Trump campaign's Facebook ads targeting the broader electorate, which highlight his attempts to crack down on immigration and ask supporters to sign petitions to ""deport illegals.""
Democrats contend that Mr. Trump's rhetoric on immigration has cemented their standing among Latinos.
Other top-polling Democratic candidates, such Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg, are still seeking to gain traction among Latino voters.
Mr. Buttigieg's campaign has focused not just on the early battleground of Nevada, where it recently bought Spanish-language radio and digital ads, but also on rural parts of Iowa and New Hampshire, where it contends Latino voters are being overlooked. Mr. Sanders has also dedicated some of his ad spending to reaching Latino voters in Iowa.
Ms. Warren has homed in on Nevada, where her campaign has had Spanish speakers on the ground since its launch, according to her Nevada political director Michelle Villegas.
A September poll from Univision found 73% of Latinos said they plan to vote for the Democratic nominee in the general election next year, whereas 16% planned to vote for Mr. Trump, and 11% were undecided.

HOUSTON -- Bernie Sanders's resounding victory in the weekend's Nevada caucuses cast him as the clear front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination and enhanced the Vermont senator's argument that he can build a diverse coalition of voters ahead of potentially decisive contests.
At the same time, the senator's latest win, and his momentum ahead of next Saturday's South Carolina primary and the Super Tuesday contests March 3, are stirring increasing anxiety among some establishment Democrats who believe a more centrist nominee would have a better chance to beat President Trump in November and help carry down-ballot candidates across the finish line. If Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, performs well on March 3, when more than one-third of the total convention delegates are up for grabs, it could be difficult for any Democratic rival to overtake him.
Mr. Sanders has said he can expand the electorate by bringing in new voters, which would help him overcome any concerns about ideology in a general election.
Nevada, a more diverse state than mostly white Iowa and New Hampshire, gave Mr. Sanders the first opportunity to show he can build the ""multigeneration, multiracial coalition"" he has said will propel him. This year's Nevada caucuses are on track to break turnout records.
""We have won the popular vote in Iowa, we won the New Hampshire primary, we won the Nevada caucus,"" Mr. Sanders told supporters in Houston on Sunday, at a rally ahead of the March 3 Texas primary. ""Don't tell anybody this, these folks get very, very agitated and nervous, we're gonna win here in Texas, and in November, we're going to defeat Trump here in Texas.""
Mr. Sanders's strong position shows the appeal of running as antiestablishment on both sides of the aisle; Mr. Trump, after all, ran as a GOP outsider in 2016. The Vermont senator's position would have been unimaginable five years ago, when the independent, who has never changed his party affiliation to Democrat in the Senate, launched his first long-shot bid for the presidency.
But with his policy positions long seen as far to the left of many Democrats, many party veterans are haunted by the memory of liberal Sen. George McGovern's 49-state loss to GOP President Richard Nixon in 1972. A nomination of Mr. Sanders would mark a decisive break with the more center-left path forged by Bill Clinton in 1992 and Barack Obama in 2008.
Mr. Sanders leads Mr. Trump in a poll of a general-election matchup, although his margin is thinner than those of some other top contenders.
With about 88% of Nevada precincts reporting Sunday evening, former Vice President Joe Biden -- a more moderate candidate who was the national polling leader for most of 2019 -- was in second place, followed by Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Billionaire activist Tom Steyer looked set to place fifth while Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar followed closely behind in sixth.
Mr. Biden attended church services on Sunday in a predominantly black neighborhood of North Charleston, S.C. In an acknowledgment of Mr. Sanders's strength in the three prior contests, Mr. Biden told reporters: ""Whoever wins this primary is going into Super Tuesday very strongly, and I think it's going to be Bernie and me going into Super Tuesday.""
According to entrance polls in Nevada, Mr. Sanders won nearly every demographic segment -- including voters ages 17 to 64, white voters, Latino voters and first time caucus-goers. The only segments he lost to Mr. Biden were black voters, voters over age 65 and voters opposed to a single-payer health-care system.
Mr. Sanders's coalition will be put to the test in the next round of states. In his unsuccessful 2016 primary bid against Hillary Clinton, he struggled to bring in support from minorities.
While Mr. Sanders trails Mr. Biden in South Carolina, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Friday showed the two men running even among black Democratic primary voters nationally, a crucial part of Mr. Biden's constituency.
Mr. Biden mingled with churchgoers who generally represent his base of support. Ken Morris, a 68-year-old retired member of the Marine Corps, said he believed Mr. Sanders couldn't win the general election.
""There's not too many people who believe in socialism,"" Mr. Morris said. ""Joe is more centrist. More people trust him. You can't beat a guy who is all the way to the right by going all the way to the left.""
Voters, particularly those who are younger, say Mr. Sanders's consistency on the issues of health care, climate change and education is why they back him. Some older voters who were skeptical of Mr. Sanders say they see he has the momentum -- backed by a swell of enthusiastic young supporters -- to win.
Steve McCormack, a 49-year-old business owner from the Houston suburb of The Woodlands, attended Mr. Sanders's Houston rally on Sunday. Mr. McCormack voted for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio in the 2016 GOP primary and sat out the general election.
But this cycle, Mr. McCormack said is going to vote ""blue no matter who,"" and he believes Mr. Sanders may be the nominee.
""I see it might be going this way"" toward Mr. Sanders winning the primary, he said.
But some Democrats and groups looking to boost centrists aren't ready to concede.
""The race is not over, said Jonathan Kott, executive director of the Big Tent Project, which is running ads opposing Mr. Sanders in South Carolina. ""You have a lot of people still in the race, you have a lot of people that could win in different states.""

The political revolution Bernie Sanders hoped would sweep him into the White House has run into the cold, hard realities of math: He needs to win roughly 63% of the remaining unallocated Democratic delegates to overtake Joe Biden and win the presidential nomination.
To capture that many delegates, the Vermont senator would likely need to notch a victory in every state by significant margins because Democrats award delegates proportionally rather than using a winner-take-all system. That means the former vice president would continue to collect some, even if he lost momentum.
""The math would require an unprecedented turn of events that has Joe Biden winning these contests by 30 to 40 percentage points, to Bernie winning by 30 to 40 percentage points to cover lost ground and get back into this race,"" said George Hornedo, a delegate strategist for Pete Buttigieg's former presidential campaign. ""That's just not going to happen unless there is some catastrophic event.""
Mr. Hornedo said no Democratic candidate in modern history has ever come back from a delegate deficit as large as the one Mr. Sanders faces. Mr. Biden leads by 296 delegates as of late Wednesday afternoon, following
double-digit victories in a trio of states
—Arizona, Illinois and Florida—on Tuesday.
Those victories follow wins in about three-fourths of the states that voted earlier this month.
In an email to supporters Wednesday, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane Sanders, would head back Wednesday to Burlington, Vt., where they will
assess the path forward
.
""No sugarcoating it, last night did not go the way we wanted,"" Mr. Shakir wrote. ""And while our campaign has won the battle of ideas, we are losing the battle over electability to Joe Biden.""
The Sanders campaign declined to comment on his difficult path.
""The margins that Biden is winning by are telling us that people are ready for this to be done,"" said Mr. Hornedo. ""He has a lead that is insurmountable.""
The delegate math is made even more complicated by the coronavirus pandemic that has upended normal life, including the voting process. Multiple states have already delayed their contests and more may do so.
During this year's earliest primaries and caucuses, Mr. Sanders benefited from a crowded field that splintered the vote and delegates among multiple candidates. In a two-way race, he is no longer being boosted by the vote fracturing.
This week's primaries are a good example of why it would be so hard for Mr. Sanders to catch up. While not all delegates have been allocated yet, Mr. Biden has so far won 66.9% of those awarded from Tuesday's contests.
A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Sunday showed the race doesn't look better for Mr. Sanders going forward. Mr. Biden led by 63% to 30% among primary voters in states that had already held primaries or caucuses and by 60% to 34% in the states that had yet to vote.
The first candidate to reach 1,991 delegates, or a majority of the total delegates, will be the nominee. But the system is set up so that can't happen quickly.
Even if Mr. Sanders were to drop out of the race this week, it would likely take Mr. Biden until at least early May to secure the delegates needed to win the nomination. That assumes more contests aren't pushed back later because of the national crisis.
Mr. Sanders has said he would do everything he could to help Mr. Biden win a general election if he were to lose the nomination.
In an interview with the Journal last week, Jane Sanders said she was hoping the campaign would turn around. But if Mr. Biden becomes the nominee, ""Our role is clear: Help him to defeat Donald Trump,"" she said.
Then, Mrs. Sanders said, the Sanders family and progressive allies would keep up the leftward pressure on a Biden administration.

Nearly 380,000 more people voted in Michigan this year than in the state's 2016 Democratic primary, a 30% increase. And yet Sen. Bernie Sanders, in all-but-complete results, wound up with fewer votes than last time. Former Vice President Joe Biden, alone, benefited from the surge.
Of all the statistics arising from
Mr. Biden's dominating victories
in four primaries on Tuesday, those numbers are among the most revealing about the Democratic Party as it sorts out its presidential nominee.
Political analysts said the results signaled that Mr. Biden was unifying the party, leaving Mr. Sanders with few voter groups with which to build a competing coalition. And the big uptick in Democratic turnout, they said, suggested that Michigan likely would be tougher for President Trump than in 2016, when he carried the state by fewer than 11,000 votes.
""I don't know how you read the results any other way than that Michigan will be a more challenging state for the president,'' said Whit Ayres, a pollster and analyst whose clients have included Republican senators and presidential candidates.
Tim Murtaugh, communications director for Mr. Trump's re-election campaign, said that his coalition is growing and that the Michigan results showed high enthusiasm for the president. Mr. Trump, he said, ""has energized young voters like no other Republican candidate before him, while it's clear that Joe Biden will have a youth problem."" Exit polls showed Mr. Biden trailing Mr. Sanders by four-to-one among voters under age 30 in Michigan.
Mr. Biden's victories on Tuesday were sweeping. He carried every county in Missouri, Mississippi and Michigan on the way to winning four of the five states where the outcome was known, losing only North Dakota. Messrs. Biden and Sanders were tied as of Wednesday in a sixth primary, in Washington state, where the count was incomplete.
Within those tallies were signs of the broad coalition that Mr. Biden has been able to build, and of what that might mean both for the primaries to come and in November.
In Michigan, Mr. Biden benefited from the same surge of affluent, college-educated voters who
helped revive his campaign in Super Tuesday voting
last week and make him the Democratic primary front-runner. But he also won substantial victories among blue-collar voters in Michigan, the first Midwestern industrial state to vote and one of the most important battlegrounds for the fall.
While Mr. Sanders has promised to ignite a grass-roots, workers' movement, it was Mr. Biden who united the Democratic Party's professional class and its working class.
Combined with Mr. Biden's strength among black voters, the results suggest that Mr. Sanders is having trouble building support beyond his base of young voters—a shrinking share of the voter pool, compared with 2016—and Hispanic voters, who didn't have a large presence in the states that voted on Tuesday.
Mr. Biden can point to Tuesday's results to support his claim to have the stronger appeal among two voting groups important to his party's prospects in November.
One is the white, working-class voters of the industrial Midwest, whom Mr. Trump moved so successfully into the GOP in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Ohio. The other group is college-educated, suburban voters who swung behind Democratic candidates in 2018 and gave them a majority in the House.
Two counties in Michigan show Mr. Biden's strength with these groups—and how much ground Mr. Sanders has lost since his 2016 campaign.
With its cluster of hospitals and ""medical mile,'' Kent County includes Grand Rapids, the state's second-largest city, and has many of the voters with college and advanced degrees who are increasingly aligning with the Democratic Party. Mr. Sanders won it by 25 percentage points in 2016. In a significant reversal, he narrowly lost the county on Tuesday.
Voting surged by 50% over 2016 levels in Kent County, but Mr. Sanders barely kept pace with his vote total from the last election. The additional voters came out to support Mr. Biden. Mr. Ayres saw it as a continuation of a trend from 2018, in which moderate, suburban voters rejected Republican incumbents and helped return Democrats to a majority in the House.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What do the results from Tuesday's primaries reveal to you about the electorate in 2020? Join the conversation below.
Macomb County, outside Detroit, includes auto industry employers and many blue-collar workers. Mr. Sanders had kept the race close there in 2016, winning 47% of the vote. But he was routed on Tuesday, carrying only 35% to Mr. Biden's 51%.
Bernie Porn, president of the polling firm Epic MRA, said he believed many voters who cast ballots on Tuesday had skipped primaries in the past and voted only in general elections, an idea that can be tested in about a month, when the state updates its voter data.These voters tend to be less ideologically driven than are core members of a political party—that is, more welcoming of Mr. Biden than of Mr. Sanders, who calls for ""revolutionary'' change.
Kent County represents the Democrats' aspirations for drawing new, suburban voters to the party. Macomb County represents its hopes to regain blue-collar voters who were once a pillar of the party's support.
Both counties backed Mr. Trump in 2016, then two years later supported Democrats for the Senate and governor by narrow margins, raising the party's hopes that they could win the counties this fall.

WASHINGTON -- House managers said President Trump was a threat to American democracy, while his defense team countered that Democrats were trying to undermine two elections, in their final arguments in his Senate impeachment trial on Monday.
With Democrats set to fall well short of the two-thirds threshold needed to remove Mr. Trump from office in the final vote later this week, they used their turns at the lectern to issue a warning to the Senate, focusing on what they saw as the danger presented by Mr. Trump remaining in office.
""He has betrayed our national security and he will do so again,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the lead impeachment manager and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. ""He has compromised our elections and he will do so again. You will not change him. You cannot constrain him. He is who he is. . . . Now, do impartial justice and convict him.""
The two articles of impeachment center on Mr. Trump's pressing Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and other matters that could help Mr. Trump politically in this year's election, and the president's alleged efforts to obstruct Congress's inquiry into those actions.
Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing and again called impeachment a hoax on Twitter on Monday.
His legal team, in their presentation, painted Democrats' pursuit of impeachment as purely political, driven by a longstanding dislike of Mr. Trump, a Republican.
""At the end of the day, this is an effort to overturn the results of one election and to try to interfere in the coming election that begins today in Iowa,"" said White House counsel Pat Cipollone. Iowa's caucuses on Monday evening kicked off the Democratic and GOP nominating contests.
""What the House Democrats have done to this nation, to the Constitution, to the office of the president, to the president himself and to this body is outrageous,"" said another Trump lawyer, Jay Sekulow.
The two sides gave their final pitches Monday to the jury of 100 senators who had largely made up their minds on impeachment, broadly unmoved by three weeks of presentations and arguments.
An acquittal for Mr. Trump is expected on Wednesday. Twenty Republicans would have to join the entire Democratic caucus to vote to remove the president. No Republicans have said they favor impeachment, and just two supported Democrats' effort last week to seek more evidence in the trial, which failed 51-49.
Democratic senators emerged from the trial frustrated that most GOP senators had rejected bringing in new witnesses and information. Republicans countered that the House impeachment probe should have sought more evidence, which was blocked by the White House, before turning the matter over to the Senate.
""I'm trying to find the Senate rule that says for senators to plug their ears with cotton so they don't have to listen to the hard facts,"" Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) said.
Some Republicans, including Sens. Pat Roberts of Kansas and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, said they believe Mr. Trump engaged in improper behavior, but that it didn't rise to an impeachable offense. But others were unconvinced.
Mr. Trump's defense team ""raised a reasonable doubt as to the crime -- the whatever -- that was alleged,"" Sen. Bill Cassidy (R., La.) said.
Democrats allege in the first article of impeachment that Mr. Trump attempted to interfere with this year's presidential election by pressing Kyiv to probe Mr. Biden, a front-runner for the Democratic nomination. The second article accuses Mr. Trump of obstructing Congress's investigation by preventing witnesses from testifying and defying subpoenas for documentary evidence.
Mr. Trump and his allies have argued that Mr. Trump's interest in Mr. Biden was legitimate, alleging it was corrupt for Mr. Biden during the Obama administration to seek the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who once investigated a Ukrainian gas company where Mr. Biden's son Hunter sat on the board. Mr. Biden sought the prosecutor's removal as part of a broad international effort to combat corruption in Ukraine.
The Bidens have denied wrongdoing. Hunter Biden has said it was poor judgment on his part to serve on the Burisma board while his father was vice president.
What isn't clear is whether the acquittal vote will be bipartisan. Some Democratic senators, such as Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Doug Jones of Alabama and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, are undecided. Mr. Jones, representing a state that backed Mr. Trump by 28 points in the 2016 election, is the most vulnerable Democratic senator this cycle.
Mr. Manchin said Monday he remained undecided on how he will vote, but introduced a measure to censure Mr. Trump, saying it would ""allow this body to unite across party lines . . . to formally denounce the president's actions.""
While censure was mentioned at times last year by some House Democrats, it hasn't been seriously discussed by Republican or Democratic leadership. Many Senate Republicans said Mr. Trump did nothing wrong, and those who find his actions problematic haven't called for him to be rebuked by Congress.
""Too late. It's too late,"" said Sen Roy Blunt (R., Mo.), a member of GOP Senate leadership, about censure.
Mr. Trump is scheduled to give his State of the Union speech Tuesday, in the chamber where the House approved the articles of impeachment against him in December. Some Republicans hoped he would move beyond impeachment in the annual speech.
A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found a majority of voters said they believed Mr. Trump abused his power by asking Ukraine to investigate a potential political opponent. But there wasn't majority support for removing him from office.

WASHINGTON—Joe Biden is highlighting his decades of foreign policy experience, warning that what he calls President Trump's brinkmanship with Iran could push the nation into another Middle East conflict.
But as Mr. Biden is calling attention to his foreign policy experience as a globe-trotting vice president and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, his rivals are questioning his judgment on national security decisions. Among them: his 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq war during the George W. Bush administration and his initial opposition to the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.
The former vice president called Mr. Trump ""dangerously incompetent"" in remarks in New York Tuesday. He pressed the Trump administration to justify the
killing of Iran's top military leader
last week and blasted the president's decision to leave the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement.
""We are alone now—we're alone, and we will have to bear the cost of Donald Trump's folly,"" Mr. Biden said.
The Trump administration has said the strike that killed Qassem Soleimani, the second most powerful man in Iran, was necessary to avert an ""imminent"" threat to Americans. Mr. Trump said the intelligence he relied on to order the strike is classified for now but that details would be shared with members of Congress on Wednesday.

With less than a month before the Iowa caucuses, the Trump administration's escalating tensions with Iran could both elevate Mr. Biden among his Democratic rivals in the eyes of some voters and invite scrutiny.
The focus on Mr. Biden's foreign policy resume will also test voters' interest in Washington experience against the backdrop of a president who has often disrupted norms and flouted international conventions. If elected, Mr. Biden would enter office with more than four decades in Washington, vastly more than the four years Mr. Obama accumulated before winning the White House. (Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama's two predecessors, Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, had no Washington experience before their presidencies.)
""Fear historically instills in people a desire for stability and something they know,"" said Jen Psaki, a State Department spokeswoman under Mr. Obama. ""If it follows that historical context, ultimately the fact that Joe Biden is a familiar face and has a long interest and history in foreign policy—and has sat in the Situation Room—could be comforting to people watching.""
Until this month, foreign policy hasn't played a central role in the 2020 Democratic primary, taking a back seat to domestic issues such as health care, the economy and electability.
A
CNN poll
in November showed Mr. Biden with a significant advantage among Democrats on foreign policy. But Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg have tried to turn Mr. Biden's foreign policy record into a liability, focusing on his vote to authorize the invasion of Iraq. Mr. Obama used Hillary Clinton's Iraq vote against her in the run-up to his Iowa caucuses win a dozen years ago, as did Mr. Sanders during their 2016 primary race. Mr. Sanders had opposed the Iraq resolution as a House member.
In an interview Monday with CNN, Mr. Sanders said that Mr. Biden had ""voted and helped lead the effort for the war in Iraq, the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country.""
Mr. Buttigieg, who served in Afghanistan as a Naval intelligence analyst, has called the Iraq invasion the worst foreign policy decision of his lifetime. He said it shows ""why years in Washington is not always the same thing as judgment.""
At an event last weekend in Des Moines, Iowa, a young man pressed Mr. Biden on his Iraq war vote and the bin Laden raid and asked, ""How can we trust your judgment?""
Mr. Biden suggested that he was misled on Iraq by President George W. Bush, saying that Mr. Bush had told him he only wanted to send in inspectors to determine whether Saddam Hussein had nuclear weapons.
""The president then went ahead with 'Shock and Awe,' and right after that and from the very moment he did that, I opposed what he was doing,"" Mr. Biden said.
Mr. Biden's past statements, however, suggest he did not immediately oppose the war once it began in March 2003. In July 2003, Mr. Biden said during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, ""I voted to go into Iraq, and I'd vote to do it again.""
Discussing in Des Moines, Iowa, the bin Laden raid, Mr. Biden said that he had suggested in the Situation Room in front of other advisers that Mr. Obama ""do another pass to determine whether (bin Laden was) there."" However, he said, in the Oval Office, he had privately offered this advice to Mr. Obama: ""Mr. President, follow your instincts, go.""
At a 2012 House Democratic retreat, however, Mr. Biden said that his recommendation to Mr. Obama had been: ""Don't go."" Republicans have seized on Mr. Biden's different versions on the matter.
""Biden can't get his story straight. He used to say he advised Obama AGAINST the bin Laden raid. Now he denies it. Biden's foreign policy failures are a glaring liability for his 2020 campaign,"" tweeted Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee.
Mr. Biden's advisers dismiss such criticism of his record.
""The Republicans are going to try to manufacture issues, as this president has, as the Republican party has, about Joe Biden and about any other Democrat they think can be competitive in the general election against Donald Trump,"" said Anita Dunn, a top adviser to Mr. Biden.

Michael Bloomberg is ending his presidential bid and endorsing Joe Biden, after the former New York City mayor spent hundreds of millions of dollars of his own money in an expensive bet on
Super Tuesday
states that was
ultimately unsuccessful
.
""After yesterday's results, the delegate math has become virtually impossible—and a viable path to the nomination no longer exists,"" Mr. Bloomberg said Wednesday.
""I've always believed that defeating Donald Trump starts with uniting behind the candidate with the best shot to do it. After yesterday's vote, it is clear that candidate is my friend and a great American, Joe Biden,"" he said. ""I will work to make him the next president of the United States.""
His endorsement is the latest in
a string of successes
for Mr. Biden, the former vice president, who picked up the
backing of three other ex-rivals
for the Democratic nomination before Super Tuesday.
Mr. Bloomberg called Mr. Biden Wednesday, according to a campaign aide for the former mayor, who said they had a ""great conversation.""
Mr. Bloomberg announced his decision in a senior staff meeting on Wednesday. An email was then sent out to all staffers, followed by a staff call with campaign manager Kevin Sheekey and states director Dan Kanninen, according to the aide.
The former New York City mayor had earned just a few dozen delegates by Wednesday, as they were still being allocated, after spending $215 million
on TV and radio ads
in the 14 states that voted. The only contest he won was in American Samoa. Mr. Bloomberg is expected to address his staff and supporters at an event in New York City Wednesday afternoon.
Mr. Bloomberg pitched himself as a nonideological executive focused on beating President Trump, with the slogan ""Mike Will Get It Done"" and his seemingly limitless resources. In the days before the polls opened in Super Tuesday states, Mr. Bloomberg pointed to the administration's handling of the coronavirus outbreak to argue that he would be a more competent leader, spending $1.5 million on a prime-time, three-minute ad on two television networks.
Overall, Mr. Bloomberg, who is worth $62 billion, spent at least $620 million to build a massive campaign operation of more than 2,400 people across the country and to blanket the airwaves and digital platforms.
Before dropping out, he had insisted for days that he was ""in it to win it,"" while acknowledging that the only path for him to secure the Democratic nomination was through a contested convention.
Mr. Bloomberg had committed to keeping his organization even if he left the presidential race, saying he would pivot it toward helping the Democratic nominee and beating Mr. Trump. On Wednesday, following his endorsement of Mr. Biden, Mr. Bloomberg's advisers were still figuring out how that commitment would shape up.

""Mike has always said he would put all of his resources in defeating Trump and has never shied away from tough battles,"" said Tim O'Brien, senior adviser for the campaign. ""He deeply admires Joe Biden and will back his candidacy to the fullest extent.""
Mr. Bloomberg launched his campaign in late November after growing concerned about the rise of liberal Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. His advisers pointed to polling at the time that showed former Vice President Joe Biden, the most prominent moderate Democrat in the 2020 field, was within the margin of error in hypothetical matchups with Mr. Trump. Other candidates, they believed, would lose in the November election.
Mr. Bloomberg skipped the first four nominating contests because of his late entry, banking on the delegate-rich Super Tuesday states. And after Mr. Biden suffered big losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, Mr. Bloomberg appeared to have an opening.
But late in February came Mr. Biden's landslide
victory in South Carolina
, and the former vice president won the endorsements of three former presidential candidates. Mr. Biden ended up
racking up delegates on Super Tuesday
, crushing Mr. Bloomberg and other contenders in several states.
The former mayor's reasoning for entering the race was shattered by Mr. Biden's string of victories, leaving Mr. Bloomberg with no choice Wednesday morning but to drop out, according to people familiar with his decision-making.
Based on its internal data, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign saw a big shift after South Carolina, according to a campaign aide. In states where many people voted early or by mail, such as Colorado and Utah, Mr. Bloomberg performed better.
Mr. Bloomberg's momentum going into Super Tuesday was also blunted after he suffered one abysmal and one mediocre debate performance. The three-term New York mayor was grilled on the debate stage, in interviews and on the campaign trail about
stop-and-frisk
, a policing practice that his administration enforced and that a federal judge ruled was unconstitutional for violating the rights of minorities.
Mr. Bloomberg apologized for the practice before launching his White House bid and continued to do so during his campaign, including when audio of him staunchly defending the practice surfaced.
He also saw criticism over allegations of inappropriate comments toward women who worked for him at Bloomberg LP. Ms. Warren hammered him during the first Democratic debate for signing nondisclosure agreements with some of those women. Two days later, Mr. Bloomberg announced he would release three women who had made complaints against him from their agreements.
With Mr. Bloomberg bowing out of the race, the news unit of his financial data and media company announced it was casting aside restrictions that limited investigative coverage of him and his Democratic rivals. The rules had drawn criticism from Republicans because the company continued investigating Mr. Trump's administration. At times, the administration barred Bloomberg News reporters from some campaign events.
""Now that Mike has said he is leaving the race for president, we will return to our normal coverage of the election; we will follow exactly the same coverage rules for the Democratic presidential candidates and President Donald Trump,"" the news arm's editor in chief, John Micklethwait, wrote in a memo to staff.
Mr. Micklethwait said the company would add lines disclosing any financial support Mr. Bloomberg gives to other Democratic candidates to any stories about the race.

WASHINGTON -- The House delivered two articles of impeachment against President Trump to the Senate on Wednesday, after voting to approve seven Democratic managers to prosecute the case before the Republican-controlled chamber.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that she stressed litigation experience in choosing managers to handle the trial over alleged presidential abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Senators are expected to be sworn in on Thursday, and the proceedings are scheduled to get under way in earnest on Tuesday.
""The emphasis is making the strongest possible case to protect and defend our Constitution, to seek the truth for the American people,"" Mrs. Pelosi (D., Calif.) said.
""President Trump has done nothing wrong,"" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said, adding that he ""expects to be fully exonerated.""
The managers aim to advance Democrats' arguments that Mr. Trump should be removed from office. The group comprises House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of California, Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Reps. Zoe Lofgren of California, Val Demings of Florida, Sylvia Garcia of Texas and Jason Crow of Colorado.
After a brief debate, the House approved the managers, 228 to 193, almost entirely along party lines. One Democrat, Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota, broke with the party and voted against the resolution. He had also opposed both articles of impeachment. Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, an independent who left the GOP last year, supported the resolution.
The Democratic-led House voted to impeach Mr. Trump last month. The first article of impeachment stems from Mr. Trump pressing Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, including by withholding almost $400 million in aid to help Kyiv combat Russian aggression. The second article accuses Mr. Trump of impeding Congress's investigation by preventing witnesses from testifying and defying subpoenas for documentary evidence.
After the House impeached Mr. Trump, Mrs. Pelosi held off on naming the managers for nearly a month, as Democrats unsuccessfully sought guarantees from Senate Republicans that new witnesses would be heard and new evidence presented. She relented this week, after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) ratcheted up the pressure on her by signing on to a resolution to dismiss the case.
House Democratic leaders argue the delay paid off, as new emails and documents related to the case emerged in recent weeks, as well as documents showing the effort to undermine the then-U.S. ambassador to the country.
""It made sense to wait a while, as even more evidence piled up, but we have to proceed, because. . .the integrity of the election is at stake,"" said Mr. Nadler, referring to the November election.
The White House doesn't believe there is a need to hear witness testimony in the Senate trial, a senior administration official said. The official said the White House considers it ""extraordinarily unlikely"" that the trial would last longer than two weeks.
But several Republican senators, including Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, have said they would be open to hearing from new witnesses, and Mr. McConnell has ruled out a quick dismissal of the case. Witnesses sought by Democrats include former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who were directed by the White House not to testify before the House inquiry.
Votes on witnesses and documents could extend the trial beyond the two-week time frame, potentially extending it through the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3 -- the first nominating contest in the 2020 Democratic presidential race -- and Mr. Trump's State of the Union address, scheduled for Feb. 4.
Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the chamber's No. 2 Republican, said that wrapping up the trial by Mr. Trump's State of the Union address ""seems like a fairly tight deadline given what we are facing.""
Republican senators briefed on a GOP draft of rules for the trial said it likely will include a guaranteed vote on witnesses and documents after opening arguments and a period for written questions. Moderate Republicans had been pushing for such a vote, putting them at odds with Mr. Trump, who recently renewed his call to dismiss the articles without a trial.
Some GOP senators are pushing reciprocity of witnesses, so that if Democrats hear from Mr. Bolton, Republicans would push to hear from Mr. Biden's son, Hunter Biden, according to a person familiar with the matter. The younger Mr. Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company that Mr. Trump asked Ukraine's leader to investigate.
""If [Democrats] end up getting witnesses, I'm going to insist there be a motion that the president gets to call anybody deemed to be necessary to his defense,"" said Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) in an interview.
Both Bidens have denied any wrongdoing, and in the Democratic debate Tuesday night, Joe Biden called allegations from Mr. Trump ""flat-out lies.""
Mrs. Pelosi signed the articles of impeachment in a ceremony at the Capitol on Wednesday, cycling through about a dozen pens emblazoned with her name and finally handing one pen to each of the lawmakers gathered. She kept one for herself.
The House's clerk and the sergeant at arms, accompanied by all seven Democratic impeachment managers, then walked the articles to the Senate, along with a message that the House has appointed managers to exhibit the articles of impeachment.
In the Senate chamber, the camera flashes first came into view through the filigreed windows of the Senate door. At 5:34 p.m., the procession of seven House Democrats appeared at the door, met by Laura Dove, secretary for the Republicans, who signaled the group to head to the back wall.
The managers entered, single file, and walked to their places. At their desks inside the chamber, 27 Senate Democrats sat in their seats. Mr. McConnell and Sen. Kevin Cramer (R., N.D.) were in the room to bear witness.
""Mr. President, a message from the House of Representatives,"" Ms. Dove told Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), the Senate's president pro tempore, who presided over the chamber.
Mr. McConnell acknowledged the message and said the Senate will receive the managers to present the articles of impeachment at noon Thursday.
""This is a difficult time for our country, but this is precisely the kind of time for which the framers created the Senate,"" he said.
On Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts, who will preside over the trial, is to be sworn in by Mr. Grassley. Mr. Roberts is then expected to administer the same oath, to do ""impartial justice,"" to all 100 senators, who will act as the jury. At least two-thirds of the senators would have to vote to convict Mr. Trump to remove him from office.
Mr. Trump will be summoned and given time to respond. Then the Senate is expected to break for the holiday weekend before reconvening to start the trial.

Pelosi Names Seven House Lawmakers to Manage Senate Trial
Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.)
Mr. Jeffries is chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, the No. 4 leadership spot, and is widely viewed as a potential House speaker. He sits on the House Judiciary Committee, from which he had a role in the impeachment proceedings. He was initially cautious about endorsing impeaching President Trump, in contrast to the progressives on the panel who pushed earlier for the president's removal.
Sylvia Garcia (D., Texas)
Early in her career, she worked as a social worker and legal-aid lawyer. Before her election to Congress in 2018, she served as Houston City controller, Harris County commissioner and Texas state senator. Ms. Garcia also was the director and presiding judge of the Houston Municipal System. She serves on the Judiciary Committee, which drafted the impeachment articles against Mr. Trump.
Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.)
In 2019, as calls to impeach Mr. Trump grew, Mr. Nadler, the Judiciary Committee chairman, said he wanted clear evidence that would push some supporters of the president to support impeachment. Still, when the findings of the Mueller report showed Mr. Trump attempted to interfere with the investigation, he began to pursue impeachment in his committee, before the House launched a formal impeachment investigation over the Ukraine matter.
Adam Schiff (D., Calif.)
Mr. Schiff has led the impeachment investigation since it launched in September, deposing witnesses and presiding over hearings. His position on impeachment was a bellwether for many in the caucus, because he was reluctant to pursue impeachment until he became aware of a whistleblower's complaint that Mr. Trump pushed Ukraine to launch probes that could be politically beneficial to him.
Val Demings (D., Fla.)
As a member of the House Judiciary and Intelligence panels, Ms. Demings was one of the few lawmakers who questioned witnesses at every impeachment hearing. She was the first woman to lead the Orlando Police Department. When Republicans criticized holding the initial phase of the inquiry in secret, Ms. Demings drew on her law-enforcement background to argue investigations are conducted in private before the evidence is presented in public.
Zoe Lofgren (D., Calif.)
Ms. Lofgren is the No. 2 Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. She served as a staffer on the Judiciary Committee in 1974 when it voted to send articles of impeachment against President Nixon to the full House. An ally of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, she was careful about supporting impeachment, waiting until late last year to endorse the president's removal.
Jason Crow (D., Colo.)
The freshman lawmaker is a former Army Ranger who served three combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. A lawyer, he is member of the House Armed Services and Small Business committees. He joined with six other Democrats with national-security backgrounds who wrote in September that if Mr. Trump had indeed pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, it would be an impeachable offense.

WASHINGTON—The increasingly strict public-health measures designed to slow the spread of coronavirus are raising concerns about the feasibility of holding the remaining Democratic presidential primary contests, as well as the logistics of holding a November general election if the pandemic is still under way.
The nation's election system is a complicated thicket of state and federal laws. The process of selecting a presidential nominee is further complicated by the fact that political parties are private organizations and can set their own internal rules.
Depending on the jurisdiction, state officials and party leaders do have some flexibility in altering the dates and possibly the formats of the remaining presidential primary contests in response to the growing pandemic, election-law experts say. Five states have already done so—including Ohio,
where there was a brief struggle between the governor and the state supreme court
before the voting was postponed—and more may follow.
If the pandemic persists into the fall, as some public-health officials fear it could, Congress would need to step into the picture to make any significant alterations to the general election date. That date was fixed as the first Tuesday after Nov. 1 by an act of Congress in 1845 and cannot be changed—not by the president, not by state election officials—absent new legislation.
Courts have granted such strong protections to the rights of citizens to cast a ballot that even the orders of public-health officials, who have sweeping emergency authorities at all levels of government to limit gatherings or impose quarantines, could be trumped.
""While I think that states would have the authority to take reasonable measures to ensure public safety, ultimately they would have to yield to the right to vote,"" said Marc Elias, a Democratic election lawyer who has worked on numerous presidential campaigns.
The Democratic primary contest has already been affected by the virus. On Tuesday, Joe Biden defeated Bernie Sanders in
a trio of states
, but election-day turnout levels appeared to be low compared with similar contests held in the past, The Wall Street Journal reported, with
many voters venturing out of their homes for the first time in days
to cast ballots.
The pandemic may abate in coming weeks as it has in Asia, where life is slowly returning to normal in early outbreak sites like China. But if it doesn't diminish, or returns in the fall, election officials have already expressed concern about how they might hold a general election in the middle of a deadly virus outbreak—and whether an extremely low-turnout election would be seen as legitimate by the voters.
The logistics of holding in-person elections raise additional concerns. Some of the most reliable voters are elderly, a group most at risk for coronavirus complications. In addition, many of the poll workers and volunteers who staff elections across the country are older. The Election Assistance Commission found that 58% of all poll workers in 2018 were over the age of 60.

.
One proposal is for Congress to mandate that states expand vote-by-mail programs to all voters, limiting the need for in-person ballot-casting. Sens. Ron Wyden (D, Ore.) and Amy Klobuchar (D, Minn.) have proposed such a bill, which also would provide $500 million in grants to states for prepaid postage and equipment upgrades.
""Virtually every state already today has an absentee ballot arrangement. What Sen. Klobuchar and I are doing is making available a significant amount of federal funds for states to move to ensure that this fall in the middle of the pandemic, American voters are not going to be forced to choose between their health and voting,"" said Mr. Wyden on MSNBC this week.
There is ample precedent for such an action. Congress has previously mandated that all states allow military voters to cast absentee ballots by mail and that states allow voters to register while renewing or obtaining driver's licenses, for example. Thirty-four states plus Washington, D.C., allow any voter to cast a mail-in ballot for any reason; 16 place restrictions on reasons for requesting mail-in ballots.
Vote by mail is controversial, though. Some liberal activists believe that it dampens turnout among key demographic groups, and they have concerns about programs that don't include paid postage. Some conservatives have additional concerns about fraud with mail-in ballots, or simply support a single, nationwide election day.
Even opponents of universal vote-by-mail say that this year might be an exception and that it is particularly important for the 2020 balloting to be run in an orderly and legitimate way.
""Personally, I think extensive voting by mail is not a good idea. I'd hate to see using this crisis to sneak in permanent voting by mail,"" said Bradley Smith, a former Republican appointee to the Federal Election Commission who now teaches at Capital University Law School.
But for the 2020 election? ""I think it would probably be good in the current circumstances for Congress to pass limited legislation providing for some kind of vote-by-mail,"" he said.

Federal prosecutors on Tuesday accused a major political donor of obstruction of justice in connection with a federal probe into the finances of President Trump's inaugural celebration.
Imaad Zuberi, a California businessman who was a major Democratic donor before he pivoted to support Mr. Trump after the 2016 presidential election, was charged in New York federal court with impeding a federal grand jury investigation of a $900,000 donation he made to Mr. Trump's Presidential Inaugural Committee in 2016.
The new charge against Mr. Zuberi alleges that he took $50,000 from an unnamed U.S. donor and then tried to conceal the source of the funds by reimbursing the donor with a backdated check and deleting email communications between the two.
The obstruction accusation comes on top of other charges against Mr. Zuberi, announced in October, for making illegal campaign contributions, evading taxes and falsifying lobbying records.
He pleaded guilty
to those counts in federal court in Los Angeles.
The first sign that Mr. Zuberi was in legal jeopardy came when he was named in a subpoena to the Trump inaugural committee as part of a probe into foreign donations. He has since been charged with numerous campaign finance and lobbying violations beyond his donations to the inaugural committee.
Prosecutors in New York on Tuesday filed what is called a ""criminal information"" outlining the new obstruction charge against Mr. Zuberi. The New York case is expected to be transferred to Los Angeles if a judge approves. Mr. Zuberi is also expected to plead guilty to the obstruction count, according to his attorney David Kelley.
Mr. Zuberi was a major campaign contributor to mostly Democratic candidates and causes before he began donating to Mr. Trump and Republicans after the 2016 presidential election. With his status as a major donor came access to politicians—including Hillary Clinton, President Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden and others, according to photographs and court documents reviewed by the Journal and people familiar with the matter.
He used his access to politicians to drum up consulting and advocacy work from foreign governments such as Sri Lanka and Bahrain, according to prosecutors in Los Angeles. One of the earlier charges accuses him of failing to report that work to the Justice Department as required by law.
He was first named in a wide-ranging
document subpoena
issued on Feb. 4, 2019, to the Trump inaugural committee by prosecutors in New York City as part of a probe into possible foreign donations to that committee. Under federal law, only American citizens and permanent residents can contribute to most U.S. political organizations.
Mr. Zuberi's case is large by the standards of campaign finance law and is the latest in a string of prosecutions related to illegal donations in the 2016 U.S. election to candidates of both parties, sometimes involving foreign funds or an effort to cultivate foreign leaders.
Lebanese-American businessman George Nader and several others were
charged in December
with a conspiracy to funnel millions to entities supporting Mrs. Clinton's campaign. Like Mr. Zuberi, they pivoted to supporting Mr. Trump after the 2016 election.
Political consultant Sam Patten pleaded guilty in 2018 to funneling $50,000 from a Ukrainian oligarch into the Trump inaugural committee. Two businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman,
were charged
in October with engaging in political activities in the U.S. on behalf of one or more Ukrainian government officials, and have pleaded not guilty.

NASHUA, N.H.—Democrats in search of a centrist nominee to challenge President Trump are increasingly worried after contests in
Iowa
and
New Hampshire
consolidated liberal support behind Bernie Sanders and divided the larger moderate vote among multiple candidates.
The party's center lane is crowded with the rising former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Vice President Joe Biden. Looming in the
March 3 Super Tuesday states
and beyond is former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, buoyed by
campaign spending that dwarfs all his opponents combined
.
With no clear centrist front-runner, vulnerable freshman Democrats in Congress are texting each other anxiously, a Biden-allied fundraiser warns of a ""doomsday scenario"" and party strategists fret about what mixed early-state turnout means for November.
Predictions about which candidates are the most electable and which will prevail through a long primary season have proven unreliable in the past, particularly at this early stage of the process, before voting in the diverse states of South Carolina and Nevada. Barack Obama faced intraparty doubts in 2008, as did Mr. Trump in 2016.
With multiple contenders vowing to stay in the race, party leaders are yet again bracing for the likelihood of a protracted fight for the nomination that may not be settled by the time of the July convention in Milwaukee.
Adding to some Democrats' worries is the president's
acquittal from impeachment
and his strength among his most fervent supporters, as evidenced by the more than 11,000 who turned out for his
Monday night rally in Manchester, N.H.
, a larger crowd than any assembled by a Democrat campaigning in the state.
""There is one thing that's universal, and that is anxiety,"" said Rufus Gifford, who served as finance director for President Obama's re-election campaign and has contributed to several campaigns.

The fear among some Democrats is predicated on the idea that Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator and self-described democratic socialist, would struggle to defeat Mr. Trump in November. Mr. Sanders and his supporters believe the party could unite around him if he is the nominee and that he could energize young voters and those in crucial Rust Belt states who swung to the GOP in 2016.
The Sanders campaign disputed the notion he would hurt Democrats in swing districts, noting that candidates in states that will be crucial in 2020 had requested his help during 2018 midterms.
Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg, a 38-year-old newcomer to the national scene, essentially tied in Iowa and finished one-two in New Hampshire. Ms. Warren has faded in the first two contests but is pressing forward, while Ms. Klobuchar, the No. 3 finisher in New Hampshire, is eyeing delegates when her home state of Minnesota votes on March 3.
If Mr. Biden has a strong showing in South Carolina and Nevada, he could regain lost momentum and potentially persuade wavering Democrats to stick with him through subsequent states.
Mr. Bloomberg meanwhile has poured more than $350 million of his fortune into a series of March states, including California, Texas and North Carolina.
Philip Levine, a former mayor of Miami Beach, Fla., who supports Mr. Bloomberg, said in an interview he received ""an avalanche"" of phone calls and emails Wednesday from donors asking how they could help, and from elected officials, whom he didn't name, asking his advice on ""how to tactfully retract"" their endorsements of Mr. Biden and shift their support to Mr. Bloomberg.
Some Democratic donors say privately there will be a lot of pressure for Mr. Biden to get out after South Carolina if he performs poorly there.
""We are going to compete in Super Tuesday states,"" said Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a Biden campaign co-chairman. ""Bloomberg is spending an awful lot of money, but he's also not had his turn in the barrel. He has not been on the debate stage. He's untested.""
Larry Rasky, who leads a pro-Biden super PAC called Unite the Country, sought to rally Biden donors in a fundraising memo Sunday by telling them that if they hedge their bets on Mr. Biden because of Mr. Bloomberg, they could be creating a ""doomsday scenario.""
""The Sanders-Warren wing of the Party is ready for the Bloomberg fight. Democrats cannot afford a split Convention. Do you really think the Sanders voters wing will support Mike Bloomberg? Do you think all the camps who have busted their butts and played by the rules will happily sign on"" to Mr. Bloomberg's campaign, he wrote.
The party's attempt to present itself as a steady, competent alternative to Mr. Trump has been
marred by the chaotic Iowa caucuses
, where more than a week later Mr. Sanders narrowly trails Mr. Buttigieg in state delegates, but Mr. Sanders leads in the popular vote. Both candidates have requested a recanvassing of certain precincts.
Party strategists are watching early-state turnout closely for clues about whether Democrats are energized to vote.

More than 176,000 people participated in the Iowa Democratic caucuses this year, a slight increase from four years ago but well behind the nearly 240,000 who caucused in 2008. New Hampshire was a brighter spot for Democrats: Turnout reached about 297,000 voters in the Democratic primary, compared with about 255,000 in 2016 and nearly 290,000 in 2008.
""Everything is splintered,"" said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist and former adviser to West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. ""And it just shows that voters aren't falling in love with any of these candidates, and that's a problem.""
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who has conducted focus groups in early-voting states and general-election battlegrounds, said she has been struck by ""the duality of who you like and who you think can beat Trump. And they're not necessarily the same thing.""

In a sign of Democrats' interest in finding an alternative to Mr. Biden, some moderate House Democrats have embraced Mr. Bloomberg, including Reps. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Haley Stevens of Michigan and Scott Peters of California. On Wednesday, two African-American members of Congress, Reps. Lucy McBath (D., Ga.) and Gregory Meeks (D., N.Y.) said they were backing Mr. Bloomberg. All are members of the centrist New Democrat Coalition.
Rep. Stephanie Murphy, the chairwoman of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition caucus, said Mr. Sanders wouldn't be able to win over swing voters, and if he becomes the party's nominee, he could put the new House majority at risk. ""For many moderate districts and Trump-won districts, Bernie Sanders at the top of the ticket would create headwinds for house members running for re-election,"" she said.

Former Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, who supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, said in a tweet Tuesday that ""Sanders is just as polarizing as Trump AND he'll ruin our economy."" Mr. Sanders's campaign manager tweeted back: ""This is what panic from the Wall Street elite looks and sounds like.""
For most of the campaign, Mr. Biden has presented himself as the candidate best able to win states narrowly carried by Mr. Trump, including his boyhood state of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.
""He did not have a shot to win Iowa or do well in Iowa,"" said Rep. Tim Ryan (D., Ohio), who endorsed Mr. Biden after his own candidacy failed. ""His two strongest groups are communities of color and older voters, and both are pretty much excluded from the caucus process.""
Mr. Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, joined a conference call with the campaign's top financial donors on Wednesday afternoon, according to three participants, and noted the campaign's strength in Nevada and South Carolina among Latinos and African-Americans.
Polls indicate that Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar both have struggled to appeal to African-American voters. Mr. Bloomberg apologized for a second time Tuesday amid a fresh round of criticism for his support of stop-and-frisk policing in New York City.
Mr. Sanders has argued that Democrats must nominate someone who can generate enthusiasm and mobilize young people and infrequent voters who were turned off by their choices in the 2016 election. The senator has arguably the best ability to command large crowds, evidenced by more than 7,500 people who showed up for a primary eve rally and concert at the University of New Hampshire.
In the last week, Mr. Sanders has taken the lead in the RealClearPolitics average of national Democratic primary polls, after Mr. Biden had led for months.
While Mr. Biden's candidacy has foundered, Mr. Bloomberg has courted members of Congress. In January, Mr. Bloomberg flew to Salt Lake City where Rep. Ben McAdams (D., Utah) hosted the former mayor at his home with local Democrats and Republicans. Mr. Bloomberg talked about his hope for a pragmatic government and answered questions on climate change and fiscal responsibility.
Mr. McAdams said he was looking for someone he could support, but also said he was looking for someone who understood a congressional district like his own, which the president carried by 7 percentage points in 2016.
About a week later, he endorsed Mr. Bloomberg.

In a break with other tech companies, Facebook Inc. said it wouldn't limit how political advertising targets potential voters, but would instead give users tools to see fewer of those ads on its platforms.
Facebook's stance -- that companies shouldn't decide how campaigns are able to reach voters -- is at odds with other tech firms' approach to handling political advertising ahead of the 2020 election.
Operators of online platforms are under increasing pressure to curb the spread of misleading or false information in the wake of the 2016 presidential campaign, which U.S. intelligence agencies have said was subject to foreign meddling online.
Facebook's announcement Thursday highlighted the divide in opinion on what the company's role should be in elections, as critics -- including some Democratic presidential candidates -- said the latest decision leaves the door wide open for disinformation.
Facebook has acknowledged that the spread of disinformation, including through targeted ads, is a problem and has expressed a desire for federal regulation of political advertising online. But its announcement in September that it would exempt politicians' and certain other ads from its third-party fact-checking program fed skepticism about its commitment to combating disinformation on its platform.
The company based its latest decision ""on the principle that people should be able to hear from those who wish to lead them, warts and all, and that what they say should be scrutinized and debated in public,"" according to a blog post from Rob Leathern, Facebook's director of product management. ""This does not mean that politicians can say whatever they like in advertisements on Facebook.""
The post said all Facebook users have to follow its community standards, which ban hate speech, harmful content and content designed to intimidate voters or stop them from exercising their right to vote.
The company's announcement Thursday also included changes that Facebook said will boost transparency in its ad library relating to how political advertisers deploy their messages on its platforms.
Facebook's approach, including giving users more control over what they see, contrasts with moves by Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google.
Google earlier this week launched its new policy globally barring advertisers from targeting political messages based on users' interests inferred from their browsing or search histories, among other changes. Twitter stopped accepting most political ads in November.
Facebook acknowledged it considered restricting targeting but chose not to do so.
The Wall Street Journal previously reported Facebook was weighing, among other steps, raising the minimum number of people who can be targeted in political ads on its platform from 100 to a few thousand. The practice known as microtargeting has been criticized for enabling political actors to single out groups for misleading or false ads that aren't exposed to broader public scrutiny.
Facebook said its data showed more than 85% of ad spending by U.S. presidential candidates is for messages aimed at an audience of more than 250,000 people.
The social-media giant said it consulted with a number of nonprofits, political groups and election campaigns -- both Democratic and Republican -- before reaching its decision.
""Ultimately, we don't think decisions about political ads should be made by private companies, which is why we are arguing for regulation that would apply across the industry,"" Mr. Leathern said, echoing comments Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has made about the need for federal regulation of political advertising.
Reaction to Facebook's latest decision again showed divergent opinions on how the company should treat political ads.
Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said Facebook's decision not to limit targeting allows more Americans to be involved in politics. In any case, he said, there is no escaping political messaging.
""If users do elect to see fewer political ads it still won't stop them from being bombarded by ads from the news media, which are biased and just as political, because there's a loophole in the rule for the media,"" Mr. Murtaugh said.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) criticized Facebook's decision. ""Facebook is doubling down on a policy that hurts our democracy,"" the presidential candidate said in a statement that reiterated her call for comprehensive federal rules on digital political ads.
The campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden also was critical of the company. ""Today's announcement is more window dressing around their decision to allow paid misinformation,"" said campaign spokesman Bill Russo.
Roughly $3 billion is expected to be spent on political advertising online for the 2020 U.S. election. But with Election Day less than a year away, a lack of uniform rules has led to confusion about exactly what is allowed on digital platforms, how new policies will be enforced and whether advertising strategies and budgets will need to change further.
Facebook's announcement comes two days after the New York Times reported on an internal post by Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth, in which he said he believed the platform played a central role in the 2016 presidential election.
""So was Facebook responsible for Donald Trump getting elected? I think the answer is yes, but not for the reasons anyone thinks. He didn't get elected because of Russia or misinformation or Cambridge Analytica. He got elected because he ran the single best digital ad campaign I've ever seen from any advertiser. Period,"" Mr. Bosworth wrote.
Facebook said it aims to roll out its new user-control feature in the U.S. early this summer on its main platform and on Instagram.
Facebook said while its users have been able to hide all messages from a specific advertiser in their ad preferences, they soon will be able to stop seeing ads based on how an advertiser constructed its list of targeted users.

ALLENDALE, S.C.—If South Carolina is former Vice President Joe Biden's firewall against Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential primary race, interviews with black voters here indicate some cracks have formed.
Most of nearly two dozen likely voters who discussed their plans for Saturday's primary said they were trying to decide between Mr. Biden, who has long benefited from strong support from African-Americans, and billionaire Tom Steyer, who has campaigned heavily in the state.
Allendale County, tucked along the Georgia border away from the cities candidates typically focus on, carries symbolic weight in the first 2020 primary where black voters will play a significant role: It has the state's highest proportion of nonwhite voters, a Wall Street Journal analysis of state data found.
""I feel very strongly about Joe Biden, but he's making me nervous right now,"" said Lottie Lewis, a town council member here. Besides Mr. Biden, she is considering Mr. Steyer and planned to meet this week with some of his representatives.
More than three-quarters of Allendale County's roughly 5,800 registered voters are nonwhite, and U.S. census data indicates 73.8% of the county's residents are black. South Carolina's Democratic primary electorate was 61% black in 2016, exit polls showed
South Carolina's black vote isn't concentrated only in urban areas, as is the case in some other parts of the U.S. Twelve of the state's 46 counties have registered-voter populations that are more than half nonwhite, making the rural vote important in the primary.
Polling averages in the state show Mr. Biden leading, followed by Mr. Sanders and Mr. Steyer.
South Carolina is critical for Mr. Biden. He has decadeslong ties to the state and needs a win to brighten his campaign narrative after poor showings in nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire and a second-place finish in Nevada. His once-dominant lead in South Carolina polls has narrowed, and Mr. Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist from Vermont, has intensified his campaign in the state this week.
In
Tuesday night's debate in Charleston
, Mr. Biden showed no hesitation when asked whether he would win Saturday. ""I will win South Carolina,"" he said. On Wednesday,
Mr. Biden secured the important endorsement
of Rep. James Clyburn, the most influential Democrat in the state.
But Mr. Sanders has momentum after victories in Nevada and New Hampshire and a split decision in Iowa with Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind. Only one voter interviewed here mentioned Mr. Buttigieg as someone they were thinking about backing on Saturday.
Mr. Buttigieg was among the few candidates who visited Allendale County, which is an hour or more from the state's major population centers. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, who is no longer in the race, is the only other to make a stop here so far,
according to a tracker run by The Post and Courier newspaper
in Charleston.
In recent weeks, Mr. Steyer has largely had South Carolina to himself. Most of the other candidates focused more on Nevada, New Hampshire and some of the 14 states that host contests March 3. Mr. Steyer has spent more in the state on advertising than any other 2020 candidate, at $22.4 million, according to data from advertising tracker Kantar/CMAG.
Nate Hartley, a retired information technology manager who remains undecided, said he was intrigued. ""Tom Steyer has hit really hard here,"" he said. ""Every week, I get some kind of contact from him.""
Mr. Hartley said he didn't see Mr. Biden ""pulling back up from where he is"" in the race and thought Mr. Sanders was too progressive. ""Bernie wants to end capitalism,"" he said.
Patricia Johnson, a retired elementary school teacher, said she already had voted via an absentee ballot for Mr. Steyer. She said she did so, in part, because of Mr. Steyer's wealth and his potential ability to compete against President Trump in a general election. ""We all know money talks,"" she said. ""He could match Trump dollar for dollar on advertising.""
Ms. Johnson said she liked Mr. Biden but was concerned about his association with Mr. Trump's impeachment over, in part, his pressing Ukraine to investigate the former vice president's family. Mr. Trump wanted a probe into Mr. Biden's son, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian company at a time when his father was pushing anticorruption efforts there. The Bidens have denied wrongdoing.
""If he's the nominee, there would be so much drama involving Ukraine with him and Trump,"" Ms. Johnson said. ""I've had enough drama.""
In an interview, Mr. Steyer said he thought he was in second or third place in South Carolina and ""moving up."" He attributed his success with black voters to his focus on racial issues and spending more time in South Carolina than ""any other"" candidate.
""I deal explicitly with race,"" he said. ""I have a decadeslong history of working with people in the African-American community and Latino community, and actually taking part when it had nothing to do with me running for president.""
Allendale, the county seat, has seen better days. Before Interstate 95 was built in the 1960s to the east, it was a booming town along a north-south highway that moved commerce and tourists between the Northeast and Florida. It is now mostly dependent on agriculture, timber and government employment. Almost a third of residents live in poverty, double the state average.
One recent development that has brought smiles to many here was the Super Bowl win of the Kansas City Chiefs. Cornerback Bashaud Breeland attended the town's high school.

Wilbur Cave, the executive director of a housing nonprofit, said he was undecided about his vote. Mr. Steyer's commitment to the state had impressed him. ""I like that he put a lot of energy and time and resources into South Carolina,"" he said.
Pam Love, an attendance clerk at an elementary school, said she was also leaning toward supporting Mr. Steyer after seeing him speak last weekend in a neighboring county. ""I like how he reaches out to the minority community,"" she said.
Clifford Smith, a pig farmer, said he was originally a supporter of Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts before switching to Mr. Biden. He is concerned, however, about the former vice president's lackluster performance on the campaign trail. ""I don't know what his problem is,"" he said. ""It was his to lose and he's losing it.""

Nearly 380,000 more people voted in Michigan this year than in the state's 2016 Democratic primary, a 30% increase. And yet Sen. Bernie Sanders, in all-but-complete results, wound up with fewer votes than last time. Former Vice President Joe Biden, alone, benefited from the surge.
Of all the statistics arising from Mr. Biden's dominating victories in four Tuesday primaries, those numbers are among the most revealing about the Democratic Party as it sorts out its presidential nominee.
Analysts said the results signaled that Mr. Biden was unifying the party, leaving Mr. Sanders with few voter groups with which to build a competing coalition. And the big uptick in Democratic turnout, they said, suggested that Michigan likely would be tougher for President Trump than in 2016, when he carried the state by fewer than 11,000 votes.
""I don't know how you read the results any other way than that Michigan will be a more challenging state for the president,"" said Whit Ayres, a pollster and analyst whose clients have included Republican senators and presidential candidates.
Tim Murtaugh, communications director for Mr. Trump's re-election campaign, said that his coalition is growing. Mr. Trump, he said, ""has energized young voters like no other Republican candidate before him, while it's clear that Joe Biden will have a youth problem."" Exit polls showed Mr. Biden trailing Mr. Sanders by 4-to-1 among voters under age 30 in Michigan.
Mr. Biden benefited from the same surge of affluent, college-educated voters who helped revive his campaign in Super Tuesday voting last week and make him the Democratic primary front-runner. But he also won substantial victories among blue-collar voters in Michigan, the first Midwestern industrial state to vote and one of the most important battlegrounds for the fall.
While Mr. Sanders has promised to ignite a grass-roots, workers' movement, it was Mr. Biden who united the Democratic Party's professional class and its working class.
Combined with Mr. Biden's strength among black voters, the results suggest that Mr. Sanders is having trouble building support beyond his base of young voters -- a shrinking share of the voter pool, compared with 2016 -- and Hispanic voters, who didn't have a large presence in the states that voted on Tuesday.
Mr. Biden can point to Tuesday's results to support his claim to have the stronger appeal among two voting groups important to his party's prospects in November.
One is the white, working-class voters of the industrial Midwest, whom Mr. Trump moved so successfully into the GOP in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Ohio. The other group is college-educated, suburban voters who swung behind Democratic candidates in 2018 and gave them a majority in the House.
Two counties in Michigan show Mr. Biden's strength with these groups -- and how much ground Mr. Sanders has lost since his 2016 campaign.
With its cluster of hospitals and ""medical mile,"" Kent County includes Grand Rapids and has many of the voters with college and advanced degrees who are increasingly aligning with the Democratic Party. Mr. Sanders won it by 25 points in 2016. In a significant reversal, he narrowly lost the county on Tuesday.
Voting surged by 50% over 2016 levels in Kent County, but Mr. Sanders barely kept pace with his vote total from the last election.
Macomb County, outside Detroit, includes auto industry employers and many blue-collar workers. Mr. Sanders had kept the race close there in 2016, winning 47% of the vote. But he was routed on Tuesday, carrying only 35% to Mr. Biden's 51%.
Bernie Porn, president of the polling firm Epic MRA, said he believed many voters who cast ballots on Tuesday had skipped primaries in the past and voted only in general elections, an idea that can be tested in about a month, when the state updates its voter data.
Both counties backed Mr. Trump in 2016, then two years later supported Democrats for the Senate and governor.

Glitches to a mobile app and a backup phone-in plan for reporting results in Iowa's Democratic presidential caucuses delayed the outcome and heightened concerns about the integrity of the voting process in the 2020 elections.
After Monday night's failure, some Democratic Party officials in the 1,700-plus caucus sites complained about the rollout and difficulties in downloading and using the app. Some said a final version was only made available this past weekend. Still, others said that when they tried to phone results to party leaders, they were put on hold or disconnected.
The faulty kickoff led Democratic candidates to express frustration. Nevada's State Democratic Party, which holds its caucuses later this month, announced that it wouldn't use the app that malfunctioned in Iowa.
Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said the app ""did not function adequately"" and won't be used again in any future primary election contest.
The Iowa Democratic Party had been warned by security experts that the app hadn't been stress tested or vetted for statewide use. Bob Lord, the DNC's cybersecurity chief, also urged Iowa to drop plans to use the app, an overture that was ignored, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Lord declined to comment.
The Iowa Democratic Party chairman, Troy Price, said that no cyber intrusion occurred and that paper records ensure the data on results are accurate. While the data was collected accurately by the app, he said, an underlying coding error that affected how figures were reported was discovered and corrected.
""We took the steps we felt was necessary, but we found a coding error last night once we discovered some irregularities,"" Mr. Price said during an afternoon press conference held almost a full day after the caucuses began, shortly before partial results were released. Apologizing for the problems, Mr. Price promised a full, transparent investigation. ""What happened last night was simply unacceptable.""
The debacle in Iowa's first-in-the-nation nominating contest threatened to shake voter confidence in the electoral process at the start of the 2020 voting season, election and cybersecurity experts said.
""The big risk is that disruptions and uncertainty like this will be exploited to discourage people from voting,"" said Matt Blaze, an election security expert and professor of computer science at Georgetown University.
The app at the center of the controversy was built by a small Washington, D.C.-based company, Shadow Inc., the tech arm of a nonprofit progressive digital strategy firm Acronym. State records show that the Iowa Democratic Party paid Shadow a little more than $63,000 over two payments in November and December.
Shadow, in a series of tweets, apologized on Tuesday for the app's performance and said that the company ""worked as quickly as possible overnight to resolve this issue.""
Cybersecurity experts and U.S. election security officials said that while no hacking or other foul play had been detected, the app hadn't been security tested or vetted for statewide use—something Mr. Price disputed.
""Our Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency had offered to test the app,"" Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said Tuesday on ""Fox & Friends,"" the Fox network's flagship morning program. ""They declined."" Mr. Price said he wasn't aware of any offer.

Some Democratic campaigns, including those of former Vice President Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, have used a Shadow-built app to send text messages to supporters and solicit donations, according to federal campaign expense records and people familiar with the matter. The Biden campaign halted its use of that app amid concerns about its reliability.
""Our campaign used Shadow only once and on a very small scale, for sending text messages to voters about our campaign kickoff in Philadelphia,"" a Biden aide told The Wall Street Journal. ""Our IT team expressed security concerns about it, and it ultimately did not pass our cybersecurity checklist, so we declined to use it again.""
Election security became a priority for state officials, the political parties and the campaigns after the hacking of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman's email and divisive social media postings by what U.S. intelligence agencies say were Russian groups roiled the 2016 election.

In a partisan political atmosphere when elections are sometimes decided by thin margins, delays in reporting results may stoke doubt. Overhauls in many states still allow a lengthy period to complete and certify results; California, which moved its primary to early March from June, has 30 days from election day
to final certification
.
In Iowa, the confusion over the app fueled intraparty squabbling among Democrats. Supporters for Bernie Sanders, who had been leading in several polls, took to social media to revisit grievances from the 2016 election when hacked Democratic National Committee emails showed some bias by party officials in favor of Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Sanders.
Trump campaign officials also seemed to touch on Democratic divisions, questioning whether the app problems and the Iowa party's checking of the data were designed to favor a particular candidate. ""Quality control = rigged?"" tweeted Brad Parscale, manager for President Trump's re-election campaign.
Acronym distanced itself from Shadow, saying in statements that it is one of a number of investors in the company and that the two ""are distinct organizations, with separate teams of employees."" Acronym said it wasn't involved in the development of the app or in Shadow's work with the Iowa Democratic Party.
Last year, Acronym Chief Executive Tara McGowan said it was launching Shadow as part of an acquisition of a political customer-relationship management tool.
Acronym is led by Ms. McGowan, a Democratic political strategist, and has several related arms, including a political-action committee with a roughly $75 million advertising budget to target voters in swing states. She is married to a senior aide in Mr. Buttigieg's campaign, a connection that earned widespread attention on social media.
Mr. Buttigieg's campaign ""didn't have anything to do with the design of the app,"" a Buttigieg aide said, while adding the campaign's contract with the firm predates that of the Iowa Democratic Party.
Until Monday night, party officials declined to identify the app's developer. The office of Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) asked the Democratic National Committee three times about details regarding the app during the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses, but received no reply, an aide to the senator said.
Problems with the Shadow app surfaced Monday in Iowa before voting started, with some precinct leaders saying they had trouble downloading or logging onto the app. The Iowa Democratic Party said the reported issues were mainly from areas with poor cell service or involved minor user errors that were being resolved.
Some precinct officials in rural areas didn't know about the app until a few weeks ago, received no training and decided not to use it, said Tracy Freese, chair of the Democratic Party in Grundy County, who also serves as a precinct chair. She opted to call in results, as she did for previous caucuses.
Ms. Freese said she tried to get her results through on the hotline, but was put on hold and gave up after 12:30 a.m. She called back early this morning and didn't get someone on the phone until 6 a.m. Mr. Price, the Iowa Democratic Party chief, answered.
""I don't know what the hell is going on,"" she said.
The state party said last month that it would record votes from the Iowa caucuses using the smartphone app because that would be easier and faster to report results.
The app was intended to help the precinct chairs record the results from each round of voting and take care of the calculations to apportion delegates. Then the precinct chair was supposed to use the app to send the results to the Iowa Democratic Party.
But the final version wasn't ready until this past weekend, according to precinct chairs.
Joel Miller, county auditor and commissioner of elections in Cedar Rapids who volunteered to host his precinct's caucus, said he downloaded the final version of the app onto his iPhone on Saturday. When he did, he received a download link that took him to TestFlight, which is used to test new apps not ready to be shared via the Apple Store. Through TestFlight, Mr. Miller said he was able to access the vote reporting app.

Federal prosecutors on Tuesday accused a major political donor of obstruction of justice in connection with a federal probe into the finances of President Trump's inaugural celebration.
Imaad Zuberi, a California businessman who was a major Democratic donor before he pivoted to support Mr. Trump after the 2016 presidential election, was charged in New York federal court with impeding a federal grand jury investigation of a $900,000 donation he made to Mr. Trump's Presidential Inaugural Committee in 2016.
The new charge against Mr. Zuberi alleges he took $50,000 from an unnamed U.S. donor and tried to conceal the source of the funds by reimbursing the donor with a backdated check and deleting email communications between them.
The obstruction accusation comes in addition to other charges against Mr. Zuberi, announced in October, for making illegal campaign contributions, evading taxes and falsifying lobbying records. He pleaded guilty to those counts in federal court in Los Angeles.
The first sign that Mr. Zuberi was in legal jeopardy came when he was named in a subpoena to the Trump inaugural committee as part of a probe into foreign donations. He has since been charged with campaign finance and lobbying violations beyond his donations to the committee.
Prosecutors in New York on Tuesday filed a ""criminal information"" outlining the obstruction charge. The New York case is expected to be transferred to Los Angeles if a judge approves. Mr. Zuberi is expected to plead guilty to the obstruction count, according to his attorney David Kelley.
Mr. Zuberi was a campaign contributor to mostly Democratic candidates and causes before he began donating to Mr. Trump and Republicans after the 2016 presidential election. As a major donor he had access to politicians, including Hillary Clinton, President Obama, and former Vice President Joe Biden, according to photographs and court documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal and people familiar with the matter.
He used this access to drum up consulting and advocacy work from foreign governments, according to prosecutors in Los Angeles. One of the earlier charges accuses him of failing to report that work to the Justice Department.
He was first named in a wide-ranging document subpoena issued on Feb. 4, 2019, to the Trump inaugural committee by prosecutors in New York City as part of a probe into possible foreign donations to that committee. Under federal law, only American citizens and permanent residents can contribute to most U.S. political organizations.
Mr. Zuberi's case is the latest in a string of prosecutions related to illegal donations in the 2016 U.S. election to candidates of both parties.
Businessman George Nader and others were charged in December with a conspiracy to funnel millions to entities supporting Mrs. Clinton's campaign. Like Mr. Zuberi, they pivoted to supporting Mr. Trump after the 2016 election.
Consultant Sam Patten pleaded guilty in 2018 to funneling $50,000 from a Ukrainian oligarch into the Trump inaugural committee. Businessmen Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were charged in October with engaging in political activities in the U.S. on behalf of one or more Ukrainian government officials. They have pleaded not guilty.

President Trump's team has been weighing the prospects of a race against a
populist outsider or a party stalwart
. Michigan's Democratic primary may determine just what they get.
The Midwestern battleground, voting on Tuesday, is the first major general election battleground state to hold a primary. Tuesday is the first day Democrats cast a ballot since voters
whittled the race down to two candidates
a week before.
In 2016, President Trump became the first Republican to win Michigan since George H.W. Bush in 1988, eking out a victory over Hillary Clinton that was powered by strong support in white rural areas and benefited from the fact that Mrs. Clinton couldn't match former President Obama's turnout in majority-black districts.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What will you be watching for in the Michigan Democratic primary Tuesday? Join the conversation below.
In that year's Democratic nomination race, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders won the state, and he retains loyal support among young people and liberals. But former Vice President Joe Biden appears to have momentum after
a strong Super Tuesday
that showed him consolidating moderate support, and he has gathered key endorsements in the state.
While Mr. Trump remains confident he can take on either Democrat, his aides and allies have been privately pondering whom they would prefer to compete against in the general election. Some favor the contrast with Mr. Sanders's democratic socialist message—his promise to upend American politics with fundamental overhauls of the health-care and higher education systems and more. Others lean toward Mr. Biden, saying that his decades in government and record of verbal miscues offer rich opportunities for the president.
Each Democrat argues he is best equipped to defeat Mr. Trump. Mr. Sanders says he can bring to the party new voters who support his message of radical political change, while Mr. Biden's allies stress his backing among centrist suburban voters will be critical in November. Recent general election polling of head-to-head matchups with Mr. Trump in Michigan show both Democrats ahead of the president.
For weeks, Mr. Trump and his associates had openly been agitating for Mr. Sanders, with the president seeking to stir up the Vermont senator's supporters by claiming without evidence the Democratic establishment had fixed the race for Mr. Biden. But Trump team's focus turned to Mr. Biden again after Super Tuesday. A key question is whether Mr. Biden can bring back to the Democratic fold voters in the Rust Belt states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which Mr. Trump swept in 2016 to take the White House, as well as compete in historic swing states like Florida.
""I'll tell you, I was all set for Bernie, because I thought it was going to happen,"" Mr. Trump said during a Fox News town hall Thursday. ""In a certain way Bernie would be tougher because he's got a base,"" he said, but added, ""I think it's going to be very hard for him to come back.""
Some Democratic voters in Detroit and its suburbs said they preferred a contest between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden, fearing Mr. Sanders's suite of policy proposals are too far to the left.
""I'm happy with Biden getting stronger. Bernie has a lot of good criticisms to make, but I still feel like in my heart Biden is our best choice,"" said Sara Frank, 69 years old, a retiree from West Bloomfield. ""He would have a broader reach.""
Aaron Parks, 24, who works in the health insurance industry, backed Mr. Sanders in 2016 but this year said he is supporting Mr. Biden. He said when he knocked on doors for Mr. Sanders in Commerce Charter Township four years ago, he found resistance to his liberal policies.
""What I like most about [Mr. Biden] is he's going to resonate with people around here,"" he said.
But Megan Hakala, 31, who works at Wayne State University and lives in Garden City, said if Democrats chose Mr. Biden, Mr. Trump could beat him in Michigan.
""He just doesn't have the passion. I have not met anyone, personally, who is fired up about Biden the way people are fired up about Bernie,"" she said. ""I think that the passion has to be there for the Democratic candidate in order to beat Trump.""
Michigan, which offers 125 delegates to the Democratic convention awarded proportionately, could prove a critical moment in the primary race, either as the state in which Mr. Biden solidifies his march to the nomination or where a strong victory enables Mr. Sanders to remain competitive.
Mr. Sanders has said a loss in Michigan's primary won't force him out of the race, and he has made an aggressive push in Michigan in the final days before the primary, canceling events in other states to add extra stops there. Mr. Biden didn't get to the state until Monday. Later, he is expected to appear with California Sen. Kamala Harris, who
endorsed him Sunday
, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who announced his backing Monday. Meanwhile, Mr. Biden has sent surrogates including Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and has key backers in the state, including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
Heading into Tuesday, Mr. Sanders has begun to criticize Mr. Biden's trade record more forcefully, hitting his support for trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement. His aides feel the criticism resonates with Michigan's large union population and would be a powerful general election argument. They argue Mr. Trump won Michigan and other Midwest states in part because he focused on the trade deals.
""If we are going to defeat Trump in Michigan, in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin it will be very hard for a candidate who voted for these disastrous trade agreements,"" Mr. Sanders said at a rally in Detroit on Friday night. The campaign also released ads targeting Mr. Biden on trade.
Mr. Biden is expected to focus on his record as vice president while trying to avoid a back-and-forth with Mr. Sanders. He likely also will emphasize his role in the 2009 bailout of General Motors Co. and Chrysler, as well as the Affordable Care Act, issues that he would likely continue to stress in a general election. His aides said his strong showing in suburban swing districts on Super Tuesday show he will be competitive in Michigan.
One Biden adviser said, ""Vice President Biden has actually been on two presidential tickets that won Michigan.""
Whichever Democrat wins on Tuesday, the president's campaign said trade will be an issue in the fall. Campaign manager Tim Murtaugh said that Mr. Trump will have an advantage against either, arguing that ""Joe Biden voted for the job-killing Nafta, and Bernie Sanders voted against its much-improved replacement,"" the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA.
The president's campaign—which has pumped resources into Michigan since 2016 to remain competitive—has sought to depict all the Democratic contenders as too far left for many Americans. From the White House on Friday, Mr. Trump made that case against Mr. Biden.
""He's left wing and he's got all people that are left wing. And in many ways, he's worse than Bernie,"" Mr. Trump said.
Mr. Trump also made clear this week that he will continue to raise questions about Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden and their dealings with Ukraine. No evidence has surfaced of any wrongdoing on the part of either Biden, and Mr. Trump was impeached in the Democratic-majority House for pressing the country to announce investigations that would benefit him politically in this year's election, including a probe of the former vice president. He was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate.
""That will be a major issue in the campaign,"" Mr. Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Wednesday, speaking about the Bidens and Ukraine.
Michigan Democrat Michael Frank, 70, a dermatologist from West Bloomfield who is supporting Mr. Biden, said he was worried about Mr. Trump reviving these attacks, but said ""I think there's enough animosity for Trump out there now.""

Joe Biden swept to victories in the key state of Michigan along with Missouri and Mississippi in Tuesday's round of presidential nominating contests, building his delegate lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders with a coalition of African-Americans, suburbanites and older voters.
Opening a new phase in the race, the former vice president put distance between himself and Mr. Sanders -- and built upon his momentum from wins in 10 Super Tuesday stateslast week.
Mr. Biden quickly sought to unite the party after prevailing in Michigan, which offered 125 delegates, the biggest prize of the night. The results in Washington, the second-biggest delegate haul of the day, were too close to call. North Dakota and Idaho were also holding contests.
""I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion,"" Mr. Biden told supporters in Philadelphia. ""We share a common goal and together, we'll defeat Donald Trump, we'll defeat him together.""
Mr. Biden has presented himself as the Democrat best able to challenge President Trump in general-election battlegrounds such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, which was the first of those states to weigh in on the Democratic race. His win there, by one measure, is his most significant yet and could bolster his argument that he should be the party's nominee.
With 64% of Michigan precincts reporting, Mr. Biden had about 53% of the vote to about 38% for Mr. Sanders.
Mr. Biden was projected the winner in Mississippi and Missouri by the Associated Press shortly after the states' polls closed, an early sign of his clout in two states with large African-American voting blocs.
Black voters made up about two-thirds of the electorate in Mississippi, according to exit polls. Mr. Biden had won more than 80% of support in the state, with 89% of precincts reporting.
Mr. Biden, who served under President Obama, campaigned ahead of the Missouri primary among African-Americans in St. Louis and Kansas City. With 93% of precincts reporting, Mr. Biden had about 60% of the vote in Missouri.
Mr. Sanders returned to his home in Burlington, Vt., and did not speak publicly after the election results. A campaign aide said he intended to participate in Sunday's debate in Phoenix.
Mr. Biden entered Tuesday with a delegate edge of 670 to 574 over Mr. Sanders, according to a Wall Street Journal delegate tracker, even as Super Tuesday states such as California and Colorado, which Mr. Sanders carried, continue to process election results.
Mr. Sanders was seeking to steady his campaign after Mr. Bidenconsolidated the support of party moderates following his victory in the South Carolina primary last month. Some in the party's establishment have expressed fears that Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who won the New Hampshire and Nevada contests, would be too liberal for many voters in the general election.
The campaigns competed for votes against the backdrop of growing economic concerns over the spread of the coronavirus.
Messrs. Sanders and Biden both canceled rallies in Cleveland Tuesday, ahead of Ohio's primary next week, citing public-health concerns. Both candidates havequestioned Mr. Trump's handling of the crisisin recent days. The Democratic National Committee also said it would have no live audience at the Phoenix debate, in response to concerns about the outbreak.
Exit polls showed Mr. Biden winning handily among black and older voters and performing well with voters who had at least a college degree. Mr. Biden was also prevailing in cities such as St. Louis, Kansas City and Detroit and in their surrounding suburban areas, including Oakland County, Mich.
Mr. Sanders was maintaining a substantial advantage over Mr. Biden among young voters, exit polls showed, more evidence that the former vice president would need to improve his standing with that group if he became the party's nominee.
The Vermont senator has staked much of his campaign on motivating the young -- and others disenchanted with current politics -- to come to the polls.
Mr. Sanders went into Tuesday with high hopes for Michigan, where he narrowly defeated the eventual nominee, Hillary Clinton, in 2016. Mr. Trump beat Mrs. Clinton in the state in the general election, becoming the first Republican to carry Michigan since 1988.
Michigan's secretary of state warned that the full results might not be known until Wednesday due in part to a spike in absentee-ballot requests.
In Michigan on Tuesday, Mr. Biden defended his support of the Second Amendment in a heated exchange with an auto worker and later spoke of the Obama administration's bailout of General Motors and Chrysler, two titans of the state's auto industry, more than a decade ago.
""We bet on you,"" Mr. Biden said during a visit to a Fiat Chrysler assembly plant in Detroit. ""If I end up being the president, you'll never have a better friend in the White House.""
During a Detroit rally on the eve of the primary, Mr. Biden was joined by Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, two former presidential rivals who recently endorsed Mr. Biden's candidacy.
The pair -- who have been discussed by some Democrats as potential running mates for Mr. Biden if he wins the nomination -- could help him appeal to black voters in the state.
Mr. Sanders courted voters at a Dearborn Heights, Mich., polling place on Tuesday, repeating criticisms he has raised about Mr. Biden's record, including the former Delaware senator's past support for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Mr. Sanders told reporters that Michigan was ""obviously a very important state"" but that he thinks every state is important to try to win.
""When our record is compared to Biden's, when our vision is compared to Biden's, when we have that debate in Phoenix, I'm feeling pretty good,"" Mr. Sanders said.
Tuesday's contests served as the first opportunity for voters to consider a one-on-one choice between Messrs. Biden and Sanders after other candidates dropped out. In the last two weeks, billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg all exited the race and endorsed Mr. Biden.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii) was still seeking the nomination but has been unable to break out of single-digit percentages in polling.
Mr. Biden has largely sought to avoid confrontation with Mr. Sanders.
But in his stump speech, the former vice president has pointed out that it is he, and not the senator, who has so far driven up turnout in primaries.
""Sen. Sanders likes to say, 'We need a record turnout to beat Donald Trump.' He's absolutely right,"" Mr. Biden has told audiences in recent days, rattling off Super Tuesday turnout boosts in Virginia, Texas and North Carolina.
""Guess who they voted for? They voted for us,"" Mr. Biden said.

WASHINGTON—No rallies. No handshakes. No in-person fundraisers. And a whole lot of uncertainty.
The coronavirus pandemic
fundamentally has altered
the 2020 presidential race, forcing Democratic presidential campaigns to prepare for weeks of out-of-the-box appeals to voters, a reliance on digital events and a major adjustment to the national shutdown of daily life.
The
spread of the virus
, which has closed schools and workplaces and roiled financial markets, prompted
Louisiana to postpone
its April 4 primary until June 20. The decision announced Friday coincided with the campaigns of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders curtailing, for the foreseeable future, the kind of retail politics that has marked every modern White House campaign.
""In the annals of U.S. history, the 2020 presidential campaign and coronavirus crisis will be deeply intertwined,"" said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. ""You're not going to be able to extract one from the other.""
Mr. Biden, the former vice president and front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, conducted his first ""virtual town hall"" with supporters in Illinois on Friday in what his team expected to be a ""reimagining"" of events aimed at maintaining his momentum. It followed decisions by his campaign to scrap public events this week in Ohio, Florida and Illinois.
But the live stream had audio and technical difficulties as Mr. Biden fielded questions on health care and the endangered-species act. ""I'm sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the connections,"" Mr. Biden said, speaking into an iPhone with an American flag and an Illinois one in the backdrop.
Mr. Biden hasn't been tested for the coronavirus and hasn't displayed any symptoms, such as fever, cough or shortness of breath, consistent with the virus, his public-health advisory committee said Friday night in a statement.
Mr. Sanders said Friday in a live-streamed speech in Burlington, Vt., that the virus had significantly affected his campaign, preventing him from holding his signature large rallies. ""It has radically changed our campaign,"" the Vermont senator said.
Mr. Sanders said the campaign's ""internet capabilities"" and broad social-media following are an asset. But he acknowledged: ""We are in the process of thinking this through.""
President Trump has canceled some events and doesn't have his next major campaign rally scheduled. He isn't facing serious opposition to winning the Republican nomination to seek re-election in November.
The Trump re-election campaign said Friday evening it would build on its existing digital tools and would train new volunteers using call-from-home applications next week.
Mr. Sanders also said he hasn't been tested for the virus and hasn't displayed any symptoms. He called upon Mr. Trump—who had contact recently with a Brazilian official who tested positive for the virus—to get tested and to release the results publicly.
The virus has disrupted the Democratic campaign as Mr. Biden has built a delegate lead of 878-725 over Mr. Sanders, according to a Wall Street Journal delegate tracker, giving the former vice president an inside track to the party's nomination.
The campaigns are preparing for primaries Tuesday in four states: Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. Georgia's primary is planned for March 24.
Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders are scheduled to appear in Sunday's
11th presidential debate
, which was moved from Phoenix to Washington, D.C., because of the virus. The debate will be held at CNN's studios near the U.S. Capitol without a live audience.
Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders are shuttering their headquarters and asking staff to work from home. Mr. Biden has been based at his home in Wilmington, Del., since Wednesday and addressed the pandemic Thursday at a hotel near his residence.
Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, has remained at his home in Burlington in recent days, but plans to stay at his Washington, D.C., residence after Sunday's debate to work in the Senate, said his wife, Jane O'Meara Sanders.
The campaigns are no longer conducting door-to-door canvassing. Mr. Biden's campaign said in a memo Thursday that it would organize voters through ""phone-banking, text messaging, virtual events, other distributed organizing models.""
Digital organizing firm Mobilize, which is used by both Messrs. Biden and Sanders, has seen an increase in events moving to virtual from in-person, said Alfred Johnson, the firm's chief executive and co-founder.
In-person events typically account for three-quarters of activities. But Mr. Johnson said that 85% of volunteer or supporter sign-ups on Friday have been tied to virtual events, such as phone banking or virtual town halls.
The candidates haven't held in-person campaign events with voters since Tuesday.
The virus also has scrambled the work of voter registration. Quentin James, president of Collective Future, a group focused on registering black voters, said he has put hiring field staffers on hold. The group, which recently received $2 million from billionaire former presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg, had planned to use digital platforms to register voters, but the outbreak prompted it to focus its strategy solely around that, Mr. James said.
Traditional fundraising has been drastically changed, with Mr. Biden's campaign shifting to ""virtual fundraisers."" The campaign canceled in-person events that had been scheduled for Chicago, Miami Beach, Fla., and New York in the next week.
Donors who had planned to attend a fundraiser on Monday at the Miami Beach home of Alexander and Tiffany Heckler, for example, received an email telling them that Mr. Biden wanted to hold a conference call to thank them and ""answer some questions from the group.""

Mr. Sanders doesn't hold large fundraisers, preferring instead to focus on raising money online from small donors. That tactic and digital marketing are taking on more prominent roles in the campaigns. But political consultants said campaigns should be mindful of how they raise money.
""Even though there are candidates and organizations that are still fundraising, we want to be careful of our phrasing so that we're being sensitive to the situation, not increasing anxiety or causing misunderstandings, and also not being tone deaf,"" said Loren Merchan, a partner at the political firm Authentic Campaigns, which worked on California Sen. Kamala Harris's presidential bid.
""We've really never seen anything like this in the era of digital,"" Ms. Merchan said.
Mr. Brinkley, the presidential historian, said the focus on the virus likely would elevate public health as a campaign issue, along with Mr. Trump's handling of the crisis. It may also change the nature of retail politics, at least for now, he said.
""The days of kissing babies and shaking hands are over for a while,"" he added.

After more than a year of heated Democratic debate about health care, climate change and more, the 2020 candidates are making their final pushes in Iowa squarely about beating President Trump.
That emphasis comes as Iowa voters—much like Democrats across the U.S.—express anxiety about making sure they pick a nominee who could unseat Mr. Trump.
""There's people who feel like, you know, there's the more moderate, quote unquote, part of the party who might be more electable,"" Rowen Schussheim, a college art professor from Davenport, told Elizabeth Warren at a campaign event Sunday. ""What would you say to us?""
Ms. Warren, a senator and one of four candidates who consistently polls near the front of the pack in early states, didn't beat around the bush. ""I know how to fight and I know how to win,"" she said.
Then, she leaned into an issue that has been following her on the campaign trail in recent weeks: ""Can we just address it right here?"" Ms. Warren said. ""Women win.""
Ms. Warren has been forcefully advocating that women are electable, a key part of her closing pitch in Iowa following
a public disagreement
with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Ms. Warren has said Mr. Sanders told her during a 2018 meeting that a woman couldn't beat Mr. Trump. Mr. Sanders has vehemently denied the account, and the pair have tried to move on. Ms. Warren launched a new television ad Monday in Iowa titled: ""Why She Will Beat Him.""
Ms. Schussheim, in an interview after Ms. Warren's remarks in Davenport, said the senator responded to her electability question well, but she still hadn't determined whether she would caucus for her on Feb. 3.
""I still am concerned that independents and independent-thinking Republicans won't vote for Sanders or Warren because the other side is going to call it socialist,"" she said. Ms. Warren has also been pitching herself as the candidate who bridges the divide in the party between liberals and centrists.
Mr. Sanders, on the other hand, isn't trying to assuage concerns of the party's centrist wing. Instead, he spent the weekend pitching himself as the candidate best positioned to beat Mr. Trump because of his emphasis on mobilizing the progressive base and what he says is his ability to bring new voters into the party.
One of a handful of standing ovations he got during a rally in Ames Saturday night came when he said his campaign was taking on the Democratic establishment.
""If you think that it is absolutely imperative that we defeat Donald Trump, take a hard look at what our campaign is about,"" he said. ""I think you'll conclude that our campaign is the strongest campaign.""
Although the race has been fluid in Iowa, recent polls showed him atop the Democratic field in that state and New Hampshire, which will hold its primary Feb. 11. (Another recent Iowa poll showed former Vice President Joe Biden leading.) Sanders aides also point to head-to-head polling showing him ahead of Mr. Trump nationally and in many swing states. At campaign events over the weekend, his supporters wore buttons that read ""Bernie beats Trump.""
""I think people are going to keep turning out, I think we're going to keep building momentum and I think we're going to win the state and the nomination and then the election after that,"" said Jessi Turner, a 34-year-old veterinarian from Ames.
Mr. Biden said in Iowa this week that he has proven resilient against criticism from Mr. Trump and Republicans. The president's impeachment trial stems in part from allegations that Mr. Trump pressured Ukrainian leaders to investigate Mr. Biden and his son Hunter. Mr. Biden has long said that effort by Mr. Trump shows he fears facing the former vice president in the November general election.
""I hope I've demonstrated that I can take a punch,"" he said.
He also warned an Iowa audience that other candidates were offering expensive proposals (he did not specify which rivals or policies he was talking about), which he said ""scares the living devil out of people.""
Mr. Biden has campaigned alongside a group of congressional Democrats who represent swing districts that helped the party recapture the House in 2018. The lawmakers tell audiences that having Mr. Biden atop the ticket would help the party keep control of the House and peel off moderate voters who backed Mr. Trump in 2016.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Which candidate's closing argument do you think is most effective? Why? Join the conversation below.
Freshman Rep. Colin Allred (D., Texas) during a Sunday event in Marshalltown said Mr. Biden could help put his longtime Republican state in play. ""We need you from the frozen fields of Iowa to send Joe Biden to Texas,"" he said.
Pete Buttigieg pitched himself as the party's best chance of beating Mr. Trump. ""I think I can do better than the competition,"" he said at a county fairgrounds in Boone.
The 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Ind., reminded his audience that when Democrats have won the White House in the modern era, it has been when their nominee was a candidate new to the national scene, not closely tied to Washington and young enough to represent a new generation. ""That's how we can excite people around the need for change,"" he said.
Like Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg is also attempting to appeal to independents and even some Republicans. He appeared Sunday at a town hall event in Iowa sponsored by Fox News, where he sought to reach out to what he often refers to as ""future former Republicans.""
Republicans and independents can participate in the Democratic caucuses if they change their party registration.

NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C.—Terry Alexander says four years ago, many black Democrats here had never heard of Bernie Sanders.
Mr. Alexander, a state lawmaker, said the Vermont senator told him at the time that he faced an uphill battle against Hillary Clinton in South Carolina's primary, the first in the Democratic nominating calendar where the electorate is majority black. ""It was very obvious,"" Mr. Alexander recalled in a recent interview. ""And no one knew him down here.""
In the days leading up to
South Carolina's 2020 primary Saturday
, Mr. Sanders and his team were confident this time would be different. His name recognition was higher, he had more staff on the ground here, and the race lacked a stable front-runner, with former Vice President Joe Biden struggling in the
first two nominating contests.

But Mr. Sanders lost again here—badly—serving a blow to a candidate who was on the rise and rekindling notions that he will again be unable to pull a large chunk of black voters, a core Democratic constituency, into what he calls his political revolution.
Mr. Sanders's nearly 30-point differential with Mr. Biden was closer than in 2016, when Mr. Sanders lost by 48 points to Mrs. Clinton. He lost black voters by 45 points, according to
exit polls
.
This cycle, the Sanders campaign believed he would narrow the margin in South Carolina. But after Mr. Sanders's strong performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, the campaign saw a path to victory in the state.
Mr. Sanders told reporters traveling with him in mid-February that he had a shot at winning here. The same day, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found Mr. Biden—who had long led the field among black Democrats—had
lost a substantial chunk of that support and was running about even
with Mr. Sanders nationally. Entrance polls in the Nevada caucuses showed Mr. Sanders only about 10 points behind Mr. Biden with black voters there.
Interviews with Mr. Sanders' surrogates, aides and advisers, and black Democrats in South Carolina suggest the Vermont senator made more effort to win the state in 2020 than in 2016. Former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, co-chair of Mr. Sanders's campaign and a prominent surrogate for him in South Carolina during both cycles, said the senator started visiting earlier this time, even before he announced he was running for president.
Mr. Sanders employed roughly 70 staffers throughout the state for the 2020 cycle—double his on-the-ground presence in 2016. State director Michael Wukela described this year's staff as ""significantly more diverse, significantly more from South Carolina"" than the staff Mr. Sanders put here in 2016. This year, some 90% of the staff are from the state, and 83% are nonwhite.
At one field office Wednesday in North Charleston, Victoria Felder, a regional field director, said she saw a sharp increase in volunteers after his strong showings in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. ""It's crazy,"" she said. ""This wasn't what was going on just two months ago.""
Sharnice Williams, a 25-year-old nurse from North Charleston, was raking leaves in her yard a few days before the Saturday primary when a Sanders volunteer approached her and went through the bullet points on Mr. Sanders' plan to cancel all student loan debt.
""I am going to go out there and support Mr. Sanders,"" Ms. Williams said emphatically. Asked by a reporter if she had been considering Mr. Biden, Ms. Williams said she had been. But she changed her mind after hearing about Mr. Sanders's loan-debt forgiveness proposal.
Still, some black voters who didn't support Mr. Sanders said in interviews that they didn't back him because they were looking for a candidate who would provide stability, rather than a revolution. Others worried he was too liberal to win a general election against President Trump. Mr. Biden also has gotten support because of his service as vice president alongside President Obama.
When he held campaign events throughout the state the week before the primary, Mr. Sanders drew mostly white crowds.
Interviews with black voters at Sanders events in the two days leading up to the South Carolina primary found that some were considering backing him, but were still looking at other candidates, particularly Mr. Biden.
Most of Mr. Sanders' black supporters interviewed by the Journal hadn't heard from the Sanders campaign other than receiving emails they had subscribed to. They showed up at his events because they heard about them on the news or through work, not because a volunteer or staffer contacted them.
Fred Brisbane, who is from North Charleston and works in mortuary transportation, said he would vote for Mr. Biden.
""I like the organization,"" Mr. Brisbane, 69, said as he walked into his polling place. He said he respected Ms. Turner and liked that Mr. Sanders had earned her support. ""But I think he's a little too, I guess you could say, liberal for me.""

Confusion and frustration buffeted Democratic Party officials and activists in Iowa on Tuesday after a new mobile app and a backup phone-in plan for reporting results malfunctioned, delaying the outcome from the first-in-the-nation Democratic presidential caucuses.
After Monday night's failure, some officials in the 1,700-plus caucus sites complained about difficulties in downloading and using the app. Others said that when they tried to phone results to party leaders, they were put on hold or disconnected.

The faulty kickoff
to the Democratic presidential primary threatened to shake voter confidence in the electoral process, election and cybersecurity experts said. It occurred despite warnings from those experts that the app hadn't been security tested or vetted for statewide use.
The app was built by a small Washington, D.C.-based company called Shadow Inc., the tech arm connected to nonprofit progressive digital strategy firm Acronym, according to people familiar with the matter. State records show that the Iowa Democratic Party paid Shadow a little more than $63,000 over two payments in November and December. Shadow describes itself as a company that builds ""affordable and easy-to-use tools"" for progressives, according to its website.
Shadow apologized on Tuesday for the app's performance.
""We sincerely regret the delay in the reporting of the results of last night's Iowa caucuses and the uncertainty it has caused to the candidates, their campaigns, and Democratic caucus-goers,"" the company wrote in a series of tweets, adding that ""we worked as quickly as possible overnight to resolve this issue.""
In a statement Tuesday, Troy Price, the chair of the Iowa Democratic Party, said that he didn't have any evidence of a cyber intrusion into ""our systems"" and that these had been tested by ""independent cybersecurity consultants."" The statement didn't specify which systems Mr. Price was referring to. The Iowa Democratic Party declined to provide more detail.
Mr. Price said that an investigation into the app found that data was being recorded accurately but ""reporting out only partial data"" due to a coding issue that had since been fixed. Paper backups of caucus tabulations have allowed the party to verify results, Mr. Price said.
""While our plan is to release results as soon as possible today, our ultimate goal is to ensure that the integrity and accuracy of the process continues to be upheld,"" Mr. Price said. During a conference call early Tuesday, campaigns were told some results might be released as early as 5 p.m. EST.
Until Monday night, party officials declined to identify the app's developer and, according to people familiar with the matter, the app wasn't subject to sufficient security and reliability testing. The office of Sen. Ron Wyden (D.-Ore.,) asked the Democratic National Committee three times about details regarding the app during the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses, but received no reply, an aide to the senator said.

Cybersecurity experts and U.S. election security officials said that they hadn't seen signs of hacking or other foul play related to the app's troubled performance. Even so, the app debacle occurring in the first contest of the 2020 primary season threatens to erode voter confidence and raises questions about the integrity of voting systems.
""The big risk is that disruptions and uncertainty like this will be exploited to discourage people from voting,"" said Matt Blaze, an election security expert and professor of computer science at Georgetown University.
The hacking of Hillary Clinton's campaign by what U.S. intelligence agencies say was a group linked to Russia's military and divisive social media postings by other Russian groups roiled the 2016 election. One result was a heightened concern among election officials and the campaigns about cybersecurity and disinformation.

Some Democratic campaigns, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, have used a Shadow-built app to send text messages to supporters and solicit donations, according to federal campaign expense records and people familiar with the matter. The Biden campaign halted its use of that app amid concerns about its reliability.
""Our campaign used Shadow only once and on a very small scale, for sending text messages to voters about our campaign kickoff in Philadelphia,"" a Biden aide told The Wall Street Journal. ""Our IT team expressed security concerns about it, and it ultimately did not pass our cybersecurity checklist, so we declined to use it again.""
Nevada's State Democratic Party had planned to use the Shadow app in its caucuses later this month. The state party paid $58,000 to Shadow in August, according to Federal Election Commission records. In a statement Tuesday, the party said it would ""not be employing the same app or vendor used in the Iowa caucus.""
In statements Monday and Tuesday, Acronym distanced itself from Shadow, saying it is one of a number of investors in the company and that the two ""are distinct organizations, with separate teams of employees."" Acronym said it wasn't involved in the development of the app or in Shadow's work with the Iowa Democratic Party. Last year, Acronym's Chief Executive Tara McGowan said it was launching Shadow as part of an acquisition of a political customer-relationship management tool.
Acronym is led by Ms. McGowan, a Democratic political strategist, and has several related arms, including a political-action committee with a roughly $75 million advertising budget to target voters in swing states.
Problems with the shadow app surfaced Monday in Iowa before voting started, with some precinct leaders saying they had trouble downloading or logging onto the app. The Iowa Democratic Party said the reported issues were mainly from areas with poor cell service or involved minor user errors that were being resolved.

Some precinct officials in rural areas didn't know about the app until a few weeks ago, received no training and decided not to use it, said Tracy Freese, chair of the Democratic Party in Grundy County, who also serves as a precinct chair.
""We weren't going to chance it,"" Ms. Freese said, adding she always planned on using the phone hotline, as she has done for previous caucuses.
By the time caucus-goers gathered, frustrations climbed. Some precinct chairs struggled to transmit caucus results, both via the smartphone app and by a backup telephone system.
Ms. Freese said she tried to get her results through on the hotline last night, but she was put on hold and gave up after 12:30 a.m. She called back early this morning and didn't get someone on the phone until 6 am. Mr. Price, the Iowa Democratic Party chief, answered.
""I don't know what the hell is going on,"" she said.
The state party said last month that it would record votes from the Iowa caucuses
using the smartphone app
because that would be easier and faster to report results from some 1,700 caucus sites.
The app was intended to help the precinct chairs record the results from each round of voting and take care of the calculations to apportion delegates. Then the precinct chair was supposed to use the app to send the results to the Iowa Democratic Party.
The cybersecurity wing of the Department of Homeland Security recently offered to do some security testing on the app but the Iowa Democratic Party declined the outreach, according to people familiar with the matter.
""Our Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency had offered to test the app,"" said Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said Tuesday on ""Fox & Friends,"" the Fox network's flagship morning program. ""They declined."" Mr. Wolf said that no malicious activity had taken place but said public confidence could be harmed regardless.
Monday's challenges were the latest example of the perils that can result when new technology is introduced to the voting process. Though digitized election equipment offers to streamline vote tabulation and reporting, it also may bring unforeseen vulnerabilities, such as faulty touch screens or registration databases that can be hacked.
Last summer, the Iowa Democratic Party
dropped plans to allow
voting by phone—so-called ""virtual caucuses""—after the party's national committee objected to the proposal amid security concerns.
The Democratic National Committee walked back the announcement of a suspected attempt to hack its voter database in 2018 after it learned an apparent email intrusion
was a false alarm
set off in a cybersecurity test.

Now that Bernie Sanders -- once an obscure socialist senator from Vermont -- is officially the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, it is time to confront what that means.
It does not mean the U.S. is flirting with socialism. That's not going to happen. The meaning of Bernie's ascent is that the Democratic Party, older even than he is, has simply run out of gas.
The Democrats resemble Europe's aging political parties -- Britain's Labour, France's Socialists, Germany's Social Democrats and Christian Democrats. All have simply deflated with voters.
Signs of public fatigue with the Democrats could be seen in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Besides incompetence, the big story out of Iowa was low turnout. In New Hampshire the story was voter indecision. Once past Bernie's 25% cement-block base, many voters were flipping a coin in the voting booth to pick from the other candidates.
What does it mean that Elizabeth Warren, by now a household name, got dropped to fourth place? Joe Biden's humiliating fifth is a personal disaster, but what does that say about the party itself?
Circling overhead is Mike Bloomberg, supposedly the party's savior. The truth is Barack Obama was the party's final savior, and a second coming isn't likely. Recall the talk after the 2016 election about how the Democrats had ""no bench."" They just rolled benchless into 2020.
The Democrats' floundering to find a candidate is deeper than the split between moderates and the left. It looks to me like the accumulated costs of its long history as the self-declared party of government are finally coming due.
The party's problem is that it doesn't look competent anymore. The Iowa caucus debacle came on top of the Trump impeachment, another low-turnout event with the public. People began telling reporters that the three-year death struggle between Democrats and President Trump wasn't their idea of Washington's purpose.
So what, other than hunting Donald Trump, does the Democratic Party stand for?
A recurring argument of this column is that in the U.S. and Europe, the presumed efficiency of governments has been worn down by the programs and responsibilities they've created for themselves, some with good intentions. By now, it's just too much.
During the Depression, Franklin Roosevelt struck a defining bargain with the public: Cede to the government expanded powers over the details of American life, and government will administer it efficiently. For the public, giving government the power to regulate and rule was supposed to be a net plus.
The bargain behind Bernie Sanders's Medicare for All, funded by new taxes on the middle class, is that it too will be a net plus. Come Election Day in November, will 50% of the electorate actually believe Democrats today could competently administer a national health-care system in the U.S.?
Mr. Sanders, who filed as a Democrat for this election, isn't that much of an outlier. All his rivals, including the ""moderates,"" are proposing more additions to the already massive government labyrinth they've built for decades.
But in those places where the modern Democratic Party is in charge, they often govern badly or incompetently on a grand scale. Misgovernance related to crime, homelessness, poor schools and affordability has become the symbol of Democratic control in large U.S. cities such as New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Baltimore, Chicago and St. Louis.
U.S. census data shows people voting with their feet, moving out of the Northeast and Far West into the less bureaucratized Southern and Mountain states. A major reason for these internal refugee flows is that Democratic legislatures and city councils -- New York, Seattle, San Francisco -- reflexively pass progressive policies disconnected from commercial or social reality.
Mike Bloomberg's experience as a Democratic presidential candidate is a case study in the party's flight from basic competence.
The former Republican New York City mayor is running on his record of proven ability, first building his company from nothing into greatness, then running a complex city. But party dogma has forced Mr. Bloomberg to disavow stop-and-frisk, one of the policies that restored order to New York amid a crime crisis.
That success secured Mr. Bloomberg's reputation as a competent public manager. Under his Democratic successor, the progressively pure Bill de Blasio, crime is rising again, along with a generalized sense of administrative incompetence.
Joe Biden tried to run on a greatest hits of legislation. It didn't sell. Elizabeth Warren detailed her expansions of FDR-like government, and voters ran from it.
Look at who's No. 1 and 2. Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg. One is 78, the other is 38, and both are running on not much more than sentiments, levitating themselves above mundane questions of basic competence.
It's notable that Mr. Trump's approval rating has risen while the Democrats debated, campaigned and impeached. Maybe amid the fog of Washington's nonstop wars, voters are making choices about government competence, and concluding that Mr. Trump is by and large what he claimed to be -- a can-do businessman. Imagine voting for that.

In the course of one week, the 2020 presidential campaign has transformed into something new and unexpected: A general-election contest that will start late and unfold in a crisis atmosphere.
Normally, this would have been a week that marked a shift from primary season to general-election footing. Former Vice President Joe Biden swept the three Democratic primaries held on Tuesday, in Florida, Illinois and Arizona, all by double-digit margins. In doing so, he effectively ended the argument that his last competitor, Sen. Bernie Sanders, might catch him.
But a primary that wasn't held, in Ohio, told an equally big tale. Ohio canceled its primary out of fears citizens turning out to vote might spread the coronavirus. In so doing, Ohio didn't merely raise doubts about how and when remaining primaries will be conducted; it also demonstrated how heavily the coronavirus cloud hangs over the presidential contest.
Although it's now clear the vote this fall will pit Mr. Biden against President Trump, the country's coronavirus defensive crouch effectively banishes both from the campaign trail. In a sense, both are all dressed up for a general-election campaign, but with no place to go.
Like so many things in American life now, that situation is unprecedented, and neither campaign has a playbook for dealing with it. One thing is clear: Mr. Trump's handling of the crisis will become a central, if not the central, issue of the contest.
Mr. Biden already was trying to portray himself as a candidate with a combination of experience, competence and compassion, and now, with the crisis in mind, figures to double down on all those themes. Outside Democratic groups, meanwhile, geared up to attack Mr. Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
Yet, the week ended with some good news for Mr. Trump on the coronavirus front. Although he has been criticized for not responding more quickly, an ABC News/Ipsos poll found that during the past week the share of Americans who approve of his management of the crisis shot up to 55% from 43%.
The delayed start to the general-election campaign ""suits both sides, really,"" said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. For Mr. Trump, the delay means ""he can be president"" and campaign from within the confines of the White House. And it is ""a godsend"" for Mr. Biden, who needs time to raise money, which is in short supply.

WASHINGTON—Senators wavering on calling new witnesses in President Trump's impeachment trial hinted Wednesday at the factors they were considering, as Republican leaders tried to persuade lawmakers to bring the proceedings to a close later this week without fresh testimony.
After
several days of opening arguments
by each side that offered little give-and-take,
Wednesday's session
brought an opportunity for senators to direct questions at Mr. Trump's legal team and Democratic House members, who are serving as prosecutors in the trial. Mr. Trump's lawyers portrayed
Democrats' case for impeachment
as politically motivated and well short of the bar needed to remove a president from office. The Democratic lawmakers said they were trying to block Mr. Trump from cheating to win this year's election and argued that Republican senators were holding Mr. Trump to an unusually low standard.
Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
was pushing Republicans to defeat a vote
to bring in new witnesses and information, while Democrats argued that a fair trial would include additional evidence, including testimony from former national security adviser John Bolton. While Mr. McConnell (R., Ky.) had said a day earlier that he didn't yet have the votes to block more witnesses, Republican leaders suggested Wednesday they would eventually get there. Democratic leaders in the Senate said procuring additional testimony would be an uphill battle.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What questions are you hoping get asked and to whom? Why? Join the conversation below.
The Senate is expected to vote Friday on whether to call for witnesses.
In one notable exchange, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska—two Republican senators who have said they are debating siding with Democrats on calling new witnesses—asked a question that is central to the impeachment case: whether the White House had any record of Mr. Trump's trying to end corruption in Ukraine before former Vice President Joe Biden entered the Democratic presidential race last spring. The president has said an overall concern with Ukraine corruption was behind his call to announce an investigation of Mr. Biden while he was freezing nearly $400 million in aid to the country.
In response to the two senators' questions, which were read aloud by Chief Justice John Roberts, deputy White House counsel Pat Philbin said he had no such record of a previous concern with corruption by Mr. Trump. But he said the Republican president had developed concerns about Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter, after his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, had been pushing for Ukraine to investigate the former vice president in January 2019. Mr. Biden started his campaign in April. ""The president…gets information from Rudy Giuliani,"" Mr. Philbin said.
Mr. Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart in July to investigate the elder Mr. Biden's actions in Ukraine as vice president while his son served on the board of a gas company there.

Mr. Bolton in a forthcoming book
wrote that the president told him in August that he was holding up the aid until Ukraine agreed to the investigations he was seeking. The aid to Ukraine was released in September amid a bipartisan uproar in Congress.
Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the chamber's Democratic leader, asked the House lawmakers, who are essentially acting as prosecutors in the trial, if there could be a fair trial without calling Mr. Bolton.
""The short answer to that question is no,"" Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, responded. He told lawmakers not to wait for the book, which is due to be published in March.
In tweets Wednesday, Mr. Trump, who has denied making any connection between Ukraine aid and investigating the Bidens, urged Republicans to reject calling witnesses and called Mr. Bolton's yet unpublished book ""nasty & untrue."" The White House's National Security Council said Wednesday that it
told Mr. Bolton's lawyer last week
that Mr. Bolton's manuscript contained ""significant amounts"" of classified information and couldn't be published in its current form.
In response, Chuck Cooper, Mr. Bolton's lawyer, said he sought immediate guidance last week on whether the NSC deemed classified any of the material in the chapter related to Ukraine, though he said he didn't believe that information ""could reasonably be considered classified."" Mr. Cooper said he didn't get a response to his email.
Sens. Collins, Murkowski and Mitt Romney (R., Utah), another juror who has said he is open to new testimony, asked the president's lawyers how the Senate should view a situation in which Mr. Trump might have more than one reason to withhold aid from Ukraine.
""All elected officials, to some extent, have in mind how their conduct, how their decisions, their policy decisions, will affect the next election,"" Mr. Philbin replied. He said that ""can't be a basis for removing a president from office.""
In a departure from what the Trump team has previously argued, Alan Dershowitz offered a new theory: that because Mr. Trump believes his re-election is in the public interest, even if he had political motivations in pressing Ukraine to open an investigation into the Bidens, it wouldn't be impeachable.
""Every public official that I know believes that his election is in the public interest,"" Mr. Dershowitz said.
Mr. Schiff shot back that if President Obama, a Democrat, had asked Russia to investigate Mr. Romney, his 2012 opponent, the Senate would have found it impeachable. ""All quid pro quos are fine, it's carte blanche? Is that really what we're prepared to say?"" Mr. Schiff said.
The hypothetical continued when Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Ted Cruz of Texas asked Mr. Schiff: If Mr. Obama had evidence that Mr. Romney's son was being paid $1 million a year by a corrupt Russian company and Mr. Romney had acted to benefit that company, would Mr. Obama then have legal authority to ask for that to be investigated?
Mr. Schiff said that hypothetical didn't have a direct correlation and said the U.S. had ways to investigate corruption that didn't involve the president seeking a foreign leader's help.
The president's lawyers also argued that using credible information from foreign sources was appropriate. ""Mere information is not something that would violate the campaign-finance laws,"" Mr. Philbin said. ""The idea that any information that happens to come from overseas is necessarily campaign interference is a mistake.""
Democrats said they were stunned by that stance. Mr. Schiff characterized the defense team's stance as: ""It's now okay to criminally conspire with another country to get help in a presidential election."" Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D., Mich.) said people around her were dumbfounded, turning to their neighbors to confirm that they had heard Mr. Philbin correctly.
Mr. Trump and his allies have defended the push for investigations in Ukraine by arguing that it was corrupt for the elder Mr. Biden to seek the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had once investigated the Ukrainian gas company where his son sat on the board. Mr. Biden sought the prosecutor's removal as part of a broad international effort to combat corruption in Ukraine. The Bidens have denied wrongdoing.
Hunter Biden has said it was poor judgment to serve on the Burisma board, a position for which he was paid about $50,000 a month, while his father was involved with Ukraine policy.
The question-and-answer portion of the trial will continue on Thursday.
Republican leaders on Wednesday worked to dissuade Republicans from joining Democrats on seeking subpoenas for Mr. Bolton or others who may have close knowledge of the Ukraine pressure campaign. Mr. McConnell met Wednesday morning with Ms. Murkowski, who had earlier said that she was curious about what Mr. Bolton had to say. After the meeting, Ms. Murkowski declined to discuss witnesses or her meeting.
Mr. Romney and Ms. Collins repeated their interest in hearing from Mr. Bolton on Wednesday while other Republicans said that if the resolution passes, they would push to hear from the Bidens and the whistleblower whose account of the Ukraine effort spurred the impeachment inquiry.
Republicans sought to project confidence on Wednesday. ""I'm optimistic,"" Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the former Republican whip, said of defeating the motion to bring in new witnesses.
The House last fall had sought Mr. Bolton's testimony but declined to subpoena him because of Democrats' wish to move quickly and not get bogged down in court fights.

Meanwhile, more revelations emerged about Mr. Bolton's concerns about the administration's dealings with Ukraine. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.) said that in a Sept. 23 phone call, weeks after Mr. Trump fired Mr. Bolton, Mr. Bolton urged him, unprompted, to have his committee look into the removal of the former ambassador to Ukraine, suggesting something ""improper"" had occurred.
Marie Yovanovitch's removal last spring is one of several key episodes in the impeachment inquiry. The former ambassador was for months targeted by Mr. Giuliani, who said he wanted to remove her because she was obstructing his push for investigations in Ukraine. Mr. Trump, who has the unilateral authority to fire ambassadors, ordered her removed after hearing complaints from Mr. Giuliani.

The presidential election is 10 months away, but Michael Bloomberg's long-shot campaign is running like it's already late October.
The candidate has spent $217 million so far on television and digital advertising, mostly ignoring the Democratic primaries and squarely challenging President Trump. The total is roughly three-quarters of the amount spent by all other campaigns, including Mr. Trump's, combined.
It's the game plan the billionaire used in his campaign for mayor of New York City in 2001, when he outspent his competitor nearly 5 to 1. Big spending has also made his philanthropy a dominant force on climate change, gun control and other issues. And it is how he has managed his lucrative business, paying up to bring in talent.
The flow of cash -- dubbed the Bloomberg effect by media-measurement firm Advertising Analytics LLC -- has upended the financial dynamics of the election. Television ad rates jumped 45% in Houston after the Bloomberg campaign bought $1 million worth of ads in November, Advertising Analytics said. The campaign paid as much as double the going rate for staff and promised jobs to workers through November, whether or not Mr. Bloomberg stays in the race. The candidate, who is funding his run entirely by himself, now has 1,000 campaign staffers.
It's a big part of the reason roughly $20 billion is expected to be spent on political advertising this election cycle, dwarfing the previous record of $12 billion in 2016, according to media research firm, Borrell Associates.
""Everything about what Bloomberg is doing is unprecedented,"" said Rufus Gifford, former finance director for Barack Obama's presidential campaign. Mr. Bloomberg remains a long shot, Mr. Gifford said, ""but when you have Donald Trump as president and one of the 10 richest people running for president, anything can happen.""
Kevin Sheekey, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign manager, said there's more to Mr. Bloomberg's candidacy than his spending, pointing to wealthy but politically inexperienced candidates such as Meg Whitman or Ross Perot who failed in the past. ""Money won't just determine elections,"" he said. ""You have to have a record and a message.""
Lots of rich people have run for office, lots of candidates have claimed excellent business credentials and many have claimed to have top-flight data operations, which Mr. Bloomberg emphasizes. What sets his campaign apart is his $55 billion checkbook.
Mr. Bloomberg is No. 9 on the Forbes list of the world's richest people, ahead of each of the Google founders, either Koch brother and the wealthiest members of the Walton family. A person familiar with the plans said he could spend $500 million on the primaries alone, and Mr. Bloomberg hasn't ruled out spending $1 billion before November if needed.
""Certainly it's going to be disruptive,"" said Robert Wolf, former chairman and CEO of UBS Americas and a longtime Democratic donor. ""We just don't know how yet.""
Mr. Bloomberg, who was mayor of New York from 2002 to 2013, is currently supported by 6% of voters, compared with 27% for former Vice President Joe Biden in the Real Clear Politics average of polls. More voters have a negative than a positive view of Mr. Bloomberg, according to a Quinnipiac University National Poll from mid-December.
Mr. Bloomberg said he entered the race at a moment when polling data suggested voters placed less importance on ideology and more on finding a candidate who could beat Mr. Trump. His campaign believed Mr. Trump was winning the race and was going unchallenged in political ads in competitive states as Democratic candidates focused on the primary battle.
At the time, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was surging. Polls showed Mr. Biden beating Mr. Trump but within the margin of error. Ms. Warren's policies, such as a wealth tax, would likely hurt Mr. Bloomberg, and she is generally disliked by his circle of wealthy New Yorkers, according to a longtime staff member. Mr. Bloomberg has said he will back whoever wins the nomination, even if it is Ms. Warren or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
To offset criticism that he was running out of his own self interest, Mr. Bloomberg pledged $15 million to $20 million to register 500,000 voters before the election. His attacks on Mr. Trump are part of that effort.
""There's a sense that Bloomberg is doing something that the party can't do -- going negative on Trump,"" Mr. Gifford said. ""It's work that the party doesn't have the money to do, and other candidates don't have the ability to do.""
After Mr. Trump's campaign said it had bought a 60-second TV spot during the Super Bowl on Feb. 2, the Bloomberg campaign bought a 60-second spot that will target the president. The Bloomberg campaign declined to disclose how much it was spending for the spot, but advertising tracker Kantar/CMAG estimates it is worth $10 million.
Bloomberg spending has drawn Mr. Trump's attention. When the campaign aired an ad saying the president had broken his promise of protecting those with pre-existing health conditions, Mr. Trump pushed back on Twitter and labeled Mr. Bloomberg ""Mini Mike.""
Mr. Bloomberg's campaign said that because he started late, it is focusing on the Super Tuesday votes on March 3, rather than the early voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire. The plan plays to Mr. Bloomberg's financial advantage and minimizes his weaknesses -- shaking hands and making small talk with voters, and giving stump speeches. The Super Tuesday states, where 40% of delegates will be chosen, instead depend more on television and digital advertising.
In addition to huge TV spending -- $193 million on ads since his campaign began -- the campaign has spent heavily online. It spent $16.1 million on Google ads as of Jan. 11 and $6.8 million on Facebook as of the end of December according to Kantar/CMAG.
Mr. Trump has spent $6.5 million on digital ads, and Tom Steyer, the other billionaire Democratic candidate, has spent $5.6 million since Mr. Bloomberg entered the race in November, as of the end of last year.
The Bloomberg campaign is offering field organizers salaries of $6,000 a month. For state data directors, it's between $10,000 and $12,000 a month, according to job postings.
The campaign's 1,000-person payroll is more typical of an operation in the final months before Election Day. Mr. Biden has roughly 400 campaign staffers, while Mr. Sanders has built an 800-person staff.
The former mayor's late entry into the race has forced the campaign to ""create a sense of momentum and hope people will actually jump on,"" said a person familiar with Mr. Bloomberg's state operations.
Campaign veterans said money won't necessarily bring in the best staff and said many experienced staffers want to work for people they support. Other campaigns, including Ms. Warren's and Mr. Sanders's, already have operations in Super Tuesday states and are ramping up hiring in later states.
Mr. Bloomberg has spent in markets that haven't been targeted by other Democrats. His campaign has plunked down $21.2 million on television advertising in Texas, where none of the leading Democrats have spent a penny. It has spent $8.4 million in Pennsylvania, which doesn't hold its primary until April 28.
It has even poured resources into smaller states that are typically not on the primary radar. In Idaho, it has spent $979,000 so far; in Utah, $1.6 million.
""He is going far, far ahead of where the rest of the guys are scrumming,"" said Kip Cassino, executive vice president at Borrell Associates, the media research firm. ""He is basically saying, 'I'm not going to win in Iowa, and I am not going to get out there and kiss pigs. And I won't win in New Hampshire, but I will win in the rest of the states, and I will get the states that most everyone didn't care about before.'""
At the beginning of January, candidates had spent close to $540 million on political ads in the presidential race over the prior 12 months, about 10 times what would have been expected at this point in this election cycle, Mr. Cassino said.
""We have never seen anything like this,"" Mr. Cassino said, referring to Mr. Bloomberg's spending. ""We are only just starting to see how distorting this might be.""
Mr. Bloomberg's potential handicaps among Democratic voters include his support for Republican candidates in the past, including former President George W. Bush. Other issues that could hurt are his support for charter schools in his education-reform efforts, and the stop-and-frisk policy he adopted as mayor, in which New York police had wide latitude to detain and search passersby for contraband. A federal judge eventually ruled the policy violated the constitutional rights of minorities. Mr. Bloomberg apologized for the stop-and-frisk policy before he kicked off his campaign.
Some Democrats fear Mr. Bloomberg could drag out the primary with his limitless budget, or use his money to try to influence the leading candidates, hoping to pull some of them to the political center, which he sees as the way to beat Mr. Trump.
Mr. Bloomberg's team said the data operation he is building will benefit Democrats overall, which he said are far behind the Republicans on the gathering and use of voter data. His data firm, Hawkfish LLC, launched in the spring. It has hired Facebook's former chief marketing officer and the former CEO of Foursquare, the location tracking firm.
Mr. Bloomberg has cited his research and spending on the 2018 midterm elections as evidence of his commitment to the party's success. Democratic candidates won 21 of the 24 races in which he was involved. In most races, the spending focused on digital advertising early in the election cycle and TV advertising closer to election day, when ad reservations were more expensive and Republican groups could not as easily counter their message.
In an Oklahoma House of Representatives race, which appeared to be a long-shot for the Democrats, Mr. Bloomberg unleashed a wave of last-minute ads that attacked the Republican candidate. Democrat Kendra Horn won by a few thousand votes.
""I supported 24 candidates who were good on guns and good on environment, and 21 of them won, and that flipped the House,"" he said at a recent campaign stop in Philadelphia. ""So if it wasn't for that, you wouldn't have [Speaker of the House Nancy] Pelosi and you wouldn't have impeachment.""

WASHINGTON—Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said Thursday that the nation needs to harness a comprehensive public-health and economic response to the coronavirus, offering a look at how he would address a crisis in the White House.
The former vice president, in a speech near his home in Wilmington, Del., said the nation must respond aggressively to combat the spread of the disease, with practices and staff he described as grounded in science.
He said President Trump's labeling of the outbreak as a ""foreign virus"" during a Wednesday night Oval Office address ""does not displace accountability for the misjudgments that have been taken thus far by the Trump administration.""
""Let me be crystal clear, the coronavirus does not have a political affiliation,"" Mr. Biden said. ""It will infect Republicans, independents and Democrats alike.""
The former vice president outlined a new plan to fight the virus, saying the U.S. should lead a coordinated, global response that prepares hospitals and public-health workers and responds to the economic fallout. ""President Trump is welcome to adopt all of it today,"" he said.
Mr. Trump's campaign said in response that the president had ""acted early and decisively"" to fight the virus, and he had put the U.S. ""on stronger footing than other nations.""
""His every move has been aimed at keeping Americans safe, while Joe Biden has sought to capitalize politically and stoke citizens' fears,"" Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's communications director, said.
The image of Mr. Biden standing before a backdrop of American flags in a conference room at the Hotel DuPont aimed to project steadiness and serve as a counterweight to Mr. Trump, who has been accused by Democrats of providing a halting response to the outbreak.
It came as the coronavirus has forced the presidential campaigns of Mr. Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Mr. Trump to curtail their public activities. Mr. Biden canceled events in Ohio, Florida and Illinois this week; the campaign is planning ""virtual"" events in Chicago and Miami in coming days.
Mr. Biden's campaign said in an internal memo Thursday that all staff at its Philadelphia headquarters and around the country would work from home beginning Saturday. The campaign will continue to hold smaller events such as round-tables and house parties, but all fundraisers ""will become virtual fundraisers indefinitely.""
Mr. Sanders also addressed the pandemic in a speech in Burlington, Vt., using it to highlight Medicare for All, one of his signature policies. He said even without a single-payer health-care system, the government needed to provide care at no cost.
Mr. Trump, meanwhile, canceled a trip to Colorado and Nevada, including an appearance at a Republican Jewish Coalition event in Las Vegas. That event has since been postponed.
The president has publicly and privately chafed at postponing rallies and had largely defended continuing them as the virus escalated. The campaign had recently been looking at holding a rally in Tampa, but hadn't announced any plans as some allies grew concerned that Mr. Trump should put the activity on pause.
Speaking to reporters Thursday, Mr. Trump said the campaign had been looking at ""four or five"" rallies, adding that the never-announced event in Tampa was ""all sold out.""
""I think we'll probably not do it, because people would say it's better to not do. You know, we need a little separation until such time as this goes away,"" Mr. Trump said. ""It's going to go away. It's going to go away.""
Mr. Biden's speech came at a pivot point for his campaign as it readies for a likely general election battle against the president. Mr. Biden on Thursday installed Jennifer O'Malley Dillon,
a top former Obama campaign aide, as his new campaign manager
, succeeding Greg Schultz, who will focus on planning for the general election.
Mr. Biden's remarks effectively were a response to the Oval Office address of Mr. Trump, who announced a 30-day ban on most travel from Europe to the U.S.
The former vice president said Americans should have access to free testing for the virus, especially the elderly living in nursing homes, and said the nation needed to swiftly develop a vaccine for coronavirus.
Mr. Biden said the country also needed a strong economic response, and urged Congress to press for emergency paid leave for workers affected by the outbreak, an expansion and broadening of unemployment benefits and temporary loans for small businesses dealing with revenue shortfalls.
Some of those steps, including paid leave, have been pushed by the president, who has said workers affected by the virus should be able to ""stay home without fear of financial hardship."" The president has also pressed for payroll-tax relief and said the Small Business Administration will soon offer low-interest loans to small businesses.
Mr. Biden's campaign announced Wednesday its own advisory committee on coronavirus, bringing together several former Obama officials to provide what he described as science-based, expert advice on ways the campaign can minimize health risks for the candidate, staff and supporters.
But more than simply advising the campaign, the list of people served as a preview of the type of administration Mr. Biden might assemble if elected.
The committee includes former Obama homeland security and counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco, Dr. David Kessler, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and Dr. Vivek Murthy, who served as the nation's surgeon general.
Mr. Biden ""was there during the economic crisis, he oversaw the bailout. He's been there,"" said Dr. Zeke Emanuel, an advisory committee member and a vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania. ""More importantly, no single person can address these issues.""

DES MOINES, Iowa—In Iowa just days before the state's kickoff caucuses, President Trump pumped up a megarally while Vice President Mike Pence ordered a deluxe burger.
Showcasing their commitment to a key early-voting and general-election state, the president and vice president both traveled to Iowa on Thursday and illustrated their contrasting campaign styles.
The president descended into the state on Air Force One that night. He addressed thousands of screaming supporters packed into an arena at Drake University, declaring, ""We are going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats.""
His vice president arrived earlier for a daylong bus tour that included the kind of traditional political pit stops that his boss rarely makes, chatting with voters at fast-food joints and diners. He stopped by a Culver's—a Midwestern staple known for its ButterBurgers and frozen custard, where he greeted a pastor and a pleasantly surprised mother with her little girl and ordered a Culver's deluxe with bacon. Later he posed for pictures at Des Moines's Drake Diner.
With
Mr. Trump's impeachment trial
under way, both the president and vice president sought to redirect attention to the 2020 race and energize the state's Republicans days before the Feb. 3 caucuses. While Mr. Trump was free to hit the campaign trail, four senators seeking to unseat him were stuck in Washington, serving as jurors weighing the charges against him.
The visits by Messrs. Trump and Pence reflect their campaign's effort to boost turnout and test its organizational muscle in an important general-election state. They also illustrated the different roles the duo will play on the campaign trail, with Mr. Trump sticking to his signature megarallies and Mr. Pence checking in on smaller interest groups.
Speaking in Des Moines, Mr. Trump touted his new trade deal with Canada and Mexico, as well as the ""phase one"" trade agreement with China, framing the deals as important to the state's agricultural community.
""I have a place in my heart for the farmers,"" he said.
The president also cited the recent U.S. strike on an Iranian military leader, saying ""we ended his bloody rampage forever."" He said congressional Democrats are ""obsessed with a deranged witch hunt hoax,"" again referring to the impeachment proceedings as ""impeachment light."" And he criticized several Democratic presidential hopefuls, including Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden.
""Joe had a crowd that was so small the other day that they set up a round table,"" Mr. Trump said.
Mr. Pence crisscrossed Iowa on Thursday in a blue bus stamped with the campaign logo and a picture of the vice president flashing a wide grin beside Mr. Trump. During a speech before evangelical Christian voters in Sioux City, the vice president sought to keep the focus on his boss, declaring: ""I just spoke to him on the bus, told him I was in Sioux City, Iowa, and I think he sounded just a little bit jealous.""
Connie Schmett, co-chair of the Republican Party of Polk County, Iowa, said Messrs. Trump and Pence were a good pair because of their different styles.
""With President Trump, we have so many people that are so excited about this man because he is not the normal politician,"" she said. ""Vice President Pence is a little more mainstream. He's soft-spoken. He's a kind man. I think they complement each other.""
During his previous campaign, Mr. Trump largely eschewed the intimate campaigning that Iowa caucus voters expect. He placed second in the Republican contest to Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who invested in traditional Iowa politicking, but won the state in the 2016 general election, exceeding Democrat Hillary Clinton's margin by nearly 10 percentage points.
Throughout his campaign stops, Mr. Pence hammered talking points that Trump aides believe will resonate with Iowa Republicans: He dismissed the Democratic candidates as radical socialists, emphasized the administration's efforts to restrict abortion access and to protect gun rights and highlighted the condition of the U.S. economy.
Mr. Pence also criticized impeachment proceedings seeking to remove Mr. Trump from office, on
charges of abuse of power
and
obstruction of Congress
, as a ""shameful attempt to overthrow the will of the American people.""

What approach to campaigning do you prefer to see from presidential candidates? Why? Join the conversation below.
But Mr. Pence's approach leaves him more likely to come face to face with his critics, something that Mr. Trump rarely experiences at his rallies packed with adoring supporters.
On Thursday, during his stop at Drake Diner, Mr. Pence was confronted by a man who criticized the administration's recent plan to allow states to convert federal Medicaid funding to block grants. The change would let them impose changes such as eligibility requirements and prescription drug limits for millions of adults.
""There are people I see at the emergency department that can't get primary care doctors. Once they got Medicaid they can get primary care doctors. They stay out of the ER. They actually work more. They actually contribute to our community more,"" said Rob Davidson, who identified himself as the executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare. ""Now, if you cut those people—sorry, you don't get your health care? That's going to be a real negative in their lives.""
Mr. Pence said he respectfully disagreed.
The president and vice president are campaigning for re-election in a way that seeks to leverage both traditional stumping and the appeal of Mr. Trump's rallies. Mr. Pence was meeting with evangelical voters and veterans Thursday, both important coalitions for their campaign.
White House officials said Mr. Pence's events are meant to counterbalance the president's rallies with a more targeted approach—a formula the vice president has repeated in other states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Florida.
""It's a chance for him to gauge the reaction in a community,"" said Marc Short, the vice president's chief of staff, of Mr. Pence's frequent stops at diners and local restaurants. The White House works with the president's re-election campaign to help determine which parts of key states to visit, aides said.
Mr. Pence's appearance in Iowa four days before the caucuses is sure to revive questions about his own political ambitions. The vice president is widely believed to be interested in running for president himself someday. But Mr. Pence's aides bristled at the suggestion that his visit had the secondary benefit of building groundwork for an eventual campaign of his own.
Mr. Trump's victory in Iowa in 2016 came after Barack Obama won the state in 2008 and 2012. Recent polls of Iowa show Mr. Trump in a close contest in hypothetical matchups against the leading Democratic candidates.
With no serious Republican challenger, the president is expected to win his party's caucuses easily, though GOP attendance is likely to be very light. Still, more than 80 campaign surrogates are scheduled to flood the state for the Feb. 3 voting, including cabinet officials, members of Congress and top campaign aides.

So it appears the firewall is holding for former Vice President Joe Biden this week. If that remains the case, a key question is: How much will that matter next week?
A tense campaign week draws to a close with the South Carolina primary election Saturday. It has become almost a cliché at this point to say that South Carolina is a must-win state for Mr. Biden—and that a Biden win there is the best bet for the rest of the field to blunt the momentum of a
rising Sen. Bernie Sanders
.
Yet the cliché is holding true, and the news from South Carolina has been mostly good for Mr. Biden. He leads in every one of six South Carolina statewide polls released in the last week—including a whopping lead of 20 percentage points in a Monmouth University survey.
A South Carolina win, particularly a comfortable one, would inject a dose of new life into what had been a flagging Biden campaign. Yet it is unclear how much help that would provide him heading into next week's Super Tuesday voting in 14 states spread across the country.
There isn't enough time to translate
a South Carolina win

SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do you think Joe Biden's chances of winning the Democratic election are improving or declining, and why? Join the conversation below.
into a big fundraising surge, which is one of the things the Biden campaign needs, and not many days to build momentum. An important consideration in coming days, then, is where Mr. Biden will be in the best position to take advantage in Super Tuesday states, many of which show Mr. Sanders leading in the polls.
Alabama, Arkansas, Virginia, North Carolina and Tennessee all vote next Tuesday, and all have relatively large populations of African-American voters, who are Mr. Biden's most loyal and important group. Oklahoma is a conservative state where the limited public polling shows Mr. Biden slightly ahead of the liberal Mr. Sanders.
Three Super Tuesday states are the home states to Biden competitors: Vermont is the home state of Mr. Sanders, Massachusetts of Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Minnesota of Sen. Amy Klobuchar. That reduces Mr. Biden's chances in all those places, but also means lagging behind those rivals there won't be seen as an unpleasant surprise.
Still, Mr. Biden's biggest problem in taking advantage of any good South Carolina news is New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He appears on ballots for the first time on Super Tuesday, has spent millions of dollars advertising in those states, and stands smack in the middle of
Mr. Biden's moderate lane

WASHINGTON—An emboldened President Trump turned his focus Sunday to his re-election bid, arguing a growing economy would help him in November, as Democrats' lead impeachment manager vowed to press for the president's removal even as the Senate is virtually certain to acquit him.
""It was all nonsense,"" Mr. Trump said of impeachment during a Fox News interview. ""It's a very serious thing. It should never happen to another president.""
In a separate television appearance, Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) said that in closing arguments in the impeachment trial Monday, Democrats would continue pressing to remove Mr. Trump from office over his Ukraine pressure campaign.
""It's enormously important that the country understand exactly what this president did,"" said Mr. Schiff. He said the Senate should remove Mr. Trump from office ""because he is threatening to still cheat in the next election by soliciting foreign interference.""
The televised comments by Messrs. Trump and Schiff came just ahead of the Iowa caucuses Monday, the State of the Union address Tuesday and the expected acquittal of Mr. Trump by Senate Republicans on Wednesday. They also came as
new polling showed Americans' views of him
were little-changed by his impeachment.
In Iowa, site of the nation's first Democratic nominating contest, contenders were crisscrossing the state trying to appeal to the many voters who have said they would make their choice based on who they think has the best chance to unseat Mr. Trump in November.
""I just want Trump out,"" said Sandy Suplee, a 58-year-old laborer from Pella, Iowa. She said she would set aside her personal preferences among the candidates to support former Vice President Joe Biden, whom she believes has the best odds of winning.
For Trump supporter Susan Ohnysty, a 60-year-old in West Des Moines, impeachment was a ""waste of time,"" adding that the articles of impeachment ""were not meeting the standards of a high crime.""
Friday,
the Senate voted 51-49
to reject Democrats demands to call new witnesses in the impeachment trial. That
effectively ended the impeachment effort,
even though the trial will resume for four hours of closing arguments Monday, followed by a vote on the articles of impeachment Wednesday.
A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found a majority of voters said they believed Mr. Trump abused his power by asking Ukraine to investigate a potential political opponent in order to influence the coming election, and also that Mr. Trump obstructed Congress by not cooperating with the impeachment inquiry.
But there wasn't majority support for removing him from office. Among those surveyed, 49% said he should be allowed to finish his term, compared to 46% who said he should be removed.
Mr. Trump's job approval in the January poll stood at 46%, with 51% disapproving, in line with results throughout the Trump presidency.
Mr. Schiff, when pressed on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" on what Democrats would do after Mr. Trump's likely acquittal, said he wasn't looking beyond the trial.
""I'm not letting the senators off the hook,"" Mr. Schiff said. ""We're still going to go into the Senate this week and make the case why this president needs to be removed.""
Asked if Democrats would consider subpoenaing former national security adviser John Bolton—
whose coming book alleges
that the president told him he wanted to hold up aid to Ukraine until he got the investigations he wanted—Mr. Schiff declined to answer definitively but said there are several possible options.
In a separate television appearance on Sunday, one of the president's attorneys in the Senate trial, Alan Dershowitz, argued that there is no need to seek out new information.
""The articles of impeachment did not charge an impeachable offense,"" Mr. Dershowitz said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""So the right answer is to dismiss it and cut it off right there. No amount of witnesses could have changed that conclusion.""
Mr. Dershowitz also reframed one of his arguments last week, about whether Mr. Trump could have believed his re-election was in the national interest.
""If the president did something completely lawful, the fact that part of his motivation may have been to help his election cannot be the quid pro quo,"" he said. ""I don't believe that a president can do anything that he thinks is the national interest.""
The Senate impeachment trial commanded 11 days of attention and appeared to be heading for a final vote Saturday. But a decision to break until a resumption this week was bipartisan, said Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.).
That gave Democratic senators campaigning for president a chance to hit the trail in Iowa, while others got a chance to relax. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham headed home to South Carolina, where a pulled pork platter awaited him.
""We all need a break,"" said Mr. Graham. ""This is as close to purgatory as any of us want to get.""
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democratic presidential hopeful, missed a scheduled campaign appearance at a Friday evening town hall in Des Moines, leaving her campaign co-chairs to hold down the fort. However, the Senate trial adjourned in enough time for Ms. Warren to show up at a hastily arranged late-night campaign event at a brewery across the street from the town-hall venue.
Some in the White House saw an upside to the timing, with Mr. Trump giving his State of the Union address before his likely acquittal. Eric Ueland, the White House legislative liaison, told reporters it would bring focus to what he said were Mr. Trump's accomplishments while contrasting with the various investigations into the president.
""It's a strong one-two punch,"" he said.

HOUSTON—Bernie Sanders's resounding victory in
the weekend's Nevada caucuses
cast him as the clear front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination and enhanced the Vermont senator's argument that he can build a diverse coalition of voters ahead of potentially decisive contests.
At the same time, the senator's latest win, and his momentum ahead of next Saturday's South Carolina primary and the
Super Tuesday contests March 3
, are stirring increasing anxiety among some establishment Democrats who believe a more centrist nominee would have a better chance to beat President Trump in November and help carry down-ballot candidates across the finish line. If Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, performs well on March 3, when more than one-third of the total convention delegates are up for grabs, it could be difficult for any Democratic rivals to overtake him.
Mr. Sanders has said he can expand the electorate by bringing in new voters, which would help him overcome any concerns about ideology in a general election. Nevada, a more diverse state than mostly white Iowa and New Hampshire, gave Mr. Sanders the first opportunity to show he can expand the electorate and build the ""multigeneration, multiracial coalition"" he has said will propel him. This year's Nevada caucuses are on track to break turnout records.
""We have won the popular vote in Iowa, we won the New Hampshire primary, we won the Nevada caucus,"" Mr. Sanders told supporters in Houston on Sunday, at a rally ahead of the March 3 Texas primary. ""Don't tell anybody this, these folks get very, very agitated and nervous, we're gonna win here in Texas, and in November, we're going to defeat Trump here in Texas.""
Mr. Sanders's strong position shows the appeal of running as anti-establishment on both sides of the aisle; Mr. Trump, after all, ran as a GOP outsider in 2016. The Vermont senator's position would have been unimaginable five years ago, when the independent, who has never changed his party affiliation to Democrat in the Senate, launched his first-long shot bid for the presidency.
But with his policy positions long seen as far to the left of many Democrats, many party veterans are haunted by the memory of liberal Sen. George McGovern's 49-state loss to GOP President Richard Nixon in 1972. A nomination of Mr. Sanders would mark a decisive break with the more center-left path forged by Bill Clinton in 1992 and Barack Obama in 2008.

Mr. Sanders leads Mr. Trump
in a poll of a general-election matchup, although his margin is thinner than those of some other top contenders.
With 60% of Nevada precincts having reported by Sunday afternoon, former Vice President Joe Biden—a more moderate candidate who was the national polling leader for most of 2019—was in second place, followed by Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Sen. Amy Klobuchar appeared to be on track for fifth place, while businessman and activist Tom Steyer looked set to place sixth.
Mr. Biden attended church services Sunday in a predominantly black neighborhood of North Charleston, S.C. In an acknowledgment of Mr. Sanders's strength in the three prior contests, Mr. Biden told reporters: ""Whoever wins this primary is going into Super Tuesday very strongly, and I think it's going to be Bernie and me going into Super Tuesday.""

According to entrance polls in Nevada
, Mr. Sanders won nearly every demographic segment—including voters ages 17 to 64, white voters, Latino voters and first time caucus-goers. The only segments he lost to Mr. Biden were black voters, voters over age 65 and voters opposed to a single-payer health-care system. Mr. Sanders supports a program known as Medicare for All.
Mr. Sanders's coalition will be put to the test in the next round of states. In his unsuccessful 2016 primary bid against Hillary Clinton, he struggled to bring in support from minorities. While he trails Mr. Biden in South Carolina, a
Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Friday
showed Messrs. Sanders and Biden running even among black Democratic primary voters nationally, a crucial part of Mr. Biden's constituency in South Carolina and other Southern states.
Mr. Biden mingled with church-goers who generally represent his base of support in the primary. Ken Morris, a 68-year-old retired member of the Marine Corps, said he believed Mr. Sanders couldn't win the general election.
""There's not too many people who believe in socialism,"" Mr. Morris said. ""Joe is more centrist. More people trust him. You can't beat a guy who is all the way to the right by going all the way to the left.""
Voters, particularly those who are younger, say Mr. Sanders's ""consistency"" on the issues of health care, climate change and education is why they back him over the rest of the crowded field. Some older voters who were originally skeptical of Mr. Sanders say they see he has the momentum—backed by a swell of enthusiastic young supporters—to win this cycle.
Steve McCormack, a 49-year-old business owner from the Houston suburb of The Woodlands, attended Mr. Sanders's Houston rally on Sunday. Mr. McCormack voted for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio in the 2016 GOP primary and sat out the general election. But this cycle, he said is going to vote ""blue no matter who,"" and he believes Mr. Sanders may be the nominee.
""I see it might be going this way"" toward Mr. Sanders winning the primary, he said.
Mr. Sanders is benefiting from a fractured field in which voters are splintered among his more moderate opponents. Mr. Trump enjoyed a similar situation on his way to claiming the Republican nomination in 2016, when much of the GOP establishment argued Mr. Trump would turn off too many voters to win the general election.
Super Tuesday states have had less consistent polling than some of the earlier ones, but Mr. Sanders has led recent polls in delegate-rich California and Texas. He has projected confidence about both states and has said a win in California means he would likely be on his way to the nomination.
But some Democrats and groups looking to boost centrists aren't ready to concede the nomination.
""The race is not over, said Jonathan Kott, executive director of the Big Tent Project, which is running ads opposing Mr. Sanders in South Carolina. ""You have a lot of people still in the race, you have a lot of people that could win in different states.""
When asked if nominating Mr. Sanders could put Democrats' House majority in danger, Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, a top member of House Democratic leadership, said on ABC's ""This Week"" that ""a lot of people think so.""
The president's campaign has already signaled it would
tag Democrats as socialists in the general election
, particularly in states like Florida in an attempt to sway Venezuelan- and Cuban-Americans. Mr. Sanders has said his version of democratic socialism is a belief in basic rights for everyone, adding that his policies would be similar to those of former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
After South Carolina, the Democratic field will face former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the approximately $160 million he has spent on television and radio ads across Super Tuesday states, according to data from political-ad tracker Kantar/CMAG. That sum dwarfs that of the next biggest spender, Mr. Steyer. Because Mr. Bloomberg didn't compete in the first four states, Super Tuesday will be the first time candidates face the barrage of ads which could complicate the path for any candidate still in the race.

Hackers believed to be affiliated with Russia's military breached the Ukrainian gas company where former Vice President Joe Biden's son had served on the board as it became a focus of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, according to a U.S. cybersecurity firm.
Attempts to hack into Burisma Holdings began last November as Congress was holding hearings on whether Mr. Trump abused his office by
pressuring his Ukrainian counterpart
to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate Mr. Biden and his son Hunter, according to
research published
Monday by Area 1, a California-based company.
The hacking attempts are ongoing and linked to the Russian military intelligence unit previously known as the GRU, which hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the 2016 presidential election, Area 1 said.
The Russian Embassy in Washington didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Russia has denied hacking into U.S. elections.
It wasn't known what information the hackers were seeking or what they obtained, the firm said. In at least one instance, the hackers tricked the recipient of a phishing email into sharing login credentials that allowed them access into one of Burisma's servers, the company said. Area 1's findings were earlier reported by the New York Times.
Messrs. Trump and Giuliani have argued, without evidence, that Mr. Biden's anticorruption push in Ukraine was designed to head off any investigation of Burisma. Both Bidens
have denied wrongdoin
g and said they never discussed Hunter's business in Ukraine.

How do you think the purported Burisma hack will affect the Trump impeachment trial? Join the conversation below.
Senior U.S. intelligence officials have repeatedly warned that Russia and other hostile foreign powers
remain intent on interfering
in the coming presidential election. U.S. intelligence agencies have provided classified briefings to the Senate showing that the
Kremlin has labored
to seed the narrative, espoused by Mr. Trump and some of his allies, that it was Ukraine and not Russia that hacked the 2016 election, according to people familiar with the matter.
The hacking technique used to target Burisma, though common, bears strong resemblance to how the
Kremlin infiltrated the email inbox
of the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign chairman. The scheme involved creating fake websites that posed as sign-in pages for Burisma subsidiaries and directing Burisma employees via emails to the malicious websites, where they would be asked to enter their credentials.
In a statement, Mr. Biden's campaign said the purported hack of Burisma demonstrated his strength as a challenger to Mr. Trump and called on the president to denounce any attempt by foreign powers to interfere in U.S. politics.
""Donald Trump tried to coerce Ukraine into lying about Joe Biden and a major bipartisan, international anticorruption victory because he recognized that he can't beat the vice president,"" said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the campaign. ""Now we know that Vladimir Putin also sees Joe Biden as a threat. Any American president who had not repeatedly encouraged foreign interventions of this kind would immediately condemn this attack on the sovereignty of our elections.""
The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Oren Falkowitz, co-founder of Area 1 and a former National Security Agency official, said the company was ""100%"" confident that Russia's military intelligence was responsible for the breach. Mr. Falkowitz said that the company had made a series of disclosures about its findings to U.S. intelligence agencies before its publication of the research Monday. Area 1 wasn't hired to conduct the research.
Mr. Falkowitz said the company discovered evidence of a Russian phishing campaign on New Year's Eve and determined in the following days that each of the targets were subsidiaries of Burisma.

WASHINGTON—President Trump's re-election campaign said Thursday that its war chest stood at more than $100 million headed into the 2020 election year, after raising $46 million in the final three months of 2019.
Mr. Trump faces no significant Republican challenger, putting him at a campaign finance advantage over the many Democrats vying for their party's nomination in a highly competitive and costly primary. Although Mr. Trump is expected to have raised more than any single Democrat last quarter, together those candidates will at least double his haul but are expected to have much less cash on hand.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Where do you expect President Trump's campaign to focus its resources? Where would you like to see them allocated? Join the conversation below.
Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said that this was the president's biggest fundraising quarter during the 2020 campaign cycle, calling him ""an unstoppable juggernaut."" Over the full year, the president's campaign raised a total of $143 million and had $102.7 million in the bank at the end of 2019.
Presidential campaigns must report fourth-quarter fundraising information to the Federal Election Commission by Jan. 31. Mr. Trump's fundraising tops the numbers that have been announced by Democratic presidential hopefuls.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, of Vermont,
brought in $34.5 million
in the final quarter of the year, according to his campaign, and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said he
raised $24.7 million
. Former Vice President Joe Biden said his campaign raised $22.7 million. None of the candidates released updated cash on hand numbers. Some candidates haven't released any numbers yet.
The president also works closely with the Republican National Committee to raise money, and the figures reported by the Trump campaign don't include the RNC's latest finances.
Mr. Trump gave himself an advantage by kicking off his re-election the day he was inaugurated. While recent presidents typically have waited until their third year in office to return to the campaign trail, Mr. Trump
immediately arranged to fundraise
for re-election and never stopped holding the large political rallies that helped him win office in 2016.
Sitting presidents almost always enjoy strong fundraising for re-election. Former President Barack Obama raised about $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, and former President George W. Bush raised $47.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Mr. Bush's campaign had almost $100 million in available cash at the start of his re-election year, the FEC reports show.
An advantage of incumbency is that Mr. Trump has been able to solicit maximum $360,600 donations from individuals, circumventing the far lower $2,800-per-donor cap now in place for the Democratic hopefuls. Those large checks are spread among Mr. Trump's fundraising partners, the RNC and state-level Republican parties. The eventual Democratic nominee also will be able to create a bigger-ticket fundraising program, but Mr. Trump has been benefiting from his arrangement for almost three years already.

WASHINGTON -- The coronavirus crisis is rapidly changing President Trump's re-election strategy, forcing him into the position of leading the nation through a sprawling, complex emergency while undermining his greatest asset: a strong economy.
Mr. Trump this week has taken steps to demonstrate more command, appearing at daily news conferences and taking a solemn outlook, while his campaign weighs how to contend with battered financial markets and rising unemployment.
""People are going to judge him in this moment -- and this moment is going to last for a while,"" said Mike DuHaime, a Republican strategist not involved in the campaign. ""In the beginning he downplayed it too much and that hurt his credibility, but there is a lot of time to go now where he can compensate.""
That is forefront in the thinking of Mr. Trump's campaign advisers. The virus might ease amid extraordinary steps affecting all aspects of everyday life, and the campaign could resume its normal rhythms before Election Day. But the situation might also get worse.
Mr. Trump's campaign is banking on the economy bouncing back ahead of the crucial several months before November when voters are paying the most attention, advisers say. It has begun to formulate an argument that Mr. Trump's policies since taking office fueled the economy to new heights, and that he is best equipped to build it up a second time if necessary.
""We will point out that it is under the present policies that it was so vibrant and those policies are still in place,"" campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said. ""The stock market will rebound, and the economy will still be in solid shape.""
This week the main super PAC supporting Mr. Trump's re-election held discussions on possible ads highlighting steps the president has taken to combat the virus, including putting travel restrictions on China, according to a person familiar with the talks.
In recent days Mr. Trump has referred to the ""Chinese virus,"" a term that has been criticized for its racist connotations. His campaign on Wednesday moved to portray him as taking tough actions against a world rival and sought to draw a contrast with Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who is closing in on the party's presidential nomination.
The former vice president's campaign observed that the president has praised Chinese President Xi Jinping for his handling of the emergency. Of a Trump-campaign email that accused Mr. Biden of ""incompetence and misinformation,"" Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo said, ""This is projection, pure and simple -- a classic Trump campaign move.""
For now, campaign mechanics -- including the rallies that energize Mr. Trump as much as his supporters -- are in the background or on hold and the burden largely rests on the president using the White House stage to make his case. His discipline at news conferences this week has pleased advisers, though they privately acknowledge anything can change.
""I think the base will hold with him no matter, but if he does dumb stuff, he won't be able to build on his reach to voters,"" one adviser said.
Only a short time ago Mr. Trump was feeling especially confident. He emerged from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and then withstood impeachment. His campaign was running smoothly.
Now those gains are in jeopardy. A Gallup poll released Tuesday showed Mr. Trump's approval rating was down to 44%, slipping 5 percentage points and back to pre-impeachment levels. Among independent voters, his approval was down 7 percentage points.
Campaign officials and advisers said the tactics are evolving. While the campaign is unlikely to run any new ads focused on the economy, some believe those spots could be airing again by the fall. Mr. Trump and his team have careened from one political crisis to the next since the 2016 election, and there has been little change in his approval rating since he took office.
""Look, if in 45 days it looks like everything is going back to normal,"" one adviser said, ""then everything is going to go back to where it was.""

Some Senate Republicans see the presentations from President Trump's lawyers in the Senate impeachment trial as hurting Joe Biden's prospects in the 2020 election.
At the center of the House Democratic impeachment effort has been Mr. Trump's request that Ukraine open investigations into the former vice president. While the White House has said that Mr. Trump was concerned about possible corruption when he made the request, Democrats have argued that Mr. Trump only wanted to tar Mr. Biden to help the president win the 2020 election.
Mr. Biden is currently a front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary.
As part of their presentation in the trial Monday, members of the president's legal team repeatedly raised questions about the service of Mr. Biden's son, Hunter Biden, on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father as vice president was overseeing U.S. efforts to combat corruption in Ukraine. Mr. Trump and his allies have called the arrangement corrupt. No evidence has emerged of wrongdoing by either Biden.
Some Republicans emerged from the defense team's presentation on Monday and said the discussion of the Bidens could prove politically damaging.
""I really think it opened the eyes of not just the folks in the Senate, but many for those folks at home that were watching this afternoon. And with the Iowa caucuses coming up Feb. 3, this next Monday night, maybe it will influence some of those voters as well,"" said Sen. Joni Ernst (R., Iowa).
Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) said that House Democratic efforts to discredit the attacks on the Bidens opened the door to Mr. Trump's lawyers discussing the allegations in depth. Democrats said they were addressing the substance of Mr. Trump's request to Ukraine.
""They, as a practical matter, I think threw Joe Biden under the bus,"" Mr. Cruz said.

WASHINGTON -- An emboldened President Trump turned his focus Sunday to his re-election bid, arguing a growing economy would help him in November, as Democrats' lead impeachment manager vowed to press for the president's removal even as the Senate is virtually certain to acquit him.
""It was all nonsense,"" Mr. Trump said of impeachment during a Fox News interview. ""It's a very serious thing. It should never happen to another president.""
In a separate television appearance, Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) said that in closing arguments in the impeachment trial Monday, Democrats would continue pressing to remove Mr. Trump from office over his Ukraine pressure campaign.
""It's enormously important that the country understand exactly what this president did,"" Mr. Schiff said. The Senate should remove Mr. Trump from office, Mr. Schiff said, ""because he is threatening to still cheat in the next election by soliciting foreign interference.""
The televised comments by Messrs. Trump and Schiff came just ahead of the Iowa caucuses Monday, the State of the Union address Tuesday and the expected acquittal of Mr. Trump by Senate Republicans on Wednesday. They also came as new polling showed voters' views of him were little-changed by his impeachment.
In Iowa, site of the nation's first presidential nominating contest, Democratic contenders were crisscrossing the state trying to appeal to the many voters who have said they would make their choice based on who they think has the best chance to unseat the Republican president in November.
""I just want Trump out,"" said Sandy Suplee, a 58-year-old laborer from Pella, Iowa. She said she would set aside her personal preferences among the candidates to support former Vice President Joe Biden, whom she believes has the best odds of winning.
For Trump supporter Susan Ohnysty, a 60-year-old in West Des Moines, impeachment was a ""waste of time,"" adding that the articles of impeachment ""were not meeting the standards of a high crime.""
On Friday, the Senate voted 51-49 to reject Democrats' demands to call new witnesses in the impeachment trial. That effectively ended the impeachment effort, even though the trial is set to resume for four hours of closing arguments Monday, followed by a vote on the articles of impeachment Wednesday.
A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found a majority of voters said they believed Mr. Trump abused his power by asking Ukraine to investigate a potential political opponent in order to influence the coming election, and also that Mr. Trump obstructed Congress by not cooperating with the impeachment inquiry.
But there wasn't majority support for removing him from office. The poll found 49% said he should be allowed to finish his term, compared with 46% who said he should be removed.
Mr. Trump's job approval in the January poll stood at 46%, with 51% disapproving, in line with results throughout the Trump presidency.
Mr. Schiff, when pressed in an interview on CBS on what Democrats would do after Mr. Trump's likely acquittal, said he wasn't looking beyond the trial.
""I'm not letting the senators off the hook,"" Mr. Schiff said. ""We're still going to go into the Senate this week and make the case why this president needs to be removed.""
Asked if Democrats would consider subpoenaing former national security adviser John Bolton -- whose coming book alleges that the president told him he wanted to hold up aid to Ukraine until he got the investigations he wanted -- Mr. Schiff declined to answer definitively but said there are several possible options.
In a separate television appearance on Sunday, one of the president's attorneys in the Senate trial, Alan Dershowitz, argued that there is no need to seek out new information.
""The articles of impeachment did not charge an impeachable offense,"" Mr. Dershowitz said on Fox News. ""So the right answer is to dismiss it and cut it off right there. No amount of witnesses could have changed that conclusion.""
Mr. Dershowitz also reframed one of his arguments last week, about whether Mr. Trump could have believed his re-election was in the national interest. ""If the president did something completely lawful, the fact that part of his motivation may have been to help his election cannot be the quid pro quo,"" he said. ""I don't believe that a president can do anything if he thinks it is in the national interest.""
The Senate impeachment trial commanded 11 days of attention and appeared to be heading for a final vote Saturday. But a decision to break until a resumption this week was bipartisan, Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.) said. That gave Democratic senators campaigning for president a chance to hit the trail in Iowa, while others got a chance to relax.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) headed home, where a pulled pork platter awaited him. ""We all need a break,"" Mr. Graham said. ""This is as close to purgatory as any of us want to get.""
Some in the White House saw an upside to the timing, with Mr. Trump giving his State of the Union address before his likely acquittal. Eric Ueland, the White House legislative liaison, told reporters it would bring focus to what he said were Mr. Trump's accomplishments while contrasting with the various investigations into the president.

HOUSTON—Bernie Sanders's resounding victory in
the weekend's Nevada caucuses
cast him as the clear front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination and enhanced the Vermont senator's argument that he can build a diverse coalition of voters ahead of potentially decisive contests.
At the same time, the senator's latest win, and his momentum ahead of next Saturday's South Carolina primary and the
Super Tuesday contests March 3
, are stirring increasing anxiety among some establishment Democrats who believe a more centrist nominee would have a better chance to beat President Trump in November and help carry down-ballot candidates across the finish line. If Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, performs well on March 3, when more than one-third of the total convention delegates are up for grabs, it could be difficult for any Democratic rivals to overtake him.
Mr. Sanders has said he can expand the electorate by bringing in new voters, which would help him overcome any concerns about ideology in a general election. Nevada, a more diverse state than mostly white Iowa and New Hampshire, gave Mr. Sanders the first opportunity to show he can expand the electorate and build the ""multigeneration, multiracial coalition"" he has said will propel him. This year's Nevada caucuses are on track to break turnout records.
""We have won the popular vote in Iowa, we won the New Hampshire primary, we won the Nevada caucus,"" Mr. Sanders told supporters in Houston on Sunday, at a rally ahead of the March 3 Texas primary. ""Don't tell anybody this, these folks get very, very agitated and nervous, we're gonna win here in Texas, and in November, we're going to defeat Trump here in Texas.""
Mr. Sanders's strong position shows the appeal of running as antiestablishment on both sides of the aisle; Mr. Trump, after all, ran as a GOP outsider in 2016. The Vermont senator's position would have been unimaginable five years ago, when the independent, who has never changed his party affiliation to Democrat in the Senate, launched his first long-shot bid for the presidency.
But with his policy positions long seen as far to the left of many Democrats, many party veterans are haunted by the memory of liberal Sen. George McGovern's 49-state loss to GOP President Richard Nixon in 1972. A nomination of Mr. Sanders would mark a decisive break with the more center-left path forged by Bill Clinton in 1992 and Barack Obama in 2008.

Mr. Sanders leads Mr. Trump
in a poll of a general-election matchup, although his margin is thinner than those of some other top contenders.
With about 88% of Nevada precincts reporting Sunday evening, former Vice President Joe Biden—a more moderate candidate who was the national polling leader for most of 2019—was in second place, followed by Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Billionaire activist Tom Steyer looked set to place fifth while Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar followed closely behind in sixth.
Mr. Biden attended church services on Sunday in a predominantly black neighborhood of North Charleston, S.C. In an acknowledgment of Mr. Sanders's strength in the three prior contests, Mr. Biden told reporters: ""Whoever wins this primary is going into Super Tuesday very strongly, and I think it's going to be Bernie and me going into Super Tuesday.""

According to entrance polls in Nevada
, Mr. Sanders won nearly every demographic segment—including voters ages 17 to 64, white voters, Latino voters and first time caucus-goers. The only segments he lost to Mr. Biden were black voters, voters over age 65 and voters opposed to a single-payer health-care system. Mr. Sanders supports a program known as Medicare for All.
Mr. Sanders's coalition will be put to the test in the next round of states. In his unsuccessful 2016 primary bid against Hillary Clinton, he struggled to bring in support from minorities.
While Mr. Sanders trails Mr. Biden in South Carolina, a
Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Friday
showed the two men running even among black Democratic primary voters nationally, a crucial part of Mr. Biden's constituency in South Carolina and other Southern states.
Mr. Biden mingled with churchgoers who generally represent his base of support in the primary. Ken Morris, a 68-year-old retired member of the Marine Corps, said he believed Mr. Sanders couldn't win the general election.
""There's not too many people who believe in socialism,"" Mr. Morris said. ""Joe is more centrist. More people trust him. You can't beat a guy who is all the way to the right by going all the way to the left.""
Voters, particularly those who are younger, say Mr. Sanders's ""consistency"" on the issues of health care, climate change and education is why they back him over the rest of the crowded field. Some older voters who were originally skeptical of Mr. Sanders say they see he has the momentum—backed by a swell of enthusiastic young supporters—to win this cycle.
Steve McCormack, a 49-year-old business owner from the Houston suburb of The Woodlands, attended Mr. Sanders's Houston rally on Sunday. Mr. McCormack voted for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio in the 2016 GOP primary and sat out the general election.
But this cycle, Mr. McCormack said is going to vote ""blue no matter who,"" and he believes Mr. Sanders may be the nominee.
""I see it might be going this way"" toward Mr. Sanders winning the primary, he said.
Mr. Sanders is benefiting from a fractured field in which voters are splintered among his more moderate opponents. Mr. Trump enjoyed a similar situation on his way to claiming the Republican nomination in 2016, when much of the GOP establishment argued Mr. Trump would turn off too many voters to win the general election.
Super Tuesday states have had less consistent polling than some of the earlier ones, but Mr. Sanders has led recent polls in delegate-rich California and Texas. He has projected confidence about both states and has said a win in California means he would likely be on his way to the nomination.
On Sunday, author and former Democratic candidate
Marianne Williamson endorsed Mr. Sanders
for president, saying after his victory in Nevada ""the energy is unquestionably with Bernie.""
But some Democrats and groups looking to boost centrists aren't ready to concede the nomination.
""The race is not over, said Jonathan Kott, executive director of the Big Tent Project, which is running ads opposing Mr. Sanders in South Carolina. ""You have a lot of people still in the race, you have a lot of people that could win in different states.""
When asked if nominating Mr. Sanders could put Democrats' House majority in danger, Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, a top member of House Democratic leadership, said on ABC's ""This Week"" that ""a lot of people think so.""
The president's campaign has already signaled it would
tag Democrats as socialists in the general election
, particularly in states like Florida in an attempt to sway Venezuelan- and Cuban-Americans. Mr. Sanders has said his version of democratic socialism is a belief in basic rights for everyone, adding that his policies would be similar to those of former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
After South Carolina, the Democratic field will face former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the approximately $160 million he has spent on television and radio ads across Super Tuesday states, according to data from political-ad tracker Kantar/CMAG. That sum dwarfs that of the next biggest spender, Mr. Steyer. Because Mr. Bloomberg didn't compete in the first four states, Super Tuesday will be the first time candidates face the barrage of ads which could complicate the path for any candidate still in the race.

BURLINGTON, Vt.—Bernie Sanders's hopes of securing the Democratic presidential nomination rely on an unlikely path that would require him to top or tie Joe Biden in states he lost in his 2016 bid, a tough proposition as his momentum in the race wanes.
Mr. Sanders indicated Wednesday that he plans to stay in the race and participate in Sunday's Democratic debate in Phoenix,
despite losing four of the six states that held nominating contests Tuesday
.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How do you think Bernie Sanders will perform in the Florida primary? Join the conversation below.
""I very much look forward to the debate in Arizona with my friend Joe Biden,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""Donald Trump must be defeated.…On Sunday night, in the first one-on-one debate of this campaign, the American people will have the opportunity to see which candidate is best positioned to accomplish that goal.""
But his path to the nomination has grown so difficult that big-money Democratic groups that remained neutral for much of the race have now declared Mr. Biden, the former vice president, the likely nominee. In a speech Tuesday night in Philadelphia, Mr. Biden was already looking ahead to a general election against Mr. Trump, thanking Mr. Sanders and his supporters ""for their tireless energy and their passion.""
Mr. Sanders's loss in Michigan—the biggest delegate prize of the night and a state he won in the 2016 primaries—was a particularly hard-hitting blow because Mr. Sanders has argued that he is the best candidate to beat Mr. Trump in Midwestern states.
The Vermont senator and his campaign are hoping that a strong performance during Sunday's debate, which will take place without a live audience because of coronavirus concerns, will help save his floundering campaign.
""The dynamic of a one-on-one debate is much different than the dynamic of a one-on-10,"" spokesman Mike Casca said. ""We feel that the senator will have enough room in a two-hour debate with one other candidate to really strongly lay out the case for why his agenda is one that can be done.""
But even with a stellar debate performance, aides to Mr. Sanders acknowledge his chances of being the Democratic nominee are slim following Tuesday night's walloping. Next Tuesday, they are hoping for a victory in Arizona, where
roughly one-third of the population is Hispanic
, a demographic with which the Vermont senator has expanded his support this cycle. But Mr. Sanders lost the state by 18 points in 2016 and
recent polling has shown Mr. Biden ahead
.
Aides are also hoping for strong performances, if not outright wins, in Ohio and Illinois. Mr. Sanders lost Ohio by 14 points and Illinois by 2 points in 2016. One poll released this year in Illinois had
Mr. Sanders ahead
of a still-fractured field.
Ohio
hasn't had Democratic primary polling this year.
The result in Michigan appears to bode ill for Mr. Sanders in those nearby states. In the days leading up to the vote in Michigan, Mr. Sanders
all but camped out in the state and moved key aides in
. He increased his criticism of Mr. Biden for supporting trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Biden, however, won by 16.5 points.
Mr. Sanders's aides acknowledge that Florida, which offers the most pledged delegates of the states voting next week and which he lost by 32 points four years ago,
will be difficult
. The self-described Democratic socialist has praised parts of Fidel Castro's legacy, while condemning the oppressive actions of the Cuban dictator,
which hasn't gone over well
with Florida's large Cuban population.
Mr. Sanders's aides, however, point out that California, the largest prize in the entire nominating contest, went for him on March 3 and results are still being tallied, meaning the senator will likely gain more delegates from that primary. Colorado, another state Mr. Sanders won, is also still tabulating results.
Mr. Sanders has said he would support Mr. Biden if the former vice president is the Democratic nominee.
In his remarks Wednesday, Mr. Sanders said while his progressive ideas were popular, he was losing voters who were worried about beating President Trump.
'While our campaign has won the ideological debate, we are losing the debate over electability,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""I cannot tell you how many people our campaign has spoken to who have said, and I quote, 'I like what your campaign stands for, I agree with what your campaign stands for, but I'm gonna vote for Joe Biden because I think Joe is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump.'""
""We have heard that statement all over this country,"" he said.

WASHINGTON—And then there were two.
Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders will face off one-on-one Sunday evening, in a contrast with other Democratic presidential debates that featured as many as 12 candidates onstage at once.
The former vice president comes into the event as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination after dominating a series of state contests over the past two weeks. He has a wide delegate lead that will be hard for the Vermont senator to close.
This debate also marks a location change to the nation's capital—after other debates were held in states that Democrats see as competitive in the general election—because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The Democratic National Committee's debate will be broadcast on CNN at 8 p.m. E.T.
Here is The Wall Street Journal's guide for what to watch:
How do the candidates address coronavirus concerns?
Messrs. Biden and Sanders have tried to contrast President Trump's response to the coronavirus with their own, calling the president's handling of the matter haphazard and not guided by science. Both men are hoping they can benefit in the primary—and in November's general election, whichever of the two wins the nomination—by demonstrating how they would manage such a health crisis and any ensuing economic turmoil.
The former vice president said in a speech Thursday that the U.S. should lead a coordinated global response that prepares hospitals and public-health workers and manages the economic fallout.
Mr. Sanders told reporters in his hometown of Burlington, Vt., on Friday that the lack of access to health care during the pandemic would build political support for Medicare for All, the single-payer system he has proposed. He pledged this week to press Mr. Biden on what he would do to expand health-insurance coverage to all Americans, and he is likely to use the spread of the novel coronavirus to make his point.
The president's re-election campaign has said the Democrats are looking to score political points at a time of crisis.
How does the new format affect the dynamics?
The DNC has pulled the live audience from the debate structure, citing the pandemic. That means there will be no background clapping or booing, as some debate audiences have done in previous rounds.
Messrs. Biden and Sanders have criticized each other's policy proposals, and the Vermont senator said earlier this week that he would press his opponent to explain his positions on a range of issues. But he also described the former vice president as ""my friend Joe Biden.""
One dynamic to look for is how the candidates react to one another without real-time audience engagement to help them understand how certain jabs or jokes are playing.
How does Mr. Biden perform?
Mr. Biden started off his campaign with rocky debate performances that many Democrats have said undercut notions that he was the best prepared to take on Mr. Trump in the fall. His performance has steadied in more recent debates, but rivals had slowed their attacks on him to take on others who were seen as a threat, such as former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, both of whom have since exited the race.
Now that Mr. Biden will undoubtedly have more speaking time, many Democrats will be watching to see whether the former vice president can withstand such sustained scrutiny—and they'll likely be picturing how he'd perform next to Mr. Trump.
Can Mr. Sanders shake up the race?
The race has proved to be extremely volatile, and debates have shaped results before. The best example might be Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar's standout performance in New Hampshire, which helped boost her to third place in the state's primary over Ms. Warren.
Mr. Biden doesn't want to shake up the race. After all, he's ahead and is poised to do well in a diverse set of states coming up that Mr. Sanders lost during his 2016 presidential bid.
Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, is looking for a standout moment that might cause more Democratic voters to reconsider supporting him. If he can't get one, he would likely settle for convincing Mr. Biden to move to the left on some issues.
Do they address the lack of diversity onstage?
For the first time since Democrats started their presidential debates last summer, there will be no women, younger people, nonwhite or gay candidates on the debate stage. That has come as a disappointment to many in the party after beginning the campaign with the most diverse field in its history.
While Mr. Sanders is Jewish, many Democrats will be looking to see how the pair might acknowledge the relative lack of diversity between them. Expect them to make overtures to their minority bases of support, including black Democrats for Mr. Biden and Latinos for Mr. Sanders. The candidates might also be asked by moderators whether they would take demographics into consideration when choosing a vice president, cabinet members or judicial nominees.

WASHINGTON—The
coronavirus crisis
is rapidly changing President Trump's re-election strategy, forcing him into the position of leading the nation through a sprawling, complex emergency while undermining his greatest asset: a strong economy.
Mr. Trump this week has taken steps to demonstrate more command, appearing at daily news conferences and taking a solemn outlook, while his campaign weighs how to contend with battered financial markets and rising unemployment.
""People are going to judge him in this moment—and this moment is going to last for a while,"" said Mike DuHaime, a Republican strategist not involved in the campaign. ""In the beginning he downplayed it too much and that hurt his credibility, but there is a lot of time to go now where he can compensate.""
That is forefront in the thinking of Mr. Trump's campaign advisers. The virus may ease amid extraordinary steps affecting all aspects of everyday life, and the campaign could resume its normal rhythms before Election Day. The situation, though, just as well as could worsen.
Mr. Trump's campaign is banking on the economy bouncing back ahead of the crucial several months before November when voters are paying the most attention, advisers say. It has begun to formulate an argument that Mr. Trump's policies since taking office fueled the economy to new heights, and that he is best equipped to build it up a second time if necessary.
""We will point out that it is under the present policies that it was so vibrant and those policies are still in place,"" campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said. ""The stock market will rebound, and the economy will still be in solid shape.""
This week the main super PAC supporting Mr. Trump's re-election held discussions on possible ads highlighting steps the president has taken to combat the virus, including putting travel restrictions on China, according to a person familiar with the talks.
In recent days Mr. Trump has referred to the ""Chinese virus,"" a term that has been criticized for its racist connotations. His campaign on Wednesday moved to portray him as taking tough actions against a world rival and sought to draw a contrast with Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who is closing in on the Democratic presidential nomination.
The former vice president's campaign observed that the president has praised Chinese President Xi Jinping for his handling of the emergency. Of the Trump campaign's email, which accused Mr. Biden of ""incompetence and misinformation,"" Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo said, ""This is projection, pure and simple—a classic Trump campaign move.""
For now, campaign mechanics—including the rallies that energize Mr. Trump as much as his supporters—are in the background or on hold and the burden largely rests on the president using the White House stage to make his case. His discipline at news conferences this week has pleased advisers, though they privately acknowledge anything can change.
""I think the base will hold with him no matter, but if he does dumb stuff, he won't be able to build on his reach to voters,"" said one adviser.
""Americans typically rally around their president in times of national crisis, and this should be to Donald Trump's benefit,"" said Jeff Horwitt, a Democratic pollster who partners with Republicans on surveys for The Wall Street Journal. ""But Donald Trump is not a typical president. While he has a chance to seize the moment, unite the country and provide presidential leadership, over the past three years he has yet to prove that he is capable of doing so.""
Only a short time ago Mr. Trump was feeling especially confident. He emerged from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and then withstood impeachment. His campaign was running smoothly.
Now those gains are in jeopardy. A Gallup poll released Tuesday showed Mr. Trump's
approval rating was down to 44%
, slipping 5 percentage points and back to pre-impeachment levels. Among independent voters, his approval was down 7 percentage points.
""There is no question that Covid-19 and Trump's disastrous response will be a part of the political conversation for the rest of this campaign,"" said Josh Schwerin, spokesman for Priorities USA, the leading Democratic super PAC that has put its support behind Mr. Biden. Another outside group, Pacronym, said it was prepared to spend up to $5 million on coronavirus ads, and some already on Facebook criticize the administration's slowness to get testing kits to states.
The Trump campaign's tone has changed in the past week, but not its intensity. It has shifted to online training of volunteers who will be crucial to driving out voters and is considering online events featuring surrogates.
The campaign continues to seek donations from supporters daily, through emails, text messages and on social media. The pitches, however, are being modified to match the unity that White House officials are asking of Americans. Campaign officials expect to pause, at least temporarily, the ""fake news"" attacks and its most biting criticism of Democrats, which also tend to bring in the most money. (Mr. Trump himself, however, hasn't stopped leveling such attacks on Twitter.)
An email Wednesday asked surrogates to focus on what the campaign and the White House describe as unprecedented actions taken by the president. One talking point suggests focusing on the power that states now have to authorize laboratories to develop their own coronavirus tests, but doesn't acknowledge that was a response to the dire shortage of tests for the fast-moving virus.
As the crisis was first unfolding, Mr. Trump played it down, suggesting Democrats and the media were hyping the situation. He compared coronavirus to the seasonal flu, and said in January ""we have it totally under control."" Mr. Trump's tone has shifted in recent days. But when asked last week about the virus, only 33% of Mr. Trump's strongest supporters said they believed the worst was yet to come with the virus, compared with 60% of all Americans who said the same, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.
On Wednesday, the campaign's talking points urged surrogates to tell supporters to listen to local and state authorities. The only mention of Mr. Biden: Noting that his
sweep of primary contests
on Tuesday would put pressure on Sen. Bernie Sanders to give up his campaign.
Still, campaign officials and advisers cautioned that the tactics are evolving.
While the campaign is unlikely to run any new ads focused on the economy, as officials were considering earlier this month, some believe those spots could be airing again by the fall. Mr. Trump and his team have careened from one political crisis to the next since the 2016 election, and there has been little change in his approval rating since he took office.
""Look, if in 45 days it looks like everything is going back to normal,"" one adviser said, ""then everything is going to go back to where it was.""

Odds are that Bernie Sanders wins Iowa, Joe Biden wins the Democratic nomination and Donald Trump wins the presidency—but loses the popular vote (again).
Those aren't my predictions. They're Mr. Market's, thanks to a small but busy domestic futures market in election outcomes, as well a robust overseas betting book.
You can pay 43 cents to win $1 if Sen. Sanders wins the Iowa Democratic caucus, and bet 41 cents to get $1 if Mr. Biden wins the party nomination—the priciest options, representing the likeliest outcomes, available at the moment for those races. It'll set you back 48 cents to win $1 if Mr. Trump rides to victory in November, but only 26 cents to bet he wins popular vote.
Across the Atlantic, bookies in the U.K. will give you 6-to-4 odds that Mr. Biden wins the Democratic presidential nomination—bet $1, you'd win it back along with another $1.50—but 3-to-1 odds that Mr. Sanders does. The odds for Mr. Trump winning in November are almost even, at 10-11, compared with 5-6 for a Democrat generally.
The U.K. bets are technically only available to political junkies outside the U.S. The U.S. generally frowns on Las Vegas-style betting over domestic elections. But commodities regulators have given the nod to a few futures markets designed to produce data for researchers, with some limits.
The granddaddy of the field, the
University of Iowa's Iowa Electronic Markets
has been running nationally since the early 1990s. It offers a winner-take-all market on the presidential popular vote (currently favoring the eventual Democratic candidate) and a vote-share market (roughly 55% for the Democrat), as well as markets on Congressional control. A Democratic presidential-primary market is expected to launch soon.
The more polished
PredictIt
, an online market run by New Zealand's Victoria University of Wellington, offers a wider range of election and other political bets, including markets on which Supreme Court justice will step down next (Ruth Bader Ginsburg at 78 cents) and whether the U.S. House will adopt a third article of impeachment before March 31 (5 cents).
Since they exist for research purposes, both markets put a lid on your losses—and potential gains—to some degree. The Iowa market limits total bets to $500. PredictIt limits an individual's investment in any given contract to $850.
In some cases, betting markets can provide nuanced information, says Alex Donohue, a veteran U.K.-based political betting analyst now at betting-information website US-Bookies.com. Odds in the U.K. suggest punters are skeptical that Michael Bloomberg will win the Democratic nomination—but think he's got a decent chance of beating Mr. Trump if he does.
""A lot of times, you'll see buzz in the betting markets that predates buzz in the polling or in the media,"" Mr. Donohue told me.
Meantime, Mr. Trump's odds, at 10 to 11, aren't as impressive as they seem: Barack Obama's odds were 1 to 3 at a similar point in 2012, and George W. Bush was 1 to 2. (Of course, four years ago, the odds were against Mr. Trump 5-to-1.)
""He's in a pretty poor place relative to other incumbents,"" Mr. Donohue said. ""You would expect an incumbent to have shorter odds to win a second term.""
The election markets offer slightly different standings than some other widely watched measures of the presidential horse-race, including fundraising and opinion polling.
End-of-year campaign finance disclosures show
Mr. Trump leading the pack on that front, followed by Mr. Sanders.
Recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News
polling suggests
that Mr. Biden is in the lead nationally for the Democratic nomination, at 28%. About a third of registered voters in the poll said they are almost certain to vote for Mr. Trump in the general election, while 48% said they were almost certain to vote against him; the rest said it depended on the Democratic nominee.

A 2008 paper
found the Iowa market's ability to predict elections outperforms national polls, while
another paper
suggests those most active in trading in the market—price-setters, in market parlance—tend to make fewer mistakes.
The bottom line: These kinds of predictive markets are your best bet for calling election results, especially this far out or when there's a sudden shift—such as a new scandal—that polls don't immediately reflect.
""They provide a full measure of what's likely to happen on an election-by-election basis that's quite useful,"" said David Rothschild, an economist at Microsoft Research who earned his doctorate from Wharton Business School in market design.
""The favorite doesn't always win,"" says Mr. Rothschild. ""No one should look at the betting market and say the most likely outcome will definitely happen.""
Of course, 2016 proved that point.

The end of Sen. Elizabeth Warren's presidential
campaign last week
has left her New York supporters saddened and searching for the next steps as the Democratic field narrows to two major candidates.
Ms. Warren said Thursday that she was suspending her campaign after a lackluster showing in the Super Tuesday primaries. She wasn't victorious in any of the 14 voting states, and finished third in her home state of Massachusetts behind former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, of Vermont.
Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders had been
competing in a side-primary
among the state's progressive officials and institutions. The Working Families Party endorsed Ms. Warren. Some of Mr. Sanders's staunchest supporters, like him, identify as democratic socialists and are active in the Democratic Socialists of America.
By one measure, the WFP and DSA are vying for primacy in progressive circles and the WFP's endorsement of Ms. Warren over Mr. Sanders was off-putting to some voters. Several Sanders supporters vented online after the WFP announced its decision in September.
Most of the people interviewed for this column, though, said they believed any row would quickly be smoothed over.
""Both Warren and Sanders will have important roles in the future of the progressive movement, so I wouldn't say the WFP's out. But there are groups like DSA that will use this to help recruit,"" said Sean McElwee, a DSA member who backs Mr. Sanders and is the executive director of Data for Progress, a progressive think tank.
WFP National Director Maurice Mitchell said in an interview that the party is ""a coalition of progressives, some of which were Bernie supporters and Warren supporters"" and the relationships among them remain ""very, very strong.""
""We think that our record speaks for itself. We point to the work we're doing every single day on really, really, really big issues,"" he said, including races for the New York state Legislature and Congress.
Mr. Mitchell wouldn't say what the party's next step would be, but was clear that ""now is a time for progressives to unite."" Some prominent supporters of Ms. Warren, including New York City Councilman Brad Lander, have already endorsed Mr. Sanders.
But others, like Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou, a Democrat who represents lower Manhattan, are waiting.
""I want to think about what's good for all of us, but right now—I'm in mourning,"" she said.
CUOMO STILL NOT ENDORSING BIDEN: Gov. Andrew Cuomo is so far declining to join moderate Democrats around the country who coalesced behind Mr. Biden after his
strong performance on Super Tuesday
.
Mr. Cuomo, who is Mr. Biden's longtime friend, has been a fair-weather ally during this primary season. When the former vice president first declared his candidacy, Mr. Cuomo said Mr. Biden was the best candidate to defeat President Trump, and people close to the governor said he would do
whatever he could
to help the Biden campaign.
But after some lackluster debate performances, Mr. Cuomo answered questions about Mr. Biden by saying he hadn't endorsed anyone for president. Between the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primaries, Mr. Cuomo demurred when asked if he still believed Mr. Biden was the Democrats' best bet to defeat Mr. Trump.
During a Thursday press conference on the new coronavirus, a reporter asked Mr. Cuomo when he would be ready to endorse Mr. Biden.
""When will I be ready to endorse Joe Biden? So, are you assuming that I will endorse Joe Biden?"" the governor replied.
Some reporters nodded. One retorted, ""So you're considering endorsing Bernie Sanders?"" The comment drew laughs around the room and a smile from Mr. Cuomo, who has said Mr. Sanders's identification as a democratic socialist would be
""a pretty big pill""
for voters to swallow.
""Good comeback,"" Mr. Cuomo said. ""No politics today.""
THE QUESTION: The State Capitol in Albany features carvings and stained glass representing famous New Yorkers, the state's major crops and the seal of which defunct city?
—Know the answer? Leave a comment!
THE LAST ANSWER: Assemblyman Marcos Crespo, a Bronx Democrat who said last month he wouldn't seek re-election in November, started his political career as an intern for the Rev. Ruben Diaz Sr. The reverend is a former state senator who is now a member of the New York City Council and a candidate for Congress.

Orin Kramer, an influential Democratic fundraiser and hedge-fund founder who spent the past year helping Pete Buttigieg, is throwing his weight behind former Vice President Joe Biden.
Mr. Kramer is among several prominent Buttigieg backers who have decided to help Mr. Biden after the former South Bend, Ind., mayor
suspended his presidential campaign
late Sunday. Mr. Buttigieg, who wasn't well-known nationally before his presidential campaign, raised more than $100 million by the time he dropped out.
Virginia Rep. Don Beyer quickly announced his support for Mr. Biden, and other former Buttigieg fundraisers said Monday that they were likely to move to Mr. Biden.
Alex Slater and Harmony Knutson, public-relations professionals in Washington who had been some of Mr. Buttigieg's top fundraisers, said Monday that they also now will help raise money for Mr. Biden.
""Biden is the clear choice to carry the Buttigieg legacy in this campaign,"" Mr. Slater said.
Ms. Knutson said she and other Buttigieg fundraisers reached out to Mr. Biden's finance team late Sunday, and she had spent much of Monday on the phone trying to convince people in her network to give to Mr. Biden.
""They understand the urgency of this and the need to rally behind a candidate in the more moderate lane of the party,"" she said.
Mr. Biden saw a fundraising surge after
his dominant win Saturday
in South Carolina, his first statewide success in three presidential campaigns. He faces
another election test Tuesday
, when 14 states weigh in on what is known as Super Tuesday.
His campaign said he raised more than $11 million after the South Carolina victory. The money comes at a crucial time: Mr. Biden lagged behind rivals Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in January fundraising, Federal Election Commission reports showed, and Mr. Sanders's campaign said he raised more than $46 million in February.
Meanwhile, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who will be on the ballot for the first time Tuesday, has spent more than $620 million of his own money on his bid. He is urging major donors to support him even though he said he doesn't want their money.
Mr. Sanders, who is leading in delegates, isn't courting major Democratic fundraisers, instead relying on smaller online donations.
Mr. Kramer, who worked in the Jimmy Carter White House before founding Boston Provident LP, was an early supporter of Barack Obama's 2008 campaign.

MobilizeAmerica, the digital-organizing firm
used by most Democratic presidential campaigns to coordinate volunteers
, said it is raising $3.75 million as it expands ahead of the 2020 election.
MobilizeAmerica Chief Executive and co-founder Alfred Johnson said the firm raised money from some high-profile progressive technology investors, including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, venture capitalist Chris Sacca's Lowercase Capital and political tech incubator Higher Ground Labs.
""We wanted to make sure that we had enough capital to be able to sustain the business…well past the election,"" said Mr. Johnson, who worked on former President Obama's 2008 campaign. ""In the past, campaigns built these tools internally. If you do that, there are hard-to-learn lessons of growth and scale that you can only learn in an election.""
MobilizeAmerica, which was founded in 2017, operates a centralized sign-up system that helps people connect with Democratic campaigns and progressive organizations to volunteer at events, knock on doors, and call and text voters ahead of elections. Volunteers' information is saved on its website, and they can click through event listings to find other opportunities to pitch in for Democrats.
MobilizeAmerica hopes it can drive around four million people to participate in about 10 million volunteer actions over the next year, Mr. Johnson said. The Republican Party and conservatives don't have a similar platform that is broadly used. Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale has said his operation aims to involve 1.6 million volunteers before the election.
The so-called Series A round of fundraising will go toward expanding MobilizeAmerica's business and boosting its team, Mr. Johnson said. Recent hires include former employees from Google, Facebook and the U.S. Marine Corps. MobilizeAmerica isn't currently profitable.

Shomik Dutta, co-founder and partner at Higher Ground Labs, which led the fundraising round with a $1.25 million investment, said the incubator has encouraged Democratic donors to give money to political tech startups. ""We have to wake up to the fact that technology and infrastructure are meaningful investments,"" he said.

MobilizeAmerica has worked
with 19 Democratic presidential campaigns this cycle, including those of former Vice President Joe Biden; Pete Buttigieg; Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
It is also working with the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic committees that work with Senate and local Democrats as well as state Democratic parties in efforts to reach downballot races. Progressive groups, including SwingLeft, the National Education Association and pro-abortion-rights group Naral, are also on its platform.

Seven Democratic presidential candidates
took the stage
in New Hampshire on Friday night, days ahead of the state's the first-in-the-nation primary next week.
The top finishers in the
Iowa caucuses
this week, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg drew the most attention from their rivals. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose Iowa results fell short of what they'd hoped, tried to make their case to voters across the country. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, billionaire climate activist Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang also shared the debate stage. The candidates squared off over experience and who was best suited to take on President Donald Trump in the general election.
Pete Buttigieg was in opponents' crosshairs.
""We have a newcomer in the White House, and look where it got us.""—Amy Klobuchar
Why this matters: Ms. Klobuchar was citing President Trump's political novelty as she hit Pete Buttigieg over his inexperience compared with the other top Democratic contenders. Ms. Klobuchar and Joe Biden trained their ire on Mr. Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Ind., who appears to have tied with Mr. Sanders to win the Iowa caucuses this week. The trio of more moderate candidates are vying for independents in New Hampshire and center-left Democrats across the country.
As she warned that the country shouldn't take another risk on a political newcomer, Ms. Klobuchar also chided Mr. Buttigieg, ""Mayor Pete, while three of us were jurors in the impeachment hearing, you said you wanted to turn the channel and watch cartoons. It's easy to go after Washington. It's much harder to lead.""
Mr. Buttigieg responded to those kinds of attacks by contrasting himself to the third-term Minnesota senator and Mr. Biden, a senator and vice president for 4½ decades. ""We cannot solve the problems before us by looking back,"" Mr. Buttigieg said.
Bernie Sanders pressed on identifying as a ""democratic socialist.""
""Bernie said he wrote the damn bill, but didn't say how he'll pay for the damn thing.""—Joe Biden
Why this matters: Mr. Biden hammered Mr. Sanders over his refusal to talk about how he would fund his Medicare for All plan. The candidates opened the three-hour debate with a discussion of their health care plans—and immediately showed more willingness to confront each other than in past debates. Early on, a moderator asked the candidates to raise their hands if they thought having a democratic socialist at the top of the ticket was a problem. Ms. Klobuchar appeared to be the only candidate on the stage to do so.
Earlier, Mr. Biden had said that Mr. Trump would apply the label socialist to ""everyone running with Bernie if he's the nominee."" Mr. Sanders responded to such criticism by saying Mr. Trump lies about everything, so it doesn't matter what people worry he might say. He also argued he could bring broad swaths of Americans together by rallying them around more affordable health care and decrying income inequality.
Michael Bloomberg looms large despite not being on stage.
""I don't think anyone ought to be able to buy their way into the nomination or being president of the United States.""—Elizabeth Warren
Why this matters: The debate moderators asked the candidates on stage what they thought about billionaire former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg's self-financed effort to win the Democratic nomination despite sitting out the first four primary contests. Mr. Bloomberg hasn't qualified for any of the debates so far, but the Democratic National Committee recently changed its criteria in such a way that he could be on future stages.
Ms. Klobuchar cited her working-class upbringing and spouted another Trump-themed zinger. ""I don't think people look at the guy in the White House and think, 'Can we get someone richer?'""
A moderator baited Mr. Sanders on the topic by saying the former mayor had said ""we need evolution, not revolution,"" a riff on Mr. Sanders's campaign theme. Mr. Sanders called it ""nonsense"" that Mr. Bloomberg can spend hundreds of millions of dollars on his own campaign, and plugged his 1.5 million donors who had given an average of just over $18 each.
Candidates wrestle with abortion and the Supreme Court.
""I will never nominate any person to the Supreme Court or the federal courts in general who is not 100% pro Roe V. Wade.""—Bernie Sanders
Why This Matters: Other candidates on stage gave sometimes meandering answers to a question about whether they would only nominate Supreme Court judges who would keep abortion legal. ""I would only appoint judges that would respect precedent. And one of those key precedents is Roe v. Wade,"" Ms. Klobuchar said. Mr. Biden gave a lengthy answer about the kinds of justices he had backed in the past.
Mr. Sanders said that he would only nominate justices fully supportive of upholding Roe v. Wade, referring to the 1973 court decision that legalized abortion. Billionaire Tom Steyer said he, too, has a litmus test and argued that all of the candidates were in agreement. ""Everybody on this row feels exactly the same way about a woman's right to choose,"" he said.
Candidates forced to disavow their own surrogates
""I believe he's sorry for what he said.""—Joe Biden
Why this matters: Mr. Steyer confronted Mr. Biden over a remark that his longtime friend and campaign surrogate in South Carolina Dick Harpootlian made. Mr. Harpootlian, a Democratic state senator, said the head of the state's black legislative caucus only backed Mr. Steyer because he was paid to do so, something other black lawmakers decried as a racist remark. Mr. Harpootlian denies that his comment was racially motivated, according to the Associated Press, and on the debate stage, Mr. Biden said he'd spoken to Mr. Harpootlian and believed he was sorry.
Soon after, a debate moderator asked Mr. Sanders about an opinion piece his campaign co-chair Nina Turner wrote asserting that Mr. Biden has ""repeatedly betrayed black voters."" Mr. Sanders said he did not agree with Ms. Turner's assessment. ""Joe Biden is a friend of mine, and I'm not here to attack him,"" he said.

LAS VEGAS—Joe Biden has made the case for months that he can best appeal to black, Latino and moderate voters. But after the Nevada caucuses, Bernie Sanders is the one beginning to show the makings of a broad electoral coalition.
The Vermont senator's
decisive victory Saturday
was powered by a diverse set of voters, including overwhelming support among Latinos and young people drawn to his calls for an expansive government-run health care program and the elimination of student debt.
Mr. Sanders's ability to build upon that coalition will help dictate whether he is able to prevent the former vice president from notching a victory on Feb. 29 in South Carolina, where
black voters
make up more than half of the Democratic electorate. If Mr. Sanders edges Mr. Biden out there, he could be poised for a dominant run on March 3, when
a series of contests
including the diverse states of California, Texas and North Carolina will award about one-third of the delegates for the nomination.
""In Nevada, we have just put together a multi-generational, multi-racial coalition which is not only going to win in Nevada, it's going to sweep this country,"" Mr. Sanders said in San Antonio on Saturday night.
Mr. Biden took the stage at a Las Vegas union hall as results trickled in, seizing upon projections of a second-place finish—albeit distant—that he said would revitalize his campaign. By Sunday morning, he was at a Baptist church in North Charleston, S.C., opening a weeklong push to win the primary.
Beyond his connection with diverse voters, Mr. Biden's electability pitch has also centered on his ability to persuade suburban voters and disaffected Republicans in general election battleground states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.
Mr. Biden's campaign manager, Greg Schultz, said that despite Mr. Sanders's victories in New Hampshire and Nevada, he had not been able to generate the surges in voting that the senator has promised would help him beat President Trump in the November election.
""Their campaign continues to say, directly and indirectly, look at turnout, look at turnout, look at turnout,"" Mr. Schultz said. ""And in none of the first three contests has there been this surge in turnout in what they think is their greatest asset.""
Nevada's Democratic Party said about 75,000 people voted early ahead of Saturday's primaries, and turnout was expected to surpass the 85,000 who participated in 2016. But it was unclear if it would exceed the 118,000 who caucused in 2008. New Hampshire's turnout was higher than primaries in 2008 and 2016, while Iowa's turnout cleared the 2016 race there but fell short of 2008 numbers.
Entrance polls in Nevada showed Mr. Sanders capturing about half of Hispanic voters and triumphing among those with college degrees and without, union and non-union households and every age group except those age 65 and older, who supported Mr. Biden. The former vice president was backed by about one third of African-American voters, giving him an edge over Mr. Sanders, who was backed by about one quarter of black voters.
Maria Cardona, a Democratic strategist who isn't affiliated with a presidential campaign, credited Mr. Sanders with cultivating strong ties with the Latino community since the 2016 election, particularly among young people and millennials. She noted that since the last election, four million Latinos have turned age 18, giving Mr. Sanders a significant advantage that he could take into a general election.
""Sanders has done a really good job of transforming the electability argument. And the pendulum is swinging toward him right now,"" she said.
Mr. Biden's message focuses on protecting the Obamacare health care law he helped pass alongside President Obama and his work to curb gun violence.
Both issues sought to draw bright lines with Mr. Sanders, who has advocated for a Medicare-for-all health care overhaul that would eventually eliminate the private insurance system and who voted against legislation to institute background checks for gun purchases.
Days before the caucuses, Mr. Biden delivered a speech that emphasized Mr. Sanders's past support for providing gun manufacturers with protections from lawsuits, a position that the Vermont senator has since recanted.
After crippling losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, Mr. Biden will try to use his second-place finish in Nevada to help convince voters in South Carolina that he can serve as a more moderate alternative to Mr. Sanders.
South Carolina has long been viewed as a firewall for the Biden campaign. Depending on his performance, it could serve as a springboard into delegate-rich states or Mr. Biden's political Waterloo as he seeks the presidency for the third time.
""I think he does have momentum,"" Mr. Biden said of Mr. Sanders after attending church services Sunday in predominantly black North Charleston, S.C. But he added: ""Whoever wins this primary is going into Super Tuesday very strongly, and I think it's going to be Bernie and me going into Super Tuesday.""

WASHINGTON—Sen. Bernie Sanders collected $34.5 million in the fourth quarter, outpacing former Vice President Joe Biden, as both Democratic presidential candidates reported a fundraising surge with one month to go until the Iowa caucuses.
While Democrats brace for a costly—and potentially lengthy—primary season, Republican President Trump faces no significant intraparty opposition and continued to amass campaign cash. His campaign said it raised $46 million in the final three months of last year, its best fundraising quarter to date, and had a war chest of about $103 million.
The Democratic field's quarterly tallies so far more than double Mr. Trump's haul. But unlike the incumbent president, the Democratic hopefuls are entering a period of heavy spending in a primary still crowded with 14 candidates, even after
the exit of former Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development Julián Castro on Thursday.
Mr. Biden said he raised $22.7 million in the fourth quarter, his best number of the year. Mr. Biden, who has relied on larger donors who pay to attend fundraising events, told supporters in a video posted Thursday that his online contributions have increased.
Several other candidates have released their quarterly totals in recent days. Pete Buttigieg, the former South Bend, Ind., mayor, said Wednesday that
he had raised $24.7 million
, while tech entrepreneur and political newcomer Andrew Yang said Thursday that he raised $16.5 million, a sharp increase from the third quarter. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard raised $3.4 million in the fourth quarter, according to her campaign.
Another top contender, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, hasn't disclosed her fourth-quarter haul but said in
a fundraising plea last week
that she had raised $17 million headed into the final days of the quarter, a slowed pace from her third quarter, when she brought in $24.6 million.
None of the Democratic candidates have released their current cash on hand. All presidential campaigns must report fourth-quarter fundraising and spending activities to the Federal Election Commission by Jan. 31.
The Iowa caucuses are Feb. 3, and the New Hampshire primary is Feb. 11. The Democratic field also faces a potential shake-up deeper into the voting calendar, when former New York Mayor
Michael Bloomberg begins competing
in the states that vote March 3, a date known as Super Tuesday. The billionaire businessman entered the race just before Thanksgiving and has already spent $132 million on TV and radio commercials, according to advertising tracker Kantar/CMAG.
Mr. Biden was embarking on a bus tour of eastern Iowa on Thursday, boosted by the endorsement earlier in the day of Rep. Abby Finkenauer (D., Iowa), the first member of the state's congressional delegation to endorse a 2020 candidate. Meanwhile, Mr. Sanders unveiled a new campaign bus and recently increased his TV commercial bookings, according to Kantar/CMAG.
Mr. Sanders's latest haul, which is expected to lead the Democratic pack, is the most that any 2020 Democratic candidate has raised in a single quarter, and highlights the strength of his small-dollar fundraising operation. The Vermont senator has raised about $96 million since entering the race in February, through five million donations that averaged $18, his campaign said.
Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have sworn off events where they woo donors who can give the legal maximum of $2,800. Instead, they are counting on an army of smaller contributors who give online. That is also how Mr. Sanders funded his 2016 bid, when he raised more than $230 million but lost the primary to Hillary Clinton.
Mr. Biden has raised $59.5 million since his late April kickoff. Mr. Biden's campaign said its average contribution amount for the fourth quarter was $41.
Mr. Trump's campaign didn't share information about its average donation size, but he has done well with small online donors in addition to bigger givers. In all, his campaign raised about $143 million last year.
His incumbency enables him to ask individual donors for as much as $360,600 each, money that gets doled out to both his own campaign and to his fundraising partners: the Republican National Committee and state GOP parties. The campaign didn't disclose the joint fundraising totals on Thursday.
The eventual Democratic nominee will also be able to create a bigger-ticket fundraising operation.
Sitting presidents almost always enjoy strong fundraising for re-election. Former President Barack Obama raised about $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, and former President George W. Bush raised $47.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Mr. Bush's campaign had almost $100 million in available cash at the start of his re-election year, the FEC reports show.
Mr. Trump gave himself an advantage by kicking off his re-election campaign the day he was inaugurated. While recent presidents typically have waited until their third year in office to return to the campaign trail, Mr. Trump immediately arranged to fundraise for re-election and never stopped holding the large political rallies that helped him win office in 2016.

DES MOINES, Iowa—After a day of confusion and recriminations over a
technical mishap that snarled the vote count
, the first wave of delayed results from
Iowa's presidential caucuses
showed Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders at the top of the Democratic pack.
The early numbers, representing nearly three-quarters of precincts, suggested a possible split verdict that could have one candidate winning the popular vote and another securing the most delegates, the measure state and national party officials have said should determine the victor.
A close finish between Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, would also underscore the larger Democratic primary battle between progressives and more-moderate candidates in a field still totaling close to a dozen.
More broadly, the muddled results and fallout from the chaotic count stoked tensions among the candidates and concerns among party officials that the process is doing little to find a strong nominee who can unite the party.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, a longtime front-runner who has built his campaign on the idea that he is that candidate, appeared headed for a
worse-than-expected finish
. He is competing with Mr. Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota among the more moderate candidates, and the Iowa results suggest he was beaten by someone in Mr. Buttigieg who was barely known a year ago and who has never governed anything larger than a city of about 100,000 people.

Full Results

The moderate contenders also face a growing challenge from billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who wasn't on the ballot but who has risen in polls after spending several hundred million dollars on advertising. He said on Tuesday that he would
further step up spending and hiring.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, representing the more liberal wing of the party, was below Mr. Buttigieg in the early results but above Mr. Biden.
Ms. Klobuchar, who frequently says on the campaign trail that she has never lost an election since fourth grade, appeared headed for a fifth-place finish in Iowa.
Though the state's population is small and not very diverse, Iowa's caucuses have had a reasonably good record in recent history of picking the eventual winner of the Democratic nomination: Al Gore in 2000, John Kerry in 2004, Barack Obama in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. The caucuses have been less predictive among Republicans in recent election cycles.
There are indications the Democratic Party is unlikely to resolve its debate over candidates and vision soon. All four of the top candidates heading into the caucuses had campaign war chests large enough to sustain them through February, including the
New Hampshire primary next week.

A self-described democratic socialist, Mr. Sanders has recently shown strength in national polls. That has triggered concerns among centrist Democrats who worry President Trump, a Republican, would use Mr. Sanders's political identity to damage the party's prospects in November.
The release of the results followed a brief news conference Tuesday afternoon with Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price, who said the nearly- one-day delay for even partial results was unacceptable and happened because of ""multiple reporting challenges"" as about 1,700 precincts began to feed results into state party headquarters.
Mr. Price declined to say when all of the state's results would be made public. ""We're going to take the time we need,"" he said.
The state party is collecting paper records completed during the precinct meetings. It has attributed the holdup to a software glitch that triggered inconsistencies in data obtained from a mobile app used to report vote tallies.
""We know this data is accurate,"" Mr. Price said. ""We also have a paper trail.""
With 71% of precincts reporting, Mr. Buttigieg had the largest share of delegates to the state party convention, while Mr. Sanders had the second most. But Mr. Sanders led in the raw vote so far, followed by Mr. Buttigieg.
Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden were third and fourth, respectively, in both counts.
Mr. Buttigieg, a 38-year-old openly gay man who is the youngest in the race, could see a bump following what appears to be the best showing of any moderate. He has positioned himself as a voice for generational change—most of his top opponents are septuagenarians—who is willing to work across the political aisle.
In New Hampshire, Mr. Buttigieg has also recorded strong support in polls, but he faces a stiffer challenge in the more ethnically diverse states of Nevada and South Carolina this month, as he has so far received virtually no support in polls from black and Latino voters.
The muddled reporting gave all the top candidates room to frame the result as a win. Speaking to reporters Tuesday evening in New Hampshire after the release of some Iowa results, Mr. Buttigieg was asked what it would mean to his candidacy if he ends up finishing in second or third place. ""It still amounts to an astonishing victory for our vision,"" he said.
In a statement, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders called the early numbers gratifying. ""In the partial data released so far, it's clear that in the first and second round more people voted for Bernie than any other candidate in the field,"" Jeff Weaver said.
Ms. Warren said at her first New Hampshire event on Tuesday, ""We know that three of us will be dividing up most of the delegates coming out of Iowa. I'm feeling good.""

Mr. Biden, during an appearance in Nashua, N.H., expressed optimism after arriving from Iowa. ""It's like my mother said, 'Hope springs eternal,'"" Mr. Biden said. ""We're not giving up.""
State party officials in Nevada, where the second caucus of the nominating season will be held, on Feb. 22, pledged that they wouldn't experience the same failures as Iowa.
""We will not be employing the same app or vendor used in the Iowa caucus,"" Nevada State Democratic Party Chair William McCurdy said in a statement. ""We had already developed a series of backups and redundant reporting systems, and are currently evaluating the best path forward.""
Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said the app that misfired in Iowa wouldn't be used in any other state, either.
""What happened last night should never happen again,"" Mr. Perez said. ""We have staff working around the clock to assist the Iowa Democratic Party to ensure that all votes are counted.""

Do you expect either Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders to have an advantage in the New Hampshire primary? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
Meanwhile, Mr. Trump pounced on the uncertainty, calling the Democratic caucuses an ""unmitigated disaster"" in a Tuesday morning tweet, ahead of his State of the Union address that evening.
The reporting was complicated in this year's caucuses by additional data. In response to calls for greater transparency following the close 2016 contest between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton, the state party was to release for the first time the raw total for votes from both rounds of voting, along with the traditional share of delegates won.
Mr. Sanders has been ahead of his rivals in recent state polls in New Hampshire, but Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg have been within striking distance.
New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley said it is ""highly unusual to have at this point so many competitive campaigns. Usually we are down to three at the most.""
