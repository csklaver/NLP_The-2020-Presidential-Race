| Jump to first hitSuccessful in raising small contributions online and six-figure ones from wealthy donors, the campaign now wants to tap into supporters who can ""bundle"" contributions from friends and business associates.President Trump's re-election campaign plans to step up its efforts to capitalize on so-called bundlers, supporters who can raise money from friends and business associates in increments up to $2,800, the legal limit for a level of giving that has lagged in the campaign despite a far more sophisticated fund-raising operation than existed in 2016.The campaign has excelled at small-dollar fund-raising online and at raising six-figure donations from wealthy individuals and corporations for a joint-effort fund-raising arrangement between the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee.But there has been little effort to cultivate bundlers who can gather donations from a network of friends and associates that can go directly to a candidate's campaign.Mitt Romney and George W. Bush, who ran for president before legal changes allowed joint committees to accept six-figure checks, were prodigious fund-raisers who tended to their bundling networks, ranking them based on the amount they had raised and rewarding the bundlers with names like ""Pioneers"" and ""Ramblers"" and giving them special access at retreats and other events.""In this environment, you should have a program for every segment of the giving community,"" said Scott Reed, the campaign manager for Senator Bob Dole's presidential race in 1996.Mr. Trump has never appreciated the need for that kind of fund-raising, in part because of his disdain for the type of attention that donors expect in return, advisers have said.The president's fund-raising has also benefited from the legal changes in 2014 that allow his political operation to collect six-figure checks by joint committees with the Republican Party -- options not available to Republican candidates before Mr. Trump.But the move to focus more on bundlers comes as Mr. Trump has been increasingly concerned by how much his potential Democratic opponents are spending, particularly Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York City mayor who estimates he has spent several hundred million dollars so far on his campaign and is prepared to spend as much as a billion dollars in all.Mr. Trump's team has named Kimberly Guilfoyle, the former Fox News personality and girlfriend of the president's oldest son who has also become a top campaign surrogate, as the national chairwoman for the Trump Victory Finance Committee.Among her roles will be overseeing the bundler program, which started in May and is set to get more structure, as the campaign heads toward the general election in the fall.Ms. Guilfoyle said in an interview that there were already new donors who have approached her at events she has done around the country for Mr. Trump who were looking for a point of contact for their giving.""I want to give them the confidence that their money is going to be put to excellent use,"" she said, noting that for many people, ""this is the first time that they've written a check to a politician.""Ms. Guilfoyle, the former wife of Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, has an extensive Rolodex in that state and in New York, where donors to previous Republican candidates have been generally cool to Mr. Trump, particularly donors who supported Mr. Romney, the party's presidential nominee in 2012.But she said she was also looking to develop new bundlers who could keep building on the campaign's network.""Kimberly uniquely unites all elements of the Trump coalition, and it is a reflection of the importance the Trump family places on the fund-raising program,"" said Jack Oliver, a bundler for Mr. Bush.For the past year, the question of how much the president might need such ""hard dollar"" checks has been a source of debate and, at times, contention among his aides. But there has been little effort to cultivate people who can gather checks in increments of $2,800 at a rapid clip, according to multiple campaign advisers.Last spring, allies of the president urged Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser who is directing Mr. Trump's campaign from the White House, to do more to cultivate bundlers.But it became an issue in the rivalry between Mr. Kushner and Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee.More recently, the two have reached a détente, according to people close to the campaign. Still, the fund-raising concerns remain, and Mr. Kushner has said he wished some of the top fund-raisers who were rewarded by the president with ambassadorships were still able to raise money, according to two people familiar with his statements.Mr. Trump's campaign has repeatedly highlighted its fund-raising numbers, referring to them as ""staggering"" in a recent news release. The president began the year with close to $200 million in cash on hand between his campaign, the Republican National Committee and other affiliated entities. The groups raised just over a collective $460 million in 2019.This past week, thanks to joint fund-raising agreements between the campaign, the national committee and 22 state parties, the Trump political operation increased the maximum contribution it could accept to $580,600 per person, giving wealthy donors the ability to park more of their money with the Trump re-election effort.But some of the money that goes to the committee is restricted to specific uses, while the hard-dollar money can be used for broader purposes, like staff, advertising and field operations.PhotographSupporters of President Trump this month at a ""Keep America Great"" rally in Toledo, Ohio.

| Jump to first hitRoughly 80 members of Congress, cabinet secretaries and administration officials will descend on the state to drive voter enthusiasm and make a show of force.WASHINGTON -- The Iowa caucuses on Monday will be a competitive race for only one party, the Democrats, but President Trump's campaign does not see it that way.Roughly 80 cabinet secretaries, administration officials and members of Congress will descend on the state that day to drive voter enthusiasm and make a show of force intended to jolt whoever emerges as the Democratic caucus winner.The surrogates will include two former presidential candidates who once campaigned against Mr. Trump in Iowa: Housing Secretary Ben Carson and Rick Perry, the former energy secretary.Mr. Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, as well as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will fan out to speak to Iowa voters at various caucus sites. A group of Trump loyalists from the House -- including Representatives Elise Stefanik of New York, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Matt Gaetz of Florida -- will also be on the ground to make their case for Mr. Trump, the campaign announced Tuesday.They will be joined by a host of loyal ""formers,"" including Mr. Trump's former 2016 campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski; the former White House communications director, Bill Shine; and Matthew Whitaker, an Iowa native who briefly served as the acting attorney general.""Our Caucus Day operation is just a preview of what is to come,"" said Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump's 2020 campaign manager. ""This will be the strongest, best funded and most organized presidential campaign in history. We are putting the Democrats on notice: good luck trying to keep up with this formidable re-election machine.""The idea is to show off a deep well of support for Mr. Trump even as Democrats are choosing their nominee in a nail-biter of a contest that will help whoever emerges as the winner and determine the shape of the rest of the party's primary fight.Senator Bernie Sanders, the crowd-drawing independent from Vermont, has placed first in Iowa in a series of polls, and Mr. Trump has recently been seeking to elevate his candidacy. Mr. Trump has also been focused on Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, who is running a parallel effort in the states that will vote on Super Tuesday on March 3 and skip Iowa altogether.Incumbents -- and party nominees -- often try to swamp early states where their opponents are campaigning by flying in government officials who volunteer their personal time for the campaign, along with lawmakers and aides. But Mr. Trump's show of force is still unusual.""I'm even pleasantly taken aback by this over-the-top interest in Iowa,"" said Jeff Kaufmann, the chairman of the Iowa Republican Party. ""This is about making a statement on the part of the president.""Mr. Trump placed second in Iowa in 2016, after Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. This time around, two Republican challengers, Joe Walsh, a former Illinois congressman, and Bill Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts, have failed to make any dent in Mr. Trump's support from Republican voters.But the Trump campaign said their showing in Iowa was less about two opponents it has been studiously ignoring and more about recruiting volunteers and small-dollar donors, with whom they will continue to engage through November.""Strategically, it's important for Trump surrogates to be in Iowa to consume some of the media coverage,"" said David Bossie, who was Mr. Trump's deputy campaign manager in 2016 and plans to participate in the Iowa offensive. ""We want to plant the flag, because we are looking ahead to the general election.""Mr. Bossie said it would be a mistake to ignore a battleground state simply because there was no competitive primary on the Republican side.""I don't think anybody on that plane is worried about Bill Weld,"" added Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union. ""This campaign is always on offense; it's on its front foot. It doesn't give Democrats a day to do their own thing.""Mr. Trump himself is expected in Des Moines for a rally on Thursday night, a move Mr. Kaufmann compared to President Ronald Reagan showing up in Iowa during his re-election campaign in 1984.""Back then, he had no competition in the caucus, but he made it a statement that he's not taking Iowa for granted,"" Mr. Kaufmann said. ""For all practical purposes, this is the beginning of the general election.""PhotographHousing Secretary Ben Carson is one of the former presidential candidates who will travel to Iowa to support President Trump.

| Jump to first hitIn lashing out at the prosecution of Roger Stone and ""dirty cops,"" the president confronted the attorney general with a choice about how to respond.WASHINGTON -- President Trump once again berated the ""dirty cops"" of the law enforcement establishment on Thursday, accusing the Justice Department of going after his friends but not his enemies in an outburst that flouted Attorney General William P. Barr's pleas to stop publicly intervening in prosecutions where he had a personal interest.Speaking out hours after his friend Roger J. Stone Jr. was sentenced to more than three years in prison for lying to protect the president, Mr. Trump belittled the case and hinted broadly that he would use his clemency power to spare Mr. Stone if a judge did not agree to a retrial sought by defense lawyers.In essentially dangling a pardon or a commutation for a friend, Mr. Trump confronted Mr. Barr with a choice about how to respond after he declared last week that the president's attacks on the criminal justice system were making his job ""impossible.""""A lot of bad things are happening, and we're cleaning it out,"" Mr. Trump said of law enforcement at a Las Vegas event for former convicts re-entering society. ""We're cleaning the swamp. We're draining the swamp. I just never knew how deep the swamp was.""He added: ""We had a lot of dirty cops. F.B.I. is phenomenal. I love the people in the F.B.I. But the people at the top were dirty cops.""Mr. Barr last week reversed the Justice Department's original request, in line with federal guidelines, for a term of seven to nine years for Mr. Stone, leading four career prosecutors to quit the case and one to resign from the department altogether.But even as he agreed with Mr. Trump that the sentencing recommendation was excessive, he went on ABC News to publicly ask the president to stop commenting because ""I cannot do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me.""Mr. Trump later agreed that he was making Mr. Barr's job harder but indicated he would not stay quiet.While Mr. Trump again erupted on Thursday, some in Mr. Barr's camp took solace in the fact that the president did not directly attack the judge in the case, Amy Berman Jackson, the prosecutors or the sentence itself and that he said he admired the F.B.I. rank and file, even though he continued to target its current and former leadership.Mr. Barr has come to recognize that he may never be able to keep Mr. Trump quiet altogether and so in parsing the president's latest comments, the attorney general and his team chose to see them as progress and an opportunity to work out their differences without further public exchange.Mr. Barr, who has suggested to associates that he may have to resign if the president keeps tweeting about individual prosecutions, stayed silent after Mr. Trump's remarks, and the department declined to comment.Over the last week, some of Mr. Trump's closest Republican allies in Congress, including Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and some of the president's favorite Fox News commentators have been trying to smooth over the rift by vouching for Mr. Barr and urging the president to let the legal process play out, according to people familiar with the matter.After the judge sentenced Mr. Stone on Thursday, Mr. Graham noted on Twitter that the term was ""on the lower end"" and emphasized that a president could always grant clemency. He urged that there be no undue interference in legal cases -- without quite saying whom he was addressing.""It is important to give both the government and the accused a fair trial free from influence,"" Mr. Graham wrote. ""I believe this has been accomplished in Mr. Stone's case. Like all Americans, Mr. Stone can appeal the fairness of his trial and the verdict rendered. Under our system of justice President Trump has all the legal authority in the world to review this case, in terms of commuting the sentence or pardoning Mr. Stone for the underlying offense.""Mr. Trump's critics maintained that extending clemency to Mr. Stone would amount to self-dealing for a president who stood to benefit from the convicted adviser's lies about connections to WikiLeaks, which disseminated Democratic emails stolen by Russian agents to damage Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign.""Roger Stone was found guilty of lying to Congress and threatening a witness,"" said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, the panel that Mr. Stone was convicted of obstructing. ""He did it to cover up for Trump. His sentence is justified. It should go without saying, but to pardon Stone when his crimes were committed to protect Trump would be a breathtaking act of corruption.""In his speech on Thursday, Mr. Trump dismissed the significance of Mr. Stone's crimes. He complained that the Justice Department prosecuted his friend for lying and obstructing a congressional inquiry, but did not charge his enemies like Mrs. Clinton, the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey, Mr. Comey's onetime deputy Andrew G. McCabe or the former F.B.I. officials Lisa Page and Peter Strzok.""What happened to him is unbelievable,"" Mr. Trump said of Mr. Stone. ""They say he lied. But other people lied, too. Just to mention, Comey lied. McCabe lied. Lisa Page lied. Her lover, Strzok, Peter Strzok, lied. You don't know who these people are? Just trust me, they all lied.""He went on to revive the email case involving Mrs. Clinton. ""Hillary Clinton leaked more classified documents than any human being, I believe, in the history of the United States,"" he said. But, he added, ""nothing happened to her.""In repeating his attacks on his favorite targets, Mr. Trump distorted or misstated the facts. Mrs. Clinton was not accused of leaking classified documents, much less the most in history. She was investigated for using a private computer server that was not as secure as a government server to send emails, some of which were later found to include classified information.Mr. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, faulted her for carelessness but said ""no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case."" His surprise announcement that he was briefly reopening the investigation days before the 2016 election has been blamed by many Democrats for contributing to Mrs. Clinton's defeat.By contrast, Mr. Trump mocked the case against Mr. Stone, including the witness intimidation charge. ""It's not like the tampering that I see on television when you watch a movie,"" the president said. ""That's called tampering -- with guns to people's heads and lots of other things.""He repeated his assertion that the jury forewoman in Mr. Stone's case was ""totally tainted"" and an ""anti-Trump activist,"" which he said should compel the judge to order a new trial. The Justice Department opposes a new trial, a position approved by Mr. Barr.Mr. Trump left the strong impression, however, that he would use his clemency power if the judge did not go along with the defense motion, saying that he would ""love to see Roger exonerated.""""I'm going to watch the process. I'm going to watch it very closely,"" Mr. Trump added. ""And at some point, I'll make a determination. But Roger Stone and everybody has to be treated fairly, and this has not been a fair process. OK?""Charlie Savage and Katie Benner contributed reporting.PhotographAttorney General William P. Barr has said the president's attacks on the criminal justice system were making his job ""impossible.""

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump, in a tweet Tuesday night, expressed his full-throated endorsement of the man running against his former attorney general in a runoff election for the state's primary.President Trump on Tuesday night endorsed Tommy Tuberville, the former college football coach who won the most votes in last week's Republican primary for the Senate seat from Alabama and is locked in a runoff against Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general.The endorsement came after Mr. Trump agreed to sit on the sidelines during the crowded primary, which had become a show of which candidate displayed more fealty to the president. Mr. Tuberville received the most votes, and polls show him with a comfortable lead heading into the runoff against Mr. Sessions, which is scheduled for March 31.""Tommy was a terrific head football coach at Auburn University,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. ""He is a REAL LEADER who will never let MAGA/KAG, or our Country, down! Tommy will protect your Second Amendment (which is under siege), is strong on Crime and the Border, and truly LOVES our Military and our Vets. He will be a great Senator for the people of Alabama. Coach Tommy Tuberville, a winner, has my Complete and Total Endorsement. I love Alabama!""The endorsement had been a possibility since the end of the primary, during which Mr. Trump had agreed to requests from some Republicans to stay on the sidelines. His reward was being able to criticize Mr. Sessions once it was over -- something he did the day after the primary took place.Mr. Sessions, who formerly held a Senate seat in Alabama, had left that post to join the Trump administration as the president's first attorney general. But Mr. Trump never forgave Mr. Sessions, a campaign surrogate in 2016, for recusing himself from the investigation into whether there was a conspiracy between Russian officials and the Trump campaign.After publicly humiliating Mr. Sessions for 18 months, Mr. Trump fired him in late 2018.Mr. Tuberville has had his own bar to clear: He said in a campaign appearance in August 2019 that he was ""pissed off"" at Mr. Trump over health care for veterans, a video of which has circulated in recent weeks and which Mr. Sessions used in a campaign ad. Since then, Mr. Tuberville has praised Mr. Trump and equated him to a head coach getting insufficient information from assistants.In a primary campaign ad when he entered the race, Mr. Sessions lavished praise on Mr. Trump and highlighted that he had endorsed the president early in his 2016 presidential campaign.The runoff winner will face the incumbent, Senator Doug Jones, a Democrat, in November. Mr. Jones is seen as one of the most, if not the most, vulnerable Democrats in the Senate, and the race is being closely watched as the party tries to reclaim the majority from the Republicans.PhotographTommy Tuberville will face Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general, in a run-off election for Senate in Alabama this month.

| Jump to first hitWhen the House votes to send articles of impeachment to the Senate, it sets off a series of choreographed steps -- some well-defined, others up for debate -- that will shape the Senate trial.WASHINGTON -- The House intends to vote this week to send its articles of impeachment against President Trump to the Senate, prompting only the third impeachment trial of a president in American history.The vote will put to rest nearly a month of uncertainty over when a trial might begin and quickly turn over to the Senate a historic debate over whether Mr. Trump committed what the Constitution describes as ""high crimes and misdemeanors.""The Republican-led Senate is all but certain to vote eventually to acquit Mr. Trump. But the path forward remains murky, with few historical precedents and scant constitutional guidance to light the way. While decades-old congressional rules will be dusted off in the coming days, other, potentially grave decisions that could color the outcome of the trial will be settled on the fly.Here is how we expect things to play out on Capitol Hill in the coming days and weeks.First up: naming managers and a vote to press charges.The House passed two articles of impeachment nearly along party lines on Dec. 18, after a monthslong Democratic inquiry. The articles charged Mr. Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in connection with a scheme to enlist a foreign power for help in the 2020 election. They accused him of using his presidency to pressure Ukraine to investigate his Democratic political rivals, by withholding a White House meeting and nearly $400 million in military aid as leverage.Now, to move forward after nearly a month of delay, the House has to vote to approve a team of a half-dozen or so lawmakers to serve as prosecutors, or managers, and formally press charges in the Senate. A vote is expected Tuesday or Wednesday.Speaker Nancy Pelosi will most likely unveil her roster of managers before the vote, but she is still trying to assemble a diverse group of lawmakers suited to the task. One thing is clear: The team will almost certainly be led by Representatives Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.'Hear ye, hear ye': The opening of the Senate's trial is largely scripted by precedent and rules.The House vote will initiate a carefully choreographed dance, filled with pomp, circumstance and arcane procedural flourishes, between the House and Senate.It begins with each chamber sending up a flare of sorts. The House first notifies the Senate it has appointed managers. The Senate responds that it is ready to receive them and exhibit the articles of impeachment.After that, the House managers will march from their chamber across the Capitol, through the elaborately painted Rotunda under the dome, to the Senate chamber, to deliver a bound copy of the impeachment articles to senators assembled for the occasion.Once the managers arrive, the Senate sergeant-at-arms will cry out ""Hear ye! Hear ye!"" and give senators a warning to stay quiet:All persons are commanded to keep silence, on pain of imprisonment, while the House of Representatives is exhibiting to the Senate of the United States articles of impeachment against Donald John Trump, president of the United States.One of the managers will then read aloud and in full the House's two articles from the well of the Senate, before the whole team leaves.Swearing of oaths: The chief justice arrives on the scene.Next, senators will escort Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. into the Senate chamber. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the president pro tem of the Senate -- the longest-serving Republican -- will administer an oath to Chief Justice Roberts, who will swear to administer ""impartial justice."" Then Chief Justice Roberts will ask senators to raise their right hands and agree to the same oath:I solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John Trump, president of the United States, now pending, I will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws: So help me God.Each senator then must step up, one by one, to sign his or her name in a book attesting to the oath.After that, the Constitution dictates little about how the proceeding should run. It does specify that in presidential impeachments, the chief justice presides for the remainder of the trial.Senate rules in force for three decades dictate that the chamber meets for an impeachment trial every day at 1 p.m., Monday through Saturday, until senators reach a verdict or dismiss the charges.Then comes the haggling.Once they are under oath, senators' first order of business will be wrangling over rules and procedures that dictate the structure of the trial, including whether and when witnesses can be called and documents admitted into evidence. The outcome will set the tone for the coming weeks.Only a simple majority, 51 senators, must agree to set these terms, so Republicans, who hold the Senate majority, come in with a clear advantage.During President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial in 1999, senators came together in the Old Senate Chamber to agree on a set of rules to get the trial underway that both sides could support. The rules passed 100 to 0.This time will be far more partisan. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has said he has the votes to push through a rules package based on the one that governed Mr. Clinton's. But he has yet to show anyone a copy, and Democrats have promised to propose amendments in protest, meaning the debate could get messy.Democrats and Republicans have competing objectives and several thorny questions to resolve, including how they should handle some senators' desire to hear from witnesses and collect new evidence, how much time to allow each side to make its case and when to allow senators to move to dismiss the charges.Either in that resolution or separately, the Senate must also send a summons notifying Mr. Trump of the impeachment articles and asking for his formal reply.Opening arguments by the House and White House could last for days.The House managers and White House defense lawyers will most likely have a few days to draw up motions and written legal briefs on their respective arguments to put before the Senate. This will be their first chance to make their cases to senators, and the public.Once all the briefs are in, likely sometime next week, the trial will begin in earnest. The House managers will most likely have a day or more to present the facts of the Ukraine case and their arguments for why Mr. Trump ought to be removed from office.Mr. Trump's defense lawyers will probably be given the same amount of time to present a defense. Because they chose not to mount a defense in the House in the run-up to Mr. Trump's impeachment, it will be the first time the president's team has explicitly responded to the House's allegations and its first opportunity to make a formal argument for why he should remain in office.Senators then have a couple days or so to question both sides. Though the questions are made in writing, the managers and lawyers respond out loud for the whole chamber to hear.The trial will eventually end, one way or another.What comes next is up to the Senate. If a majority of senators support calling witnesses, they could do so, extending the proceeding by weeks or more. In that scenario, a trial could last through the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses, and force Mr. Trump to deliver his State of the Union address, scheduled for Feb. 4, while he is on trial in the Senate. (Mr. Clinton did so in 1999.)During the trial, the case can be dismissed altogether by a majority vote. Doing so would certainly give Republican leaders the speedy outcome they want, but it may be hard to secure the 51 votes necessary to do. Republicans made it clear on Monday that they do not have the support of enough senators to move to a dismissal before the trial begins, as Mr. Trump has suggested he wants.More likely, senators will eventually vote on each of the two articles of impeachment. The Constitution stipulates that it takes two-thirds of the Senate, 67 lawmakers, to convict and remove the president from office. Anything short of that will result in acquittal, by far the most likely outcome.PhotographTop, Representative Adam B.

| Jump to first hitGatherings like the World Economic Forum give the president's adviser and daughter a chance to meet the world's power brokers, who have come to acknowledge her influence in the White House.DAVOS, Switzerland -- If the World Economic Forum gave President Trump a break from his political and legal troubles at home, for his eldest daughter it presented another opportunity to stride across the world stage.Ivanka Trump, a White House adviser, was presented at this conference of global elites as a principal second only to her father, even as she traveled as part of a delegation that included all of the president's most important economic advisers.She shared top billing with Mr. Trump Wednesday morning at a breakfast for corporate executives, including the chief executive of Apple, Tim Cook, which she co-hosted with the president and helped organize. There, she took precedence over four cabinet members and the president's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, who were also in attendance.She also organized Mr. Trump's dinner meeting Tuesday night with global chief executives, and participated in a bilateral meeting with the prime minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan. She sat for an interview with the Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, and she was the sole adviser Mr. Trump mentioned by name during his 30-minute speech on Tuesday.""Under Ivanka's leadership, our Pledge to America's Workers has become a full-blown national movement,"" Mr. Trump said, referring to an effort to get employers to expand worker retraining.It was a ringing endorsement in front of a moneyed crowd for a program -- a set of pledges that so far are more promised than realized -- that Ms. Trump has been championing for the past year in lower-profile appearances across the country. After a difficult first year in Washington, during which Ms. Trump struggled to find her lane, the challenges faced by the American worker have given her what she describes as a passion project.Davos was just the latest international gathering in which the president's daughter has taken a major role. And foreign government and business leaders who were once skeptical of her presence -- like her father, she had no background in government -- have recognized the amorphous power held by Mr. Trump's family-members-turned-official-advisers.Ms. Trump used a news conference at Davos about ""reskilling"" workers to promote what she called the president's ""freedom agenda,"" which she claimed was chipping away at income inequality and bringing more women into the labor force. Dressed in a pale blue fitted pantsuit that stood out in a sea of black, she kept to her studiously optimistic message, saying that 400 companies had signed a pledge to expand worker training programs as their industries evolve.""That's close to 15 million students and workers,"" she said. ""15 million lives impacted, 15 million families impacted.""In an interview, Ms. Trump said she planned to continue talking about work force development at home, as part of a campaign message that will help her father. She is seen by campaign officials as one of the top fund-raisers and surrogates for the re-election campaign, though she said, ""I've always bristled at the term surrogate,"" which she said suggests merely ""talking about things I haven't been involved in.""Her draw comes in large part because of her high name recognition across the United States, aides said, and her potential to sway the critical voting block of suburban women with a message about newly enacted benefits that she championed. In the White House, she pushed successfully for an expanded child tax credit -- though much of the benefit goes to well-to-do families -- and paid family leave for federal workers.""I do think we have a lot of wins on the board the American people don't know about,"" she said.Ms. Trump, however, views herself less as a political voice like her brother Donald Trump, Jr., and more as someone who can mobilize voters and help her father through a focus on two issues the Democrats claim as their own: women's empowerment and the American work force.Ms. Trump said she would ""continue to be focused on the areas where I've helped the president move the ball. I gave up my life to move to Washington to try to help Americans and I'm proud of what we've been able to accomplish.""Ms. Trump has become a fixture at major international gatherings since she raised hackles at her first one in 2017, when she briefly took her father's chair at a Group of 20 summit meeting in Hamburg, Germany.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan invited her to the Group of 20 meeting last July in Osaka, where she gave a keynote address on women's empowerment, and then delivered a video report on Mr. Trump's dealings with foreign leaders. A brief video from a private gathering, showing her awkward foray into a conversation with the leaders of France, Britain, Canada and the International Monetary Fund, quickly went viral and fed criticism that she was out of her depth.Later, she accompanied Mr. Trump as he crossed the Demilitarized Zone, stepping into North Korea and meeting Kim Jong-un, an experience she described at the time as ""surreal.""At the Doha Forum, a Middle East conference, Ms. Trump was interviewed onstage by the State Department spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, who came under criticism for asking her questions about her pet project on female entrepreneurship while ignoring the White House's Middle East policy.In Davos, Ms. Trump was careful not to pick a fight with one of the other most prominent female figures attending the World Economic Forum, the Swedish climate activist, Greta Thunberg. Her father implicitly criticized Ms. Thunberg, saying that climate activists, with their pessimistic messages, were the ""heirs of yesterday's foolish fortune tellers.""""I am fundamentally a believer in the power of optimism,"" Ms. Trump said in a phone interview, echoing one of her father's lines.But she added of the 17-year-old Ms. Thunberg, ""I'm not going to criticize anyone who's bringing their energy and voice. That's not my style. I think she's elevated awareness and that's a positive thing.""Early in the administration, it looked as if Ms. Trump was embracing at least some of Ms. Thunberg's urgency about climate change. During the presidential transition, she brought in former Vice President Al Gore to discuss the issue with Mr. Trump and sat down with Leonardo DiCaprio, who gave her a copy of his documentary, ""Before the Flood.""But after she and her husband, Jared Kushner, lost an internal debate about withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, she has gone quiet on the issue. In the interview, she placed the emphasis on finding solutions rather than raising alarms.""I believe in American innovation and global innovation,"" Ms. Trump said, adding that ""only a purely pessimistic outlook is not going to help us solve the problem.""With the Senate holding a trial on the impeachment of the president, Ms. Trump also expressed frustration about the political and legal quagmire that her father is set to return to in Washington.""Our actions over the last two weeks have stood in really stark relief against the priorities of others in Congress,"" she said. As for whether the Senate should subpoena witnesses, Ms. Trump remained vague. ""I have an opinion but it would be one voice in many,"" she said, ""so I've largely deferred to the legal team.""PhotographIvanka Trump, the president's eldest daughter and a White House adviser, arriving for a press conference in Davos on Wednesday.

| Jump to first hitIn their own words, here is how the House managers and President Trump's defense team view impeachment.WASHINGTON -- A former police chief, a prosecutor who won the conviction of an F.B.I. agent and one of Texas' first Latina representatives. A constitutional law professor who once defended O.J. Simpson against a murder charge, a former special prosecutor who pursued the impeachment of President Bill Clinton and a litigator for the Christian right.For the third time in American history, the Senate has convened as a court of impeachment to consider whether to remove a sitting president, and two teams of lawyers are facing off in a confrontation with heavy political and constitutional consequences.The seven House Democratic impeachment managers, handpicked by Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, have argued that President Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to help smear his political rivals and obstructed Congress to conceal his actions. Mr. Trump's defense team -- drawn from the White House counsel's office and outside lawyers, including a few who frequently appear on television -- has argued that the president did nothing wrong and accused Democrats of using impeachment as a tool to remove an opponent they could not defeat at the ballot box.Here is a look at the opposing legal teams and how they see impeachment, in their own words.The House Impeachment ManagersIn the prior two presidential impeachment trials, all 20 members of the House selected to prosecute the cases -- seven for Andrew Johnson in 1868 and 13 for Bill Clinton in 1999 -- were white men. But the group chosen by Ms. Pelosi includes two African-Americans, a Latina and three women.Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the lead impeachment manager, spoke for as long as the six other managers combined, according to C-SPAN. He spent hours building the House's case by laying out the central themes and then delivering impassioned closing statements that drew grudging praise even from Republicans who disagreed -- along with his share of criticism from those who said they were insulted by his sharp assertions.Representatives Jerrold Nadler of New York and Zoe Lofgren of California, both veterans of the Clinton impeachment, drew on historic precedents from the proceedings against him and Johnson. Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York recounted the July 25 phone call at the heart of the Democratic case and worked in at least one hip-hop reference -- a signature flourish -- telling senators after he made the case to subpoena Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff: ""And if you don't know, now you know."" (The line is from ""Juicy,"" a 1994 hit by the Notorious B.I.G.)Representatives Val B. Demings, Jason Crow and Sylvia R. Garcia, all comparatively newer lawmakers, often sought to connect the charges facing Mr. Trump to their own backgrounds. Ms. Demings drew from her experience as a police chief in Florida. Ms. Garcia recalled her time as a judge. And Mr. Crow reflected on his time as an Army Ranger dependent on military resources.Over the allotted three days of presentation -- and another day spent unsuccessfully pushing for subpoenas for additional documents and witnesses -- the seven lawmakers argued that Mr. Trump's pressure campaign against Ukraine warranted his removal from office, pointing to what they said was a dangerous pattern of putting his own interests above those of the country.The President's DefenseMr. Trump's defense team includes well-known veteran prosectors from the Clinton era, including Ken Starr, the independent counsel whose report led to the impeachment of Mr. Clinton, and Robert W. Ray, Mr. Starr's successor.Other members include fixtures on Fox News like Alan M. Dershowitz, the celebrity lawyer who defended Mr. Simpson, Claus von Bülow, Mike Tyson and Jeffrey Epstein, the financier who was accused of sex trafficking and killed himself last year in jail.Led by the president's personal lawyer Jay Sekulow and Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, the defense has argued that the House Democrats rushed through the process of impeachment in their zeal to overturn the results of an election they disagreed with, and that there was no evidence in the House case beyond hearsay that Mr. Trump had sought to tie the investigations to release of the security aid.Mr. Cipollone and Mr. Sekulow have been the president's most frequent defenders on the Senate floor, providing most of the arguments against the Democratic effort to vote on subpoenas for documents and witnesses ahead of the team arguments. The crux of their argument is that Mr. Trump is accused of no crime and thus cannot be impeached, a legal theory that is rejected by most constitutional scholars. They also argue that Democrats are seeking to remove the president for policy judgments with which they disagree, thus nullifying the will of voters nine months before the next election.In a remarkable twist, Mr. Starr, known for his aggressive pursuit of Mr. Clinton's impeachment for lying about an affair with a White House intern, told the Senate on Monday that the use of the constitutional remedy should be rare, and that Mr. Trump's actions did not rise to it.Other lawyers on the president's trial team include Pam Bondi, the former Florida attorney general; Eric D. Herschmann; Michael Purpura and Patrick Philbin, deputy White House counsels; and Jane Serene Raskin, who helped defend Mr. Trump during the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who investigated Russia's interference in the 2016 election and ties with the Trump campaign.On Monday, Mr. Dershowitz was the only one of the group to directly address the revelations by John R. Bolton in an unpublished manuscript that Mr. Trump directly tied aid to Ukraine aid to investigations of his political rivals. Even if true, Mr. Dershowitz said, it was not impeachable.Photograph(PHOTOGRAPHS BY ERIN SCHAFF) (A16-A17)Word count: 953Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hitThe president broadly asserted his authority of the criminal justice system, attacking law enforcement officials and issuing pardons.WASHINGTON -- President Trump and Attorney General William P. Barr agree on one thing at least: The president is making the attorney general's job much harder. What they don't agree on: Mr. Trump sees no reason to stop.Defying Mr. Barr's pleas, the president renewed his public attacks on law enforcement on Tuesday, denouncing the prosecutors, judge and jury forewoman in the case of his longtime friend Roger J. Stone Jr. and defending his convicted former adviser Michael T. Flynn against Mr. Trump's own Justice Department.Explicitly rebuffed, Mr. Barr was left by the end of the day to consider his own future. He expressed dissatisfaction to associates and his irritation soon fed news reports that he was considering resignation if the president continued to publicly weigh in on individual prosecutions of his own associates. But it was unclear whether that would persuade Mr. Trump to back off or only get his back up.The suggestions of resignation came at the end of a day when the president asserted his dominance over a justice system that had long sought to insulate itself from political pressures. Calling himself ""the chief law enforcement officer of the country,"" Mr. Trump demanded a new trial for Mr. Stone, urged federal judges to address the ""tremendous"" abuse of the special counsel investigation of his campaign and bypassed the traditional pardon process to grant clemency to celebrity convicts recommended by his friends, allies and political donors.Mr. Trump insisted he had not directly interfered in the prosecution of advisers like Mr. Stone and Mr. Flynn, but declared again that he had the power to if he wanted and at the very least, he planned to speak out for them. ""You take a look at what's happening to these people,"" he told reporters. ""Somebody has to stick up for the people.""In doing so, Mr. Trump acknowledged that Mr. Barr was right last week when he said that the president was making it ""impossible"" for him to do his work. ""I do make his job harder,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I do agree with that. I think that's true.""But while he praised Mr. Barr's ""incredible integrity"" and avowed ""total confidence"" in him, Mr. Trump dismissed the suggestion that he stop discussing individual cases. ""Social media for me has been very important because it gives me a voice, because I don't get that voice in the press,"" he said. ""In the media, I don't get that voice. So I'm allowed to have a voice.""Even as he refused to take Mr. Barr's advice, Mr. Trump expressed no anger toward his attorney general and some officials said he understood why Mr. Barr felt the need to complain last week to ABC News about the presidential tweets. But The Washington Post reported on Tuesday night that Mr. Barr was thinking about stepping down if the president's tweets continue, a story confirmed by an administration official and seemingly aimed at an audience of one.Mr. Barr was especially irritated by the president's tweet on Tuesday morning denigrating Judge Amy Berman Jackson shortly before she was to hold a conference call with lawyers in Mr. Stone's case. Mr. Trump insisted in his tweet that she order a new trial for Mr. Stone but the Justice Department then disclosed that it opposed just such a retrial, a position personally approved by Mr. Barr.The attorney general then had lunch with Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel and a longtime friend and colleague, in what officials said was a previously scheduled get-together. While Mr. Barr has been incredibly frustrated and has a limit to what he will put up with, people who know him said they doubted he would give in so quickly.An abrupt departure by Mr. Barr would roil a Justice Department on track to deliver several initiatives important to Mr. Trump, including an overhaul of the F.B.I., a criminal investigation into the origins of the Russia inquiry and a continuing leak investigation into James B. Comey, the former director of the F.B.I. It would also leave the president with a vacancy at the top of the Justice Department that might be hard to fill eight months before the election.Mr. Barr has taken heat from critics both inside and outside his department over what they see as the politicization of the law enforcement system. More than 1,100 former Justice Department officials called for Mr. Barr's resignation, and a group representing the nation's federal judges scheduled an emergency telephone conference to address the president's attacks on one of their own.The Justice Department dismissed suggestions on Tuesday night that Mr. Barr's departure was imminent. ""Addressing Beltway rumors: The Attorney General has no plans to resign,"" Kerri Kupec, the department spokeswoman, wrote on Twitter. Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, retweeted Ms. Kupec's message.The president told reporters on Tuesday that Mr. Stone, a longtime friend and off-and-on adviser, and Mr. Flynn, a campaign adviser before serving briefly as his national security adviser, were both ""treated very unfairly."" He called Mr. Stone's conviction ""a very, very rough thing"" and said that Mr. Flynn's ""life has been destroyed.""Mr. Stone, who was convicted in November of seven felonies for obstructing a congressional inquiry into the Trump campaign's ties to WikiLeaks, which disseminated Democratic emails stolen by Russian agents, is scheduled to be sentenced on Thursday. Mr. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his dealings with Russian officials but wants to withdraw his plea.Asked whether he was considering pardons for Mr. Stone, Mr. Flynn or Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman convicted on tax and other financial fraud charges, Mr. Trump said, ""I'm not even thinking about that."" But aides said he had broached the idea and critics said Tuesday's pardons and commutations for convicted political figures like Rod R. Blagojevich and Bernard B. Kerik sent a clear message to the president's associates that he may yet clear them.""The real test will be, what does this president do with Stone, Manafort and others who are directly connected to him and who have the ability to provide information that is harmful to him?"" said Eric H. Holder Jr., who served as attorney general under President Barack Obama.On Twitter, Mr. Trump cited a ""Fox & Friends"" legal analyst, Andrew Napolitano, who has insisted that the president ""has every right"" to intervene in a criminal case. He quoted Mr. Napolitano's calls for Judge Jackson to reconsider Mr. Stone's case.""Judge Jackson now has a request for a new trial based on the unambiguous & self outed bias of the foreperson,"" Mr. Trump tweeted, quoting Mr. Napolitano.Judge Jackson ruled Tuesday morning that Mr. Stone's sentencing would go forward as planned on Thursday despite last-ditch motions by his defense lawyers. She said she would allow the defense to file an amended motion for a new trial, give the government a chance to respond with its own filing and schedule a hearing if warranted. Defense lawyers argue that juror misconduct led to an unfair trial.The handling of Mr. Stone's case has generated tumult throughout the Justice Department and grabbed the attention of Washington's broader legal establishment. After Mr. Barr scrapped the original sentencing recommendation in favor of a lighter one, the four career prosecutors handling the matter withdrew from the case and one resigned from the department entirely.As the president has repeatedly pointed out, two of the four prosecutors had worked for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, whose investigation of Russia's interference in the 2016 election dogged Mr. Trump for two years. The president attacked Mr. Mueller's team anew on Tuesday, saying if he were not president, he would sue it.The president said he had not intervened in Mr. Stone's case, evidently making a distinction between his public commentaries and explicit orders, but added that he had the power to do so if he wanted. ""Just so you understand, I chose not to be involved,"" he said. ""I'm allowed to be totally involved. I'm actually, I guess, the chief law enforcement officer of the country.""Republican congressional leaders defended Mr. Barr. ""Suggestions from outside groups that the attorney general has fallen short of the responsibilities of his office are unfounded,"" Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California said in a joint statement.Mr. Trump's attacks on Judge Jackson generated alarms in the judiciary. The Federal Judges Association, a voluntary organization, scheduled an emergency telephone conference for this week. Judge Cynthia M. Rufe of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania told USA Today that the group wanted to discuss ""plenty of issues that we are concerned about.""Mr. Trump countered that the judges should instead investigate misconduct in the Mueller investigation. ""I hope the Federal Judges Association will discuss the tremendous FISA Court abuse that has taken place with respect to the Mueller Investigation Scam, including the forging of documents and knowingly using the fake and totally discredited Dossier before the Court,"" he wrote on Twitter.The role of Mr. Trump's lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani in another politically fraught matter before the Justice Department has also come under scrutiny.Mr. Barr said last week that the department had an ""intake process"" for information from Ukraine, prompting complaints that law enforcement officials were giving Mr. Giuliani special treatment because he has said he turned over evidence against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, Hunter Biden, about their dealings in Ukraine.Mr. Giuliani led the campaign to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into Mr. Biden and other Democrats, a campaign that ultimately led the House to impeach Mr. Trump for abuse of power; he was acquitted this month in a Senate trial.The department routes all Ukraine matters through a central process, not to circumvent channels but to avoid duplicating efforts, Stephen E. Boyd, an assistant attorney general, clarified on Tuesday. The United States attorney in Brooklyn, Richard P. Donoghue, oversees the process, and his counterpart in Pittsburgh, Scott W. Brady, accepts any unsolicited information from the public, including from Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Boyd wrote in a letter to Congress.Michael D. Shear contributed reporting from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.Katie Benner and Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.PhotographThe president agrees he makes the attorney general's job hard.

| Jump to first hitSenator Mitt Romney grew emotional as he pronounced the president ""guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust."" The recriminations from fellow Republicans were immediate.WASHINGTON -- Senator Mitt Romney of Utah never became president, but he earned a new distinction on Wednesday: He will be remembered as the first senator in American history to vote to remove a president of his own party from office.Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee for president, said he expected swift and extreme recrimination from his party for his solitary act of defiance. He was not incorrect.Donald Trump Jr., the president's oldest son, tweeted that Mr. Romney ""is forever bitter"" about losing the presidency and called for him to be ""expelled"" from the Republican Party. Ronna McDaniel, Mr. Romney's niece and the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, said that the president had done nothing wrong, the party was ""more united than ever behind him"" -- and that this was not the first time she had disagreed with ""Mitt."" And President Trump himself tweeted a video attacking Mr. Romney as a ""Democrat secret asset.""Shortly after 4 p.m. on Wednesday, Mr. Romney voted to convict Mr. Trump of abuse of power for his pressure campaign on Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.""Attempting to corrupt an election to maintain power is about as egregious an assault on the Constitution as can be made,"" Mr. Romney said in an interview in his Senate office on Wednesday morning, ahead of the vote and an afternoon floor speech in which he choked up as he explained his decision.He declared Mr. Trump ""guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.""Mr. Romney did vote with his party against the second article of impeachment, obstruction of Congress, arguing that House Democrats had failed to exhaust their legal options for securing testimony and other evidence they had sought.Although the final result of the Senate vote had never been in question, the defection of Mr. Romney was a rare cliffhanger in the impeachment proceedings and also a kind of moral sideshow.His vote cast into relief the rapid evolution of the Republican Party into an entity that has wholly succumbed to the vise grip of Mr. Trump. It deprives the president of the monolithic Republican support he had craved at the end of an impeachment case that he has been eager to dismiss as a partisan ""hoax"" perpetrated by Democrats.On the Senate floor on Wednesday, Mr. Romney placed his decision in the context of his faith, his family and how history would remember it.""I will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial,"" Mr. Romney said. ""They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong, grievously wrong.""In the interview earlier, Mr. Romney, who has been critical of Mr. Trump at various points since 2016, said he was acutely aware that he would suffer serious political ramifications for his decision, particularly in light of the strict loyalty the president has come to expect from elected officials of his own party. No House Republican voted to impeach Mr. Trump in December. (Representative Justin Amash, an independent from Michigan, fled the Republican Party last year over his differences with Mr. Trump and voted in favor of both articles.)""I recognize there is going to be enormous consequences for having reached this conclusion,"" Mr. Romney said. ""Unimaginable"" is how he described what might be in store for him.Mr. Romney had served as governor of Massachusetts before his unsuccessful run against President Barack Obama in 2012. He then moved to Utah and eventually ran for the Senate. He said he had come under enormous pressure in recent weeks from rank-and-file members of a party whose support for Mr. Trump has become nearly unanimous.""I don't want to be the skunk at the garden party, and I don't want the disdain of Republicans across the country,"" Mr. Romney said in the interview.He already has endured a great deal of it, namely from Mr. Trump himself, who recently derided Mr. Romney as ""a pompous ass."" At a grocery store in Florida last weekend, after Mr. Romney voted in favor of calling witnesses to testify in the Senate trial -- another break with Republicans -- he said a man called him a ""traitor,"" while another shouted, ""Stick with the team!""As of late Wednesday morning, Mr. Romney said he had not yet informed Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, of how he would vote. He added that he made his final decision late last week, after the final round of questions between the senators and the respective sides in the impeachment trial. The magnitude of the matter weighed heavily on him.""There's not been a morning that I've gotten up after 4 a.m., just obviously thinking about how important this is, what the consequence is,"" Mr. Romney said.Looking back over his political career, Mr. Romney recalled times in which his decisions had been influenced ""in some cases by political benefit.""""And I regret that,"" he added, without specifying the particular decisions. He became increasingly reflective as the interview wore on.""I have found, in business in particular but also in politics, that when something is in your personal best interests, the ability of the mind to rationalize that that's the right thing is really quite extraordinary,"" Mr. Romney said. ""I have seen it in others, and I have seen it in myself.""As Mr. Romney revealed on the Senate floor how he would cast his votes, Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, dabbed at his eyes.""I had an instinct,"" he said afterward, ""that this might be a moment.""""He's been grappling with it,"" added Senator Mike Braun, Republican of Indiana, who sits next to Mr. Romney on the Senate floor. He said he respected Mr. Romney's decision.In his remarks, Mr. Romney called the actions in Ukraine of Mr. Biden's son, Hunter Biden, ""unsavory but also not a crime."" (Hunter Biden held a seat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company at a time when his father was vice president and handling diplomacy with the country.) Mr. Romney added that Mr. Trump's lawyers provided no evidence that a crime was committed by either of the Bidens.""The president's insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit,"" Mr. Romney said. ""There's no question in my mind that were their names not Biden, the president would never have done what he did.""As the vote arrived, Mr. Romney sat staring straight ahead, talking to no one, his hands clasped in his lap. When he stood up and declared ""guilty,"" he did so quickly and sat right back down.Moments after the court was adjourned and senators stood up, Mr. Romney shook hands with Mr. Braun, smiled and rushed to the door just feet from his back-row desk, becoming the first senator to leave the chamber.When asked Wednesday morning if he had any special flourishes planned for his speech, Mr. Romney just shrugged. ""I'm planning on tearing it up when I'm finished,"" he quipped, a reference to Speaker Nancy Pelosi's response to the president's State of the Union address Tuesday night.Emily Cochrane and Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.Photograph""I recognize there is going to be enormous consequences for having reached this conclusion,"" Senator Mitt Romney said of his vote to convict President Trump on one of two articles of impeachment.

| Jump to first hitAs President Trump appears at daily briefings, the Democratic front-runner faces the challenge of raising his profile in a presidential race that has moved almost entirely into the digital realm.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the likely Democratic nominee against President Trump in this year's general election, was asked a question during a virtual fund-raiser on Sunday that reflected a challenge looming over his campaign as the coronavirus outbreak intensifies.""What I'm concerned about is that we see Donald Trump every day with this crisis giving his press report,"" said one donor, according to a pool report from the fund-raiser, which was conducted by telephone. ""And I would just love to see you more. Like, how do we get more of you and less of him on our airwaves?""Mr. Biden has been taunted by online critics over his relatively low profile since the coronavirus forced him off the campaign trail, with Trump campaign officials and others needling him with the hashtag #WhereIsJoe. The former vice president has not made an appearance on camera in front of the public since he gave a brief live-streamed address from his home on Tuesday, when primaries were held in Florida, Illinois and Arizona.At Sunday's fund-raiser, Mr. Biden said that a recreation room in his home in Delaware had been turned into a television studio, and that he planned to give remarks on Monday. On a conference call with reporters on Friday, Mr. Biden said his campaign was working to increase his ability to speak to the public.""I want to be in daily or at least, you know, significant contact with the American people and communicate what I would be doing, what I think we should be doing and how we should be doing it,"" Mr. Biden said.Mr. Biden's campaign got off to a rocky start with its efforts at virtual campaigning, as a ""virtual town hall"" with Illinois voters this month was marred by technical problems.At Sunday's virtual fund-raiser, Mr. Biden addressed speculation about whether Mr. Trump would try to postpone the general election because of the coronavirus. (The president does not have that authority.)""The idea of postponing the electoral process is just, seems to me, out of the question,"" Mr. Biden said. ""I know there's a lot of rumors and speculation as to, 'Is the other guy going to try to postpone the election in November?' and all that. There's no need to do that.""Mr. Biden also indicated that he was giving serious thought to his potential future running mate, saying that he must ""start that vetting process relatively soon, meaning in a matter of weeks.""""There will be a group that is in excess of six or seven people that I look at, because those background checks matter,"" said Mr. Biden, who has gone through the process himself. He expressed hope that ""once I pick someone, God willing if I'm the nominee, that there's not going to be any snafu.""Mr. Biden's remaining opponent in the primary race, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, has also shifted to campaigning virtually. Mr. Sanders held a live-streamed event on the coronavirus from Burlington, Vt., on Sunday, one of several such events he has done in recent days.Since in-person campaigning came to a halt, Mr. Biden and his team have weighed in repeatedly about the coronavirus, sharply criticizing Mr. Trump's handling of the crisis. But he has struggled to break through given the flood of news about the outbreak, and he lacks the kind of platform that is available to Mr. Trump, who has appeared daily at White House briefings on the virus.Mr. Biden gave a speech about the coronavirus this month and released a plan for responding to the outbreak, and on Friday's conference call with reporters, he urged the president to ""stop saying false things."" But in the past week, he has been largely out of sight even as his campaign presses its case against Mr. Trump over his handling of the crisis.Mr. Biden's team has issued a number of written statements and has posted repeatedly on social media about the subject. His campaign released a video in which Ronald Klain, a former chief of staff to Mr. Biden who served as the Ebola response coordinator in the Obama White House, stands in front of a white board and discusses Mr. Trump's handling of the virus and how Mr. Biden would respond. The video has now been seen four million times on Twitter.Another video from the Biden campaign alternates between playing footage of Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden speaking about the coronavirus. ""This moment calls for a president,"" the video says at the end. ""In November, you can elect one.""A spokesman for the Trump campaign, Matt Wolking, on Sunday accused Mr. Biden of seeking to use the coronavirus for ""political gain at the exact moment the country needs optimism and unity.""""It's also cowardly -- because instead of showing his own face, Biden is having his advisers and allies do most of his dirty work for him,"" he said.Sydney Ember and Katie Glueck contributed reporting.PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Wilmington, Del., this month. The coronavirus outbreak has forced him, Senator Bernie Sanders and President Trump to cancel in-person events in the presidential race.

| Jump to first hitBut the few times the president did anything in public on Thursday, it was clear he was unnerved by the prospect of a Senate trial.WASHINGTON -- Shortly after 2 p.m. on Thursday, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa administered the oath to Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. in the well of the Senate, asking him to swear ""that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John Trump, president of the United States,"" he would deliver impartial justice.At the White House at that precise moment, President Trump was scheduled to be hosting an event promoting the administration's attempt to empower religious students to exercise their rights to pray at school. But for the next hour as, one by one, 99 senators signed the oath book, the president kept the students waiting. Finally, he allowed reporters into the Oval Office, where he sat behind the Resolute Desk and took their questions.The day before, Mr. Trump had presided over a celebration of a trade deal with China, calling out some of the nation's biggest corporate leaders as if they were his golf buddies. Earlier Thursday, the Senate had given final approval to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Now he had to talk about the attempt to remove him from office.""I did the biggest deal ever done in the history of our country yesterday in terms of trade,"" he said, referring to (and exaggerating the size of) the China deal, ""and that was the second story to a total hoax. Today, we just had passed the U.S.M.C.A. It's going to take the place of NAFTA, which was a terrible deal, and the U.S.M.C.A. will probably be second to this witch hunt hoax, which hopefully everyone knows is not going anywhere.""The president claimed that he did not know Lev Parnas, an associate of his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani who said in interviews this week that the president knew everything about the effort to push Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, as well as the 2016 election, the reason for his impeachment.He described Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the Intelligence Committee chairman who had read the articles of impeachment to the assembled Senate, as ""a corrupt person. He's a corrupt politician.""He said the entire impeachment inquiry was ""a hoax,"" adding, ""Everybody knows that.""Referring to a July phone call he had with the president of Ukraine that helped touch off the impeachment inquiry, he said Democrats ""picked up a phone call that was perfect, but they didn't know it was perfect.""And then, minutes after dismissing the reporters from the Oval Office, Mr. Trump issued the Twitter version of a shout.""I JUST GOT IMPEACHED FOR MAKING A PERFECT PHONE CALL!"" he wrote.The all-caps tweet only underscored how Mr. Trump has become increasingly unnerved by the prospect of a Senate trial, even one in which his Republican allies are widely expected to acquit him. And by the few times the president did anything in public on Thursday, it was clear he was looking for ways to do something about it.On Twitter, he gave an unusual plug to Senator Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican who is retiring at the end of the year and has said he may vote to hear from more witnesses during the Senate impeachment trial.Mr. Trump appeared to offer his conditional support for a bill introduced by Mr. Alexander that would award the Congressional Gold Medal to a Tennessee native, Master Sgt. Roddie Edmonds, an American prisoner of war who helped save Jewish lives during World War II. ""Looking at this strongly!"" the president tweeted.Democrats need four Republican votes to force the Senate to subpoena witnesses like John R. Bolton, the former White House national security adviser, to testify, and Mr. Alexander is one of four who have signaled a potential openness to breaking ranks.The president's school prayer event appeared to be a direct appeal to the evangelical Christians who are an important part of his political base.There was very little new to announce, and the American Civil Liberties Union called the guidance issued Thursday a ""copycat document"" almost identical to one released by the George W. Bush administration in 2003, which reinforces existing legal parameters for schools that receive federal funding to allow students to pray individually and in groups. But Mr. Trump framed the new guidelines as a landmark, saying that there was a ""growing totalitarian impulse on the far left that seeks to punish, restrict and even prohibit religious expression"" and said that the new guidance ensures the ""right to pray.""The president capped his day with a meeting with several campaign aides, where he grilled them on how voters were receiving impeachment.In his conversations with advisers on Thursday, Mr. Trump repeated once again that he could not believe he was facing such a predicament as impeachment. He said he wanted people to be prepared for a motion to dismiss and has hoped for one, even though Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has said the Senate will have to take up the matter.At different times, Mr. Trump has also told aides he wants the opportunity to call witnesses he believes could help him politically, like Hunter Biden, Mr. Biden's son, as well as the whistle-blower, a C.I.A. officer who first alerted the Intelligence Committee to Mr. Trump's pressure campaign on the Ukrainian government.Mr. Trump, always concerned about optics and how things play, has also expressed reservations about whether his lawyers will be aggressive enough during the televised Senate trial.Mr. McConnell has advised the president that the best trial is a short one and that witnesses can only create more unknowns.On a conference call with reporters on Wednesday, senior Trump officials said it would be extraordinarily unlikely for a trial to take longer than a few weeks, calling theirs an easy case, even as new details about Mr. Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine have continued to come out.In a meeting with conservative leaders at the White House the same day, two officials who have become the public face of the White House impeachment response, Tony Sayegh and Pam Bondi, said much the same thing.Mr. Trump's re-election campaign, meanwhile, used the events of the day as a fund-raising opportunity, directing voters through targeted digital ads to an ""official impeachment defense fund,"" which acted as a portal to the campaign's website.The message delivered from Mr. Trump online was simple: ""FIGHT BACK.""Annie Karni reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.Annie Karni reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.PhotographPresident Trump's Twitter feed showed that he was paying close attention to his political future.

| Jump to first hitAt lunch with TV anchors before the State of the Union, the president was jovial about Iowa's voting problems and said John Bolton 'turned on me.'President Trump told a group of television news anchors at the White House on Tuesday that he would participate in this year's general election debates, despite his misgivings about the commission that oversees them, according to two people with knowledge of his comments.Mr. Trump also said he hoped that Rush Limbaugh, the right-wing talk radio star who this week announced a diagnosis of advanced lung cancer, would attend Tuesday's State of the Union address. The president said he was interested in awarding Mr. Limbaugh the Presidential Medal of Freedom. On Tuesday evening during his address, Mr. Trump did just that, with the first lady, Melania Trump, presenting the medal to a surprised Mr. Limbaugh in the gallery.In a jovial mood after Iowa Democrats botched Monday's caucus vote count -- a situation that Mr. Trump happily called a ""fiasco"" -- the president held court for nearly two hours on Tuesday afternoon over a lunch of sole and soup in the State Dining Room. Vice President Mike Pence and Ivanka Trump also attended.The conversation, an annual tradition for anchors, is off the record, but as in past years, multiple people described Mr. Trump's remarks after the fact. Journalists from The New York Times were not invited and did not agree to those off-the-record terms.The White House declined to discuss the president's remarks. ""I actually have ethics so I'm not going to comment on an off-the-record lunch,"" said Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary.The president had tough words for John Bolton, his former national security adviser, complaining that Mr. Bolton wanted to be referred to as ""ambassador"" and saying that Mr. Bolton ""turned on me"" by writing a book that includes unflattering portrayals of Mr. Trump's behavior.As for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who will stand on the dais beside Mr. Pence during the State of the Union, Mr. Trump said the two had not spoken in some time. ""There's one person behind me who's going to be friendly and one who's not going to be friendly,"" the president said, referring to his Tuesday evening address.With a Diet Coke at his side, Mr. Trump spoke of his regret about Mr. Limbaugh's medical diagnosis, saying that he had recently spoken with the talk-radio host and Mr. Limbaugh had offered no hint of his illness.Asked about this fall's general election debates, Mr. Trump repeated his recent complaints that ""Never Trumpers"" sit on the Commission on Presidential Debates, the nonpartisan group that organizes the events. But the president said he had decided to participate, because he believed his debate performances helped him win support from voters in the 2016 campaign.The annual anchor lunch predates Mr. Trump's administration. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump broke from precedent by declining to invite journalists from CNN, a network that he routinely accuses of bias.Chuck Todd, the moderator of NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" told Mr. Trump at the lunch that he was asking a question on behalf of the CNN anchor Jake Tapper, according to another person familiar with the exchange. The president responded by saying that journalists from ""MSDNC"" -- his recently adopted nickname for MSNBC -- were also absent, though Mr. Todd hosts a daily afternoon show for the cable network.Mr. Trump often castigates news outlets and individual reporters in public, contributing to a hostile environment toward journalists that press freedom groups have called dangerous and encouraging to autocrats who suppress independent media. But the president was described as cordial and easygoing at Tuesday's event.PhotographPresident Trump is said to be considering awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Rush Limbaugh.

| Jump to first hitWith impeachment behind them, House Democrats must determine how to balance their policy agenda with a determination to continue investigating President Trump.WASHINGTON -- House Democrats, back on their heels after President Trump's acquittal of impeachment charges, wrestled on Thursday with a question that could determine their party's fate in November: Now what?As Mr. Trump took an ostentatious victory lap at the White House, Democrats were grappling with how to balance their policy agenda and their determination to continue aggressive investigations of a president they view as a threat to the country.With just five months left in the legislative year and nine before the elections, Democrats concede they have to make some tough decisions.""It's something we need to talk about,"" said Representative John Yarmuth, Democrat of Kentucky and the chairman of the House Budget Committee. He said that the issue came up during the weekly closed-door meeting of committee leaders.Democrats believe they won back the House majority in 2018 with a laser focus on health care and the economy. But they are also revolted by an unrepentant president and reluctant to abandon investigations into his conduct that might yield evidence of wrongdoing. With Mr. Trump emboldened by his acquittal, some say investigating him is more important than ever.Speaker Nancy Pelosi seemed ready to make a pivot on Thursday, less than 24 hours after the Senate verdict that he was not guilty ended a five-month impeachment drama that consumed the Capitol.At her weekly news conference, Ms. Pelosi spent the bulk of her opening remarks talking about Mr. Trump's State of the Union address -- ""appalling,"" she said -- and pushing back on his claims that he is responsible for the nation's economic turnaround.But she also vowed not to let up on oversight of his policies and personal conduct.""We will continue to do our oversight to protect and defend the Constitution,"" Ms. Pelosi said.Putting that into practice may prove fraught. Democratic leaders must decide in the coming days whether to carry on with the investigation into Mr. Trump's effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, which led the House to impeach the president on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.The biggest question at the moment is whether to issue a subpoena for John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, after senators refused to consider new testimony in the impeachment trial. Doing so could yield damaging new information, but it also risks making Democrats look like sore losers.On Wednesday, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the Judiciary Committee chairman and an impeachment manager, said that the House should subpoena Mr. Bolton, who has written a tell-all book that contains a direct account of Mr. Trump's decision to leverage nearly $400 million in military aid for Ukraine in exchange for the investigations.But Democrats also recognize that Mr. Bolton may be less receptive to speaking to the House now that Mr. Trump has been acquitted. On Thursday, Neither Ms. Pelosi nor Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the House Intelligence Committee chairman and the leader of the impeachment prosecution team, would say what they intend to do.""We really haven't made any decisions yet,"" Mr. Schiff said.Some of the Democrats' long-running investigations into Mr. Trump are continuing quietly, and others are proceeding in the federal courts, where the House is party to a handful of consequential legal fights over access to Mr. Trump's tax returns, other financial information and witness testimony and documents related to Robert S. Mueller III's Russia investigation.Several of the fights could go to the Supreme Court and perhaps be decided before November's elections. If Democrats were to win access, say, to Mr. Trump's federal tax returns, or a court forced Donald F. McGahn II, the former White House counsel, to testify about Mr. Trump's attempts to thwart the Russia investigation, it could produce a new round of high-profile hearings about whether the president had broken the law -- an inquiry that would surely reverberate in the presidential campaign.Lower-profile work by the House Oversight and Reform, Judiciary and Foreign Affairs committees has scrutinized the Trump administration's border policies, the decision to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census, politicization of the State Department and the responses to devastating hurricanes in the Caribbean.But the question is one of emphasis, and how Democrats answer it could shape voters' views of them heading into the next election. Representative Donna Shalala, Democrat of Florida, who served as health secretary to President Bill Clinton, repeated a single phrase when asked what Democrats should do next.""Health care, health care, health care,"" said Ms. Shalala, who is working on legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs and to end surprise medical billing.As is the case with most intraparty Democratic debates, moderates and progressives fall into different camps. Moderates want to talk to voters about ""kitchen table"" issues. Progressives want to send the message that the House will continue to act as a check on a president clearly emboldened by his acquittal.""People in Wisconsin, people in Michigan, people in Ohio, people in Pennsylvania, people in North Carolina, they're going to vote for their member of Congress or a president based on what that party is focused on,"" said Representative Tim Ryan, a centrist Democrat from Ohio. ""They are focused on their own economic situation. They will punish a party that is not focused on those issues.""But progressives like Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Jamie Raskin of Maryland said that Democrats should redouble their efforts to rein in Mr. Trump.""We must make sure that this administration does not continue to break the law,"" Ms. Omar said.Mr. Raskin framed it this way: ""We have the exact same oversight duties and powers as we did before. He also has not won himself the right to commit high crimes and misdemeanors against the Constitution and the people.""Even so, there were signs on Thursday that the House's marquee inquiries will shift into a lower gear. Norman L. Eisen and Barry H. Berke, who served as special counsels to the Judiciary Committee for its long-running abuse of power investigation and then formed part of its core impeachment team, are both expected to depart in the coming weeks.The internal discussion over next steps comes as the relationship between Mr. Trump and Ms. Pelosi has hit a new low, raising questions about whether it is even possible for them to work together on legislative matters. Both the president and the speaker have said that they want legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs and to fix the nation's crumbling infrastructure.But if the events of Thursday were any guide, they can barely stand to be in the same room with one another. At a White House celebration of his acquittal, Mr. Trump boasted about having taken a shot at Ms. Pelosi during the National Prayer Breakfast earlier that day.""I had Nancy Pelosi sitting four seats away, and I said things that a lot of people wouldn't have said,"" Mr. Trump said. ""But I meant every one of them.""At the Capitol, Ms. Pelosi shot back, saying Mr. Trump looked ""a little sedated"" at the State of the Union. ""That was not a State of the Union,"" she said. ""That was his state of his mind.""As Democrats contemplated the road ahead, Republicans were giddy, portraying the House's failed impeachment case as a misguided overreach.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, called impeachment ""a colossal political mistake."" Americans, he said, ""are more likely to focus at this point and for the rest of the year on, what kind of shape is the country in? How are you feeling about things? Are you better off now than you were four years ago?""PhotographSpeaker Nancy Pelosi spent the bulk of her opening remarks at her weekly press conference talking about President Trump's State of the Union address.

| Jump to first hitRepresentative Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, has made his mark during impeachment by stoking the anger of liberals while keeping the president happy.WASHINGTON -- Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican leader, hails from an era -- four years ago -- when gaffes could cost a lawmaker a job. In 2015 he lost his shot at the speaker's gavel after he said the quiet part out loud: The true purpose of Republicans' two-year inquiry into a deadly 2012 attack on the diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, was to dent Hillary Clinton's poll numbers.But in these times, when such impolitic truths are uttered often by the commander in chief, Mr. McCarthy has found a moment. He stayed on as the House Republicans' No. 2 after failing to grab the speakership, rising to the conference's top spot last year after Paul D. Ryan retired amid the anti-Trump wave of 2018, which handed the speaker's gavel to Nancy Pelosi.Unburdened by Mr. Ryan's strong ideologies or the self-certainty of a Newt Gingrich, Mr. McCarthy has become the happy warrior of the age, one colleague said, posing for photographs with players in the Ukraine saga, like Lev Parnas, shouting encouragement to his compatriots from his leadership perch and shepherding a fractious Republican conference behind President Trump, wrecker of Republican tradition.""Congress no longer operates as an independent branch of government, but as an appendage of the executive branch,"" said Tom Davis, a former Republican House member from Virginia. ""He is made for that role.""In recent weeks, Mr. McCarthy has called House impeachment ""a national nightmare,"" ""rigged"" and a ""last attempt to stop the Trump presidency."" He claimed the F.B.I. ""broke into"" Mr. Trump's campaign in a ""modern-day Watergate."" He suggested that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. should suspend campaigning while many of his top rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, sit as captive jurors in the impeachment trial.His delivery lacks the razor edge of his fellow House Republican leader Liz Cheney, who announced on Thursday that she would forgo a campaign for Wyoming's open Senate seat to remain in the House, a veiled threat to challenge Mr. McCarthy for the speakership if Republicans regain the majority. He never attains the volume of Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, who has challenged him for Republican leadership posts, or the umbrage of Representative Devin Nunes, a Republican from the California district next door.""He's a nice guy,"" said Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, with a verbal shrug.Five minutes later, Mr. Massie texted an additional thought: ""I can say this about Kevin, he's been far more helpful to the president than Paul Ryan would have ever been during this impeachment sham.""For now, that may be his main job: making the president happy.""Where is Kevin McCarthy, the great Kevin McCarthy?"" Mr. Trump demanded last week at a China trade event at the White House. When it was clear the minority leader was in the House, preparing for the vote to send articles of impeachment to the Senate, the president added: ""Kevin McCarthy, as you know, left for the hoax. Well, we have to do that; otherwise, it becomes a more serious hoax.""It is no small thing to the president that Mr. McCarthy kept House Republicans unified in their opposition to Mr. Trump's impeachment. House Republicans include ""former prosecutors who probably don't love the president, moderates who are retiring and thinking, 'I'm going to vote to impeach the president because I want my grandchildren to talk to me again,""' said John Feehery, a Republican strategist. ""That they didn't is a significant victory for the president, and a significant victory for Kevin McCarthy.""Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, said House Republicans had gained confidence in their leader since he flubbed the speakership and forced leaders to dragoon Mr. Ryan into action.""I can't see him making that Hillary Clinton mistake again,"" Mr. King said. ""He's able to get his point across without damaging the party.""""It's really brutal warfare right now, and any sign of seeming too reasonable or conciliatory could scare off the Republican base and be looked upon as weakness by the Democrats,"" he continued. ""These aren't normal times. Today, if you make a deal you're a sellout.""Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, noted, ""We need to have a productive relationship with the president.""The impeachment saga has, however, most likely tainted Mr. McCarthy. Late last year, his awkward defense of the president in the Ukraine affair on ""60 Minutes"" -- he appeared unfamiliar with the rough transcript of Mr. Trump's now-infamous call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine -- prompted Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, who left the Republican Party last year over the president's conduct, to tweet, ""Kevin McCarthy again displays his unique brand of incompetence and dishonesty.""Photographs have trickled out in recent days showing the minority leader hobnobbing with characters central to Mr. Trump's effort to enlist Ukraine in discrediting Mr. Biden. Those include Mr. Parnas, an associate of the president's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, and Robert F. Hyde, a Republican congressional candidate who suggested in encrypted messages to Mr. Parnas that he was secretly tracking the United States ambassador to Ukraine at the time, Marie L. Yovanovitch.Ms. Pelosi could not resist taking a dig at Mr. McCarthy on the House floor last week when she referred to ""new evidence, pursuant to a House subpoena, from Lev Parnas -- recently photographed with the Republican leader.""On Thursday, Mr. McCarthy could not hide his frustration with a reporter, Adam Klasfeld of Courthouse News, when he asked the leader to explain exactly what he had done with Mr. Parnas's campaign contributions, a question Mr. McCarthy said the reporter asks ""every week.""""I do events every single day, and I do pictures with thousands of people all the time,"" he said during one of his exchanges with Mr. Klasfeld, adding that he donated Mr. Parnas's contributions ""to charity."" He has repeatedly declined to say which ones.Asked whether Mr. McCarthy would agree to be interviewed for this article, his spokesman, Matt Sparks, said, ""I'm trying to figure out what he could say that might be interesting.""That was a question on the mind of some of his political opponents. After Mr. McCarthy suggested that the impeachment trial was a way for establishment Democrats to hurt Mr. Sanders's presidential campaign, Ms. Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, wrote on Twitter, ""As usual, the Minority Leader has no idea what he's talking about.""Charlie Dent, a former Republican House member from Pennsylvania, suggested the unsolicited advice to the Democrats was a way to damage Mr. Biden. ""This is Kevin McCarthy's way of invading the Democratic primary, and helping the president,"" he said. ""That's why he's wandered into this minefield.""Beneath the bravado, Mr. McCarthy may be feeling the walls closing in on him. After Republicans' 2018 midterm shellacking, he is one of only a half-dozen Republicans left in California's 53-member House delegation. There were 19 elected in 2006, when he first won his seat.He must protect his right flank from a restive Freedom Caucus, which counts as one of its founders Mr. Jordan, a ferocious Trump acolyte who helped derail Mr. McCarthy's bid for the speakership in 2015. Last week, the minority leader's confines grew even cozier with Ms. Cheney's political decision.All this, plus Mr. McCarthy must retain favor with the mercurial Mr. Trump, who makes his displeasure with recalcitrant Republican lawmakers known in ways that have cost them their jobs.The son of a firefighter, Mr. McCarthy, 54, hails from a solidly Republican, middle-class district in California's agricultural interior. He was initially skeptical of Mr. Trump: He once suggested that the president-to-be was on the payroll of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.But as Mr. Trump tightened his grip on the party's base, Mr. McCarthy wooed him with gestures large and small. During the 2016 campaign, he played mediator with outraged Republicans after Mr. Trump was heard bragging about sexual assault on an ""Access Hollywood"" tape. He issued a statement heralding ""a new period in our country's great history"" after Mr. Trump's ""American carnage"" inauguration speech. He threw a big party at the Trump International Hotel (Mr. Trump did not show up, despite high hopes) and he sent a handpicked supply of Mr. Trump's favorite cherry and strawberry Starburst candies to the White House.In 2010, Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Ryan and Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia were hailed as the young, hip, fit future of their party. In their book, ""Young Guns: A New Generation of Conservative Leaders,"" they portrayed themselves as ""reform-minded Republicans"" who were ""eager to erase the image of congressional Republicans as big spenders preoccupied with assuring their own re-election.""Today, Mr. Cantor and Mr. Ryan are gone, along with many of their small-government, free-market, pro-trade ideals, replaced by Mr. Trump's crackdown on immigrants, his protectionist tariffs, and tax cut and spending deals that have ballooned the federal deficit. Used copies of ""Young Guns"" sell on Amazon for 10 cents, and Mr. McCarthy is very much focused on his conference's re-election campaigns, hopping from fund-raiser to fund-raiser late into the night.""The difference between Eric and Paul and Kevin is that Kevin really likes politics,"" Mr. Feehery said. ""He's not particularly ideological, he likes to backslap with his colleagues, and he likes to get around and raise money.""Mike Franc, a former McCarthy policy aide, remembered Mr. McCarthy serving staff members fast-food Italian during late-night votes and developing a minor obsession with Vine, the now-defunct six-second video app, playing with it for hours in his office.If the Young Guns' personalities represented parts of a meal, Mr. Franc said, Mr. Ryan would be ""vegetables"" and Mr. Cantor ""good fish."" Mr. McCarthy, he said, ""is the maître d'.""PhotographRepublicans credit Representative Kevin McCarthy with unifying the opposition in the House to President Trump's impeachment.

| Jump to first hitRichard Spencer, ousted as Navy secretary after he publicly disagreed with President Trump's intervention in a war crimes case involving a Navy SEAL, is a lifelong Republican.WASHINGTON -- The Navy secretary ousted by President Trump said Thursday that he would endorse Michael R. Bloomberg for president, a high-profile defection that Mr. Bloomberg's allies hope will convince Democratic voters that their best chance of defeating Mr. Trump is the former mayor of New York.Richard V. Spencer, who was ousted as Navy secretary in November after he publicly disagreed with Mr. Trump's intervention in an extraordinary war crimes case involving a member of the Navy SEALs, is a lifelong Republican.In a telephone interview, he said he had never before voted for a Democrat, but was ready to do so now. His support could help the argument by Mr. Bloomberg that, as a successful businessman himself, he is uniquely qualified to take on Mr. Trump and become the next commander in chief.""We need a leader who can bring the country together,"" Mr. Spencer said, rather than the ""cleaving"" that he said had occurred under the stewardship of his former boss.""This is not about a party. This is not about left and right. It's about where can we find a solution to get the country working together and be unified, with an operable political system,"" he said.On Friday, Mr. Spencer, a former Marine, will join Mr. Bloomberg in Norfolk, Va., where the Democratic presidential hopeful will unveil his plan to address the economic and health concerns of veterans and military families. The area hosts major military bases, and is a favorite location for retired members of the armed services.Military communities are an important constituency in a number of Super Tuesday states, including Virginia.The endorsement of Mr. Spencer is significant because, as a former Trump political appointee, he is an embodiment of what many view as Mr. Bloomberg's greatest potential asset: that the candidate can make inroads with Republican voters in the November general election.In recent days, Mr. Bloomberg, whose campaign is fueled by a multibillion-dollar personal fortune, has authorized his campaign team to double his spending on television commercials in every market where he is advertising and expand his field staff to more than 2,000 people.Mr. Bloomberg's route to the Democratic nomination has so far veered sharply from those of his competitors. He is skipping the first four contests in February but is aggressively contesting the array of larger states that begin voting in March.While most Americans usually have no clue who the Navy secretary is, Mr. Spencer was at the center of one of Mr. Trump's most explosive confrontations with the Pentagon.In November, Mr. Trump, over the objections of senior Pentagon officials -- including Mr. Spencer -- reversed the demotion of a Navy SEAL commando, Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, and pardoned two other service members who were accused of war crimes.Mr. Spencer and top military leaders had sought to punish the three, arguing that leniency would affect morale, harm American troops in the field and undermine discipline. But the men were lionized by conservative commentators who portrayed them as war heroes unfairly prosecuted for actions taken in the heat of battle.Mr. Spencer threatened to resign, and Mr. Trump and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper took him up on the offer. The case dominated headlines in the days before Mr. Bloomberg began campaigning, and he addressed the blowup in his opening public remarks as a candidate at an event in Norfolk. Mr. Bloomberg derided Mr. Trump as a lawless leader and quoted Mr. Spencer's resignation letter.""I salute Secretary Spencer for not flinching from his duties,"" Mr. Bloomberg said at the time. ""But the fact remains, we have a president, a commander in chief, who has no respect for the rule of law and no concern whatsoever for ethics or honor, or for the values that truly make America great.""For his part, Chief Gallagher traveled in December to Mar-a-Lago, the president's resort in Florida, to personally thank Mr. Trump for his help, and officials close to the president have said that they want the commando to campaign alongside Mr. Trump this year.If that happens, Mr. Spencer could have an opportunity to make a powerful counterpoint.Bloomberg aides said the former mayor would present a plan on Friday in Norfolk that would seek to protect military families from the threat of deportation and provide service members with a fast track to naturalization for green card holders serving in the military.If elected, Mr. Bloomberg also would reverse Mr. Trump's ban on transgender people serving in the military and would eliminate co-pays for preventive health care services for veterans.PhotographRichard Spencer, President Trump's former Navy secretary, will join Michael R.

| Jump to first hitHe described the dangers of ""a horrible infection"" during an address whose inaccuracies required immediate clarification.WASHINGTON -- Sitting somberly behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, framed by his custom gold curtains, President Trump for the first time on Wednesday night acknowledged the seriousness of the coronavirus.The president who until now has tried to project a ""business as usual"" demeanor, even comparing the coronavirus to the everyday flu, confronted the fact that he faces a global pandemic that required a new set of rules, referred to the virus not as a workaday cold but as a ""horrible infection"" and announced new travel restrictions that he said would stop its spread.But his rare evening address to the nation also contained accusatory language and a defensive tone that were vintage Trump.He blamed European and Chinese people for bringing the outbreak to the United States, describing it ominously as a ""foreign virus,"" language that reflected the isolationist views of his chief speechwriter, Stephen Miller, who alongside Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, helped draft the address.He also appeared to minimize the damage the virus has already wreaked across the country, where there are now more than 1,200 active cases. Instead, he heaped praise on his administration's response when in reality, his attempts to play down the health crisis have been under fierce criticism for weeks.There were also surprising -- and significant -- inaccuracies in the speech, which administration officials and the president had to clarify almost immediately afterward. Mr. Trump said in his address he would suspend ""all travel from Europe to the United States,"" but the ban in fact applies to foreign citizens. And while he said the measure would ""apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo"" across the ocean, the order in fact affects only people.Throughout his 10-minute, uncharacteristically formal address, Mr. Trump struggled to find a middle ground between acknowledging the deepening crisis and diminishing its threat to the country's future.""This is not a financial crisis,"" he said. ""This is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome as a nation and as a world.""The speech capped a day when concerns about the risk of the virus seemed to reach a new pitch and measures to protect vulnerable populations began to upend the rhythms of daily life across the country -- many schools announced they would close indefinitely, some nursing homes barred visitors, and workplaces across the country urged their employees to work from home.But his measured tone belied the frustration Mr. Trump has been venting behind closed doors in recent days over the spread of the coronavirus, the tumbling financial markets it has caused and the blame he has directed at Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, for not making more moves to reduce the economic effect.Despite handing over the coronavirus portfolio to Vice President Mike Pence, Mr. Trump has been unable to let it go as he has watched the stock market plunge and the economy he has pinned his re-election hopes on suddenly falter. But it was Mr. Pence who played the biggest role in moving Mr. Trump to give a more forceful public statement, over many days, according to White House officials.Until Wednesday, Mr. Trump's response to the pandemic had been defined mostly by his own wishful thinking that projecting a ""business as usual"" approach would calm nerves and reassure the stock market.But the day's events convinced Mr. Trump that it was time for a response, prompting the president to upend his schedule, which included a private dinner at the residence of Mr. Pence, who also canceled a scheduled news briefing with the coronavirus task force to allow Mr. Trump to deliver the administration's message of the day.After Mr. Trump's speech, Stephanie Grisham, his press secretary, also announced the cancellation of the president's planned trip this week to Colorado and Las Vegas, citing ""an abundance of caution from the coronavirus outbreak.""Privately, the president has complained to advisers that he can no longer campaign for re-election the way he would like and insisted that concerns about the virus have been overblown.Mr. Trump had been particularly insistent on sticking with his plans for Las Vegas, where he was scheduled to address a large gathering of supporters on Saturday at the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas. His appearance there was only scrapped late Wednesday night and organizers earlier in the day said they had been told Mr. Trump planned to attend.Earlier in the week, Mr. Trump also had to be persuaded by several advisers to hold off on announcing a campaign rally in Florida that was scheduled for the end of March.""It will go away, just stay calm,"" the president said Tuesday after meeting with Republican senators on Capitol Hill, even as officials on his own coronavirus task force had publicly contradicted his ""nothing to see here"" message in a way that has rarely been seen before in the administration.Mr. Trump's first public response to the health crisis was on Jan. 31, when the administration announced it would bar entry by most foreign citizens who had recently visited China, and put some American travelers under a quarantine as it declared a rare public health emergency.The move was considered a significant step at the time, and Mr. Trump was lauded by Republicans for taking what some described as an unprecedented action to contain the spread of the virus.But officials have since conceded that those efforts at containment have not prevented the virus from spreading within communities around the United States.And as that spread has increased, Mr. Trump's administration has been criticized for a decision to dismantle a branch of the National Security Council devoted exclusively to global pandemics, and for a shortage of coronavirus test kits that until this week made it impossible to identify anyone who was infected.For his part, Mr. Trump has continually made false statements and misinformed the public about the severity of a virus that has left at least 37 people in the United States dead. Instead, his focus has been on repeating how well he thinks the response has gone rather than focusing on the response itself.Speaking last month at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where many lawmakers were exposed to an attendee infected with the virus, Mr. Trump said that his administration's response ""has been now given very good grades, like an A +++.Mr. Trump has claimed, falsely, that the number of cases in the United States would go down to ""close to zero."" He has been fact-checked in real time by members of his own coronavirus task force, for stating falsely that a vaccine would be available ""relatively soon.""And in his address Wednesday night, Mr. Trump repeated another theme -- that he viewed the virus as something that was inflicted upon him from a foreign country. He wanted to discuss ""our nation's unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak that started in China and is now spreading throughout the world,"" he said.Over the past month, Mr. Trump has been grasping at strands of good news in his briefings. In February, for instance, he repeated something he picked up in one: that viruses do not spread as fast in warmer temperatures.""A lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat,"" Mr. Trump told Fox News last month. In reality, however, it is not clear how coronavirus will change with the weather. And Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told members of Congress on Wednesday that when it came to the virus, ""we have got to assume it is going to get worse and worse and worse.""Behind the scenes, Mr. Kushner has taken an increasingly active role in the coronavirus response, and spent the day with the president on Wednesday.But he has also been among a small group of White House advisers who have reinforced Mr. Trump's belief that the news media is exaggerating the threat of the virus in an effort to damage the president, according to people familiar with the conversations in the West Wing.Republicans who have clashed with the White House said they remained skeptical about what the president could accomplish, even as he claimed on Twitter that he was ""prepared to use the full power of the Federal Government"" to confront the challenge posed by coronavirus.""For the foreseeable future, people are going to be looking for steady leadership and effective management, neither of which are his calling card,"" said Brendan Buck, a former aide to Speaker Paul D. Ryan. ""We don't know how long this will last or how bad it will be.""Annie Karni reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.PhotographPresident Trump announcing travel restrictions Wednesday during a speech from the Oval Office.

| Jump to first hitConsumer confidence has rebounded since recession warnings in the summer, particularly among voters who don't lean toward either major party.Americans are feeling better about the economy, a trend that, if it continues, could bolster President Trump's prospects for re-election in November.Forty percent of Americans say they are better off financially than they were a year ago, and just 19 percent say they are worse off, according to a January survey conducted for The New York Times by the online research firm SurveyMonkey. That's the most positive that respondents have been about the economy in the three years the survey has been conducted.Other measures of consumer confidence have likewise shown a strong rebound in recent months after falling last summer amid headlines warning of a looming recession.Views of the economy remain sharply divided along partisan lines, as they have throughout Mr. Trump's presidency. That could dampen the impact of the economy on the election because many voters may view economic news through the lens of their existing political preferences.But recent gains in confidence have been particularly strong among the voters most likely to be swayed by economic news: independents. True independents -- those who say they do not lean toward either major party -- had the biggest jump in confidence in the new Times survey.In a recent survey from The Washington Post and ABC News, 60 percent of independents said Mr. Trump was doing a good job with the economy, up from 46 percent in September.The increase in confidence among independents is a recent development and might not last. And some sources tell a different story: A long-running measure of consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan showed on Friday that confidence rose over all in January but fell slightly among independents, although confidence is up sharply among all partisan groups since the fall.The economy's performance is swaying some voters. Samuel Knight did not vote for Mr. Trump in 2016 because he and his evangelical Christian family did not like his personal behavior. But he said that if the election were held today, he would pull the lever for Mr. Trump, largely because of the strong economy.""It's probably the No. 1 thing that influences my vote,"" he said.Mr. Knight, who runs a start-up in Dallas that makes software for the construction industry, said he was not sure how much credit Mr. Trump deserved for the strong economy. But he said his customers have benefited from the administration's efforts to ease regulation, and he said he supported the president's approach on trade, even though it had driven up some costs.""I think we have the resources to outlast China, hands down,"" he said. ""I think it's a smart move.""Republicans are counting on voters like Mr. Knight to carry Mr. Trump to victory in November. The president routinely promotes strong economic data and the rising stock market in speeches and at rallies.""Are you better off now than you were three years ago?"" he asked on Twitter on Tuesday. ""Almost everyone says YES!""That argument ran into trouble over the summer when turmoil in financial markets and escalating trade tensions with China and other countries led to a surge in news coverage warning of a possible recession. Measures of consumer confidence fell in September and were slow to rebound.Economic growth cooled last year, according to data released by the Commerce Department on Thursday, and forecasters expect momentum to slow further in 2020. Still, recession fears have ebbed in recent months, as the job market has remained strong and the Federal Reserve has taken steps to prevent damage from the trade war from spreading to the broader economy. Now confidence appears to be rebounding as well.""There was this dark cloud hanging over us, but a lot of that has lifted,"" said Joseph Song, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He noted that wage growth had been picking up among lower-income workers, which could further bolster their economic outlook.Another factor could also be driving confidence: the stock market.Mr. Trump frequently cites the rising market as evidence that his policies are working. Experts generally reject that argument: Most Americans own few stocks, and the relationship between stock prices and economic growth is erratic at best. But research has found that the performance of major stock indexes can have a powerful influence on consumers' outlook.""It's something that is very public,"" Mr. Song said. ""It's the one broad measure that everyone knows to follow.""Still, it is not clear whether rising confidence will translate into more votes for Mr. Trump. Economic conditions have traditionally been among the best predictors of presidential elections. But Mr. Trump's approval rating is significantly weaker than past presidents' during similar periods of economic strength.""The fact that we're not seeing a corresponding uptick in presidential approval, that shows that the question of whether the economy will be less of a factor than in typical elections is still very much an open question,"" said Peter K. Enns, who leads the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at Cornell University.Debi Mazur-Hofmann is an independent voter outside Allentown, Pa. -- a part of the country that could prove pivotal in this fall's election. She said the economy was ""amazingly great,"" at least based on the stock market and the unemployment rate, and she said Mr. Trump probably deserved some credit.""He's done a good job regarding what we see in front of our eyes,"" she said. ""He did a lot for the people who are working, possibly.""But Ms. Mazur-Hofmann, 61, doubts the good times will last. She worries about the national debt and fears Mr. Trump will cut Social Security. And even if the economy remains strong, Ms. Mazur-Hofmann said, she will not vote for Mr. Trump in November because of how he treats people.""I'll never vote for Trump -- never, never, never in a million years,"" she said.Democrats on the campaign trail have not shied away from talking about the economy, although they describe it in very different terms than Mr. Trump does. Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, in particular, have run on policies that they say would reduce inequality and make the economy fairer. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has pledged to rebuild the middle class.Liberal groups are urging Democratic candidates to frame economic issues this year in a matter that could counter Mr. Trump's appeals.A national poll released this week by Navigator Research, which is overseen by leaders of several progressive organizations, tested voter agreement with various descriptions of the economy. It found that progressive messages scored best when they were phrased around disparities in how the economy was performing for the very rich compared with everyone else. For example: ""The gap between the wealthiest Americans and everyone else has never been bigger -- we need big, bold changes in Washington to unrig the economic system so working people can get ahead.""Democratic arguments are resonating with some voters. Rafael Corrales, 24, recently moved back home to Omaha, in part because rents in Seattle, where he had been living, climbed too high. An independent voter and the first member of his family to graduate from college, Mr. Corrales is now looking for work.His parents, a construction worker and a teacher's aide, have not seen a raise in years. Health insurance premiums keep going up. His friends are drowning in student debt.""Many of my friends have thousands of dollars in loans, and they still don't have a job in their field and they're working in a grocery store,"" he said. ""Maybe for people who do have money in the stock market or have higher earnings, it has improved. But for the average American, I don't think it has improved at all.""About the survey: The data in this article came from an online survey of 2,969 adults conducted by the polling firm SurveyMonkey from Jan. 6 to 12. The company selected respondents at random from the nearly three million people who take surveys on its platform each day. Responses were weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States. The survey has a modeled error estimate (similar to a margin of error in a standard telephone poll) of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant.PhotographSamuel Knight said the economy might make him vote for President Trump.

| Jump to first hitThe president's legal team completed its impeachment defense and Republicans huddled to discuss whether to call new witnesses.WASHINGTON -- President Trump's defense team appealed to the Senate on Tuesday to disregard a new account by the former national security adviser John R. Bolton that bolsters the impeachment case against the president. But by day's end, Republican leaders working feverishly to block testimony from Mr. Bolton or other witnesses indicated they had not yet corralled the votes to do so.On the final day of arguments on Mr. Trump's behalf, Jay Sekulow, one of the president's private lawyers, sought to raise doubts about Mr. Bolton's claim in an unpublished manuscript that Mr. Trump tied the release of military aid to Ukraine to investigations into his political rivals, calling it an ""unsourced allegation"" that was ""inadmissible"" in his impeachment trial.Just after Mr. Trump's team ended a three-day legal defense, Republican senators rushed into a private meeting room in the Capitol, where Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, worked to herd his rank and file in line behind ending the trial without witnesses.He carried a card that bore a tally of Republican votes on the question, and warned that he did not yet have enough to block an expected Democratic move to call witnesses because some Republicans remained uncommitted, according to people familiar with the meeting who were not authorized to discuss it publicly.""It was a serious family discussion,"" Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, told reporters as he emerged from the senators-only meeting in the Strom Thurmond Room. ""Some people are sincerely exploring all the avenues.""But behind the scenes, key Republicans said they were increasingly confident they could bring the trial to an end, and they described Mr. McConnell's comments as a pointed signal that it was time for rank-and-file senators to fall in line.The talks unfolded after Mr. Trump's team essentially rested its case against removing him from office, ending oral arguments by urging senators to ignore what Mr. Bolton might have to say. Without directly denying the veracity of his account, whose existence was first reported by The New York Times, Mr. Sekulow argued that the behavior Mr. Bolton described had no place in the discussion of the president's fate.Impeachment ""is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts,"" Mr. Sekulow said. ""That is politics, unfortunately. Hamilton put impeachment in the hands of this body, the Senate, precisely and specifically to be above that fray.""The argument was a bid to quiet the anger and anxiety that Mr. Bolton's revelation prompted in Republican ranks when it emerged on Sunday at a critical stage in Mr. Trump's impeachment trial. Conservatives said the case for moving directly to acquittal without new testimony or documents was overwhelming, but key moderates, including Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, said they were still undecided.Two Republicans, Senators Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine, have said they would most likely vote for witnesses, but Democrats would need four Republicans to join them in order to prevail. Another moderate, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, indicated earlier in the day that ""Mr. Bolton probably has some things that would be helpful for us.""Inside the private meeting on Tuesday, Mr. McConnell and his allies warned that allowing witnesses would blow the trial wide open and potentially prolong it by weeks. Clutching his whip count of yeses, noes and maybes, Mr. McConnell appeared to be suggesting that undecided senators needed to make up their minds and join the majority of their colleagues in opposing witnesses.The activity inside and outside the Senate chamber underscored how Mr. Bolton's account has threatened to upend the trial, injecting an element of unpredictability into a proceeding that had appeared headed for Mr. Trump's acquittal by week's end.The longtime Republican foreign policy figure has made clear that he would testify if called, but senators also know that regardless of his account, there is almost no chance that the Republican-controlled chamber would vote to convict Mr. Trump and remove him from office less than 10 months before a presidential election. A 67-vote supermajority would be needed to do so.How they proceed now could have significant political ramifications not just for Mr. Trump, but also for Republican senators up for re-election in swing states this fall who want to show voters that they conducted a fair trial.Democrats prepared to accuse Republicans of a cover-up if they do not vote for witnesses pounced on Mr. Sekulow's remarks about Mr. Bolton, saying that his reference to ""unsourced allegations"" proved their point that the Senate must subpoena him to clarify his precise account.""Once again, the president's team, in a way that only they could, have further made the case for calling John Bolton,"" Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the lead House manager, told reporters during a break in the proceedings.Proponents of calling Mr. Bolton also got an unexpected bit of support late Monday from John F. Kelly, the former White House chief of staff, who told an audience in Florida that he believed Mr. Bolton's account and supported the Senate seeking direct witnesses.""I think some of the conversations seem to me to be very inappropriate, but I wasn't there,"" he said, according to The Sarasota Herald-Tribune. ""But there are people that were there that ought to be heard from.""Republican leaders appeared to be slowing down what had been a breakneck trial schedule to allow for fuller consideration of the matter. They were hopeful that by putting distance between the emergence of Mr. Bolton's account and the vote on witnesses, tensions would cool enough to hold a majority intact.""We're trying to get everyone on the same page,"" said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas.Beginning Wednesday, senators will have up to 16 hours over two days to question the prosecution and defense teams. Much of that time will probably be used to allow the two sides to respond to each other's arguments, but Democrats and Republicans were also preparing pointed questions intended to highlight soft spots in the respective cases.At the White House, Mr. Trump was uncharacteristically quiet about the proceedings, which he has followed on television in recent days. He sought to put his policy agenda on full display, unveiling a long-awaited Middle East peace plan.But as he traveled back from a political rally in New Jersey on Tuesday evening, Mr. Trump provided encouragement for the Republican leaders' fighting to bypass witnesses.""No matter how many witnesses you give the Democrats, no matter how much information is given, like the quickly produced Transcripts, it will NEVER be enough for them,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""They will always scream UNFAIR.""Inside the Senate chamber, Mr. Sekulow and two White House lawyers delivered a voluble and indignant final defense, capping three days of oral arguments on the president's behalf against the House's abuse of power and obstruction of Congress charges.On Saturday, they began by accusing Democrats of conducting a witch hunt with a predetermined outcome: removing Mr. Trump not only from office but from the 2020 presidential ballot. They told senators that the House managers had cherry-picked the facts they liked and hid others that were more flattering to the president. And they directly contradicted Democrats' reading of a July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and Ukraine's president, asserting that Mr. Trump had acted well within his rights as chief executive.On Monday, the lawyers took aim at former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden, resurfacing unsubstantiated accusations of corruption to contend that Mr. Trump had been acting reasonably when he asked Ukraine to investigate the pair. They played down the role of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer at the center of the Ukraine pressure campaign, calling him a ""colorful distraction"" Democrats used to obscure a weak case against Mr. Trump. And they trotted out two legal celebrities, Ken Starr and Alan M. Dershowitz, to make the case that the House's charges did not rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors.Many Republicans moved quickly on Tuesday to adopt Mr. Dershowitz's arguments that abuse of power and obstruction of Congress were not impeachable offenses. The argument cut against the legal consensus, and against Mr. Dershowitz's own earlier views, that impeachable offenses need not be crimes.""I listened to Ken Starr and Dershowitz loud and clear yesterday,"" said Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina. ""The whole premise of the impeachment, I think, is false. I don't think we need witnesses.""Punctuating his remarks on Tuesday with a refrain of ""danger, danger, danger,"" Mr. Sekulow insisted that the managers' case was built solely on a policy dispute with the president over his push to combat corruption in Ukraine.""If that becomes the new normal, future presidents, Democrats and Republicans, will be paralyzed the moment they are elected, even before they can take the oath of office,"" Mr. Sekulow said. ""The bar for impeachment cannot be set this low.""Despite his warnings, Mr. Sekulow did not directly deny Mr. Bolton's account, instead reading aloud from statements by Mr. Trump, the Justice Department and the vice president's office contesting it.Democrats spent three days last week arguing just the opposite. They said that the House's two-month investigation concluded that Mr. Trump had used the powers of his office not in the pursuit of a policy objective but for his own political advantage. When he was caught, they argued, he sought to conceal what he had done by ordering an across the board defiance of their investigationClocking in at under an hour and a half, the bare-bones closing argument from Mr. Trump's lawyers underscored their confidence in the final outcome. In the end, they used less than half of the 24 hours available to them to present a case to senators.Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, ended Tuesday's presentation by playing a highlight reel of House and Senate Democrats arguing against a partisan impeachment in 1998, including Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, one of the House managers, and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.""You were right,"" Mr. Cipollone said, looking directly at Mr. Schumer.""All you need in this case are the Constitution and your common sense,"" Mr. Cipollone sad. ""The articles of impeachment fall far short of any constitutional standard, and they are dangerous.""Reporting was contributed by Carl Hulse, Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Emily Cochrane and Catie Edmondson.Reporting was contributed by Carl Hulse, Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Emily Cochrane and Catie Edmondson.PhotographThe defense lawyers Pat Cipollone, left, and Jay Sekulow.

| Jump to first hitIn an internal memo, Andrew Bosworth said he ""desperately"" wanted the president to lose. But, he said, the company should avoid hurting Mr. Trump's campaign.SAN FRANCISCO -- Since the 2016 election, when Russian trolls and a tsunami of misinformation turned social media into a partisan battlefield, Facebook has wrestled with the role it played in President Trump's victory.Now, according to a memo obtained by The New York Times, a longtime Facebook executive has told employees that the company had a moral duty not to tilt the scales against Mr. Trump as he seeks re-election.On Dec. 30, Andrew Bosworth, the head of Facebook's virtual and augmented reality division, wrote on his internal Facebook page that, as a liberal, he found himself wanting to use the social network's powerful platform against Mr. Trump. But citing the ""Lord of the Rings"" franchise and the philosopher John Rawls, Mr. Bosworth said that doing so would eventually backfire.""I find myself desperately wanting to pull any lever at my disposal to avoid the same result,"" he wrote. ""So what stays my hand? I find myself thinking of the Lord of the Rings at this moment.""Specifically when Frodo offers the ring to Galadrial and she imagines using the power righteously, at first, but knows it will eventually corrupt her,"" he said, misspelling the name of the character Galadriel. ""As tempting as it is to use the tools available to us to change the outcome, I am confident we must never do that or we will become that which we fear.""In a meandering 2,500-word post, titled ""Thoughts for 2020,"" Mr. Bosworth weighed in on issues including political polarization, Russian interference and the news media's treatment of Facebook. He gave a frank assessment of Facebook's shortcomings in recent years, saying that the company had been ""late"" to address the issues of data security, misinformation and foreign interference. And he accused the left of overreach, saying that when it came to calling people Nazis, ""I think my fellow liberals are a bit too, well, liberal.""Mr. Bosworth also waded into the debate over the health effects of social media, rejecting what he called ""wildly offensive"" comparisons of Facebook to addictive substances like nicotine. He instead compared Facebook to sugar, and said users were responsible for moderating their own intake.""If I want to eat sugar and die an early death that is a valid position,"" Mr. Bosworth wrote. ""My grandfather took such a stance towards bacon and I admired him for it. And social media is likely much less fatal than bacon.""The post by Mr. Bosworth, a former head of Facebook's advertising team, provides an unusually candid glimpse of the debates raging within Facebook about the platform's responsibilities as it heads into the 2020 election.The biggest of those debates is whether Facebook should change its rules governing political speech. Posts by politicians are exempt from many of Facebook's current rules, and their ads are not submitted for fact-checking, giving them license to mislead voters with partisan misinformation.Last year, platforms like Twitter and Google announced restrictions to their political advertising tools ahead of the 2020 election.Facebook and its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, have faced heavy pressure from Democrats and Republicans, including Mr. Trump's campaign, not to restrict its own powerful ad platform, which allows political campaigns to reach targeted audiences and raise money from supporters. But other politicians, and some Facebook employees, including a group that petitioned Mr. Zuckerberg in October, have argued that the social network has a responsibility to stamp out misinformation on its platform, including in posts by politicians.Mr. Bosworth said that even though keeping the current policies in place ""very well may lead to"" Mr. Trump's re-election, it was the right decision.Dozens of Facebook employees pushed back on Mr. Bosworth's conclusions, arguing in the comments section below his post that politicians should be held to the same standard as other Facebook users. They debated whether Facebook should ban or remove posts by politicians, including Mr. Trump, that included hate speech or forms of misinformation.One Facebook employee warned that if the company continued to take its current approach, it risked promoting populist leaders around the world, including in the United States.A Facebook spokeswoman provided a statement from Mr. Bosworth in which he said that the post ""wasn't written for public consumption,"" but that he ""hoped this post would encourage my co-workers to continue to accept criticism with grace as we accept the responsibility we have overseeing our platform.""Ultimately, the decision on whether to allow politicians to spread misinformation on Facebook rests with Mr. Zuckerberg. In recent months, he has appeared to stand firm on the decision to keep the existing ad policies in place, saying that he believes Facebook should not become an arbiter of truth. But he has also left himself room to change his mind. In November, a Facebook spokesman said the company was ""looking at different ways we might refine our approach to political ads.""Among those lobbying Mr. Zuckerberg is President Trump himself, who claimed on a radio show on Monday that Mr. Zuckerberg had congratulated him on being ""No. 1"" on Facebook during a private dinner.Mr. Bosworth said he believed Facebook was responsible for Mr. Trump's 2016 election victory, but not because of Russian interference or the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which millions of Facebook users' data was leaked to a political strategy firm that worked with the Trump campaign. Mr. Bosworth said the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica revelations -- uncovered by The Times, working with The Observer of London and The Guardian -- rightly changed the conversation around how Facebook should handle user data, and which companies should be given access to that data.But, he said, Mr. Trump simply used Facebook's advertising tools effectively.""He didn't get elected because of Russia or misinformation or Cambridge Analytica,"" Mr. Bosworth wrote. ""He got elected because he ran the single best digital ad campaign I've ever seen from any advertiser. Period.""Mr. Bosworth, a longtime confidant of Mr. Zuckerberg's who is viewed by some inside Facebook as a proxy for the chief executive, has been an outspoken defender of the company's positions in the past.In 2018, BuzzFeed News published a memo Mr. Bosworth wrote in 2016 justifying the company's growth-at-all-costs ethos, in which he said the company's mission of connecting people was ""de facto good,"" even if it resulted in deaths.After the memo's publication, a Facebook executive said the company wished it could ""go back and hit delete"" on Mr. Bosworth's 2016 post.PhotographAn internal memo by Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook executive, warned employees not to tilt the scales against President Trump's re-election bid.

| Jump to first hitThe three major presidential candidates have quickly pivoted to try to shape a new political discourse, as they face a real-time test of leadership in a national crisis.WASHINGTON -- For the past year, the Democratic presidential candidates debated the merits of sweeping liberal ideas, fretted over notions of electability and bias, and rose and fell in the polls as voters struggled to choose a front-runner. And through it all, President Trump sniped from the sidelines, demonizing the party and its 2020 contenders as socialists.Almost overnight, everything has changed. Amid deepening uncertainty over a spreading virus and growing anxiety about an economic meltdown, that kind of classic presidential campaign ended and something extraordinary has begun: a real-time, life-or-death test of competency and leadership for those seeking the White House this November.Over 18 hours from Wednesday night through Thursday afternoon, the three major candidates for the presidency, including the incumbent, made quick pivots to shape and guide the country's new political discourse. It was an attempt to demonstrate how they would lead Americans across a muddled terrain of social disruption and stock market collapse, of worry about testing kits and concern about travel bans and crowd sizes.Just hours after Mr. Trump delivered a wooden address from the Oval Office, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. sought to position himself as a sober steward of the national interest, delivering a speech echoing the language and tone of addresses given by presidents in moments of crisis. Mr. Biden also went much further than Mr. Trump in proposing a detailed plan and a set of goals on testing, increasing hospital capacity and supporting an accelerated push for a vaccine.""This virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration,"" Mr. Biden said, standing in front of a backdrop of American flags. ""Public fears are being compounded by pervasive lack of trust in this president, fueled by adversarial relationships with the truth that he continues to have.""With his sharp criticisms of Mr. Trump's shifting statements about the crisis, and the administration's inability to stem the falling stock market, Mr. Biden was also taking direct aim at Mr. Trump's oft-heard arguments for re-election in November.The spread of the virus is rapidly becoming a test of Mr. Trump's core message: that despite the controversy the president creates, Americans are better off economically than before he took office and should stick with him, rather than siding with Democrats whom Mr. Trump portrays as feckless half-wits who botched the Iowa caucuses and much more.Now it is Mr. Trump who risks looking out of his depth to many Americans, not only in protecting their health but also in guarding their 401(k)s.Two hours after Mr. Biden spoke, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- the other leading candidate for the Democratic nomination -- warned that the death toll of Americans from the coronavirus could exceed the number of U.S. soldiers killed during World War II.""We have an administration that is largely incompetent and whose incompetence and recklessness have threatened the lives of many, many people in this country,"" Mr. Sanders said.The setting of the speeches underscored the unusual situation the campaigns now face. Normally at this time candidates would be traveling the country, rallying supporters at town hall meetings, fund-raisers and mass rallies. But both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have curtailed their travel and canceled big gatherings because of the virus, and on Thursday they found themselves addressing small groups of reporters in sparse hotel ballrooms in their hometowns, Wilmington, Del., and Burlington, Vt.Political strategists compared the virus to a hurricane, a deeply disruptive event likely to affect broad swaths of the country in unpredictable and devastating ways. The response to those moments can make or break a political career, they say.""You don't blame the elected officials for causing the damage that the hurricane ravages across the state,"" said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster with experience on presidential and Senate campaigns. ""You evaluate elected officials on how they handle the situation.""Even as the fate of the country's health remains uncertain, the dynamics of the primary race are clarifying. After a series of primary wins, Mr. Biden now has a delegate lead that would require a nearly impossible turnaround from Mr. Sanders to overcome.That leaves Mr. Trump likely to face an opponent whom he spent much of 2019 trying to destroy. Yet, in a moment of crisis, some Democrats argue that the country may turn to a creature of the Washington establishment, seeing Mr. Biden as an experienced hand.""A lot of people, not just Democrats, are going to start looking to Mr. Biden and sizing him up. It's a real-time test at some level,"" said Addisu Demissie, who managed the presidential campaign of Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey. ""Even though he doesn't have authority, he can show and not tell what four years of a Biden presidency would feel like.""In particular, Democrats believe the virus will help them hold more moderate, independent suburban voters who don't like the president's tone but have stayed with him because of the strong economy. The party won control of the House in 2018 largely on the strength of their support among those voters, flipping a number of seats in battleground districts. Exit polling from Tuesday's primaries showed that a majority of voters saw Mr. Biden as the candidate they trusted most to handle a major crisis.For rural voters, who are more likely to vote for Republicans, the economic ramifications could affect their bottom lines, particularly farmers and oil workers who are already hurting from trade policies.Yet, the fiercely partisan moment in Washington has scrambled the politics of unity that traditionally kick into place during times of national crisis. The partisan divide is so pervasive that it has affected not only people's feelings about the president's response, but also their fears about the virus itself.Roughly six in 10 Republican voters nationwide said they were not particularly concerned that the coronavirus would disrupt their lives, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released this week. Democratic voters were twice as likely as Republicans to say they are concerned.While privately concerned about the impact on the president's re-election prospects, Republicans are largely following Mr. Trump's lead in minimizing the worries over the coronavirus and blaming Democrats and the media for focusing on the deaths it has caused.""One thing the press has not covered at all is the people who have really recovered,"" said Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a Republican ally of Mr. Trump's. ""Right now all people are hearing about are the deaths. I'm sure the deaths are horrific, but the flip side of this is the vast majority of people who get coronavirus do survive.""In recent days, Mr. Trump and his administration have taken a more active hand in the public messaging around the response. But senior public health officials have frequently contradicted or corrected statements made by the president; in the late hours of Wednesday evening various administration officials corrected four separate policies that Mr. Trump had announced during his nationally televised address.On Thursday morning, after news broke that an aide to the Brazilian president had tested positive for the coronavirus days after being in proximity to Mr. Trump at his South Florida hotel, Mr. Trump said he was not worried. The White House later said he had not been tested for the virus himself.""Let's put it this way,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I'm not concerned.""As the election year progresses into unknown territory, the candidates must now find ways to motivate voters from a distance. A number of Mr. Biden's donors and supporters were quietly nervous about the effect that the coronavirus could have on events large and small in coming weeks, saying it had injected a fresh measure of uncertainty into the race.Scheduled Biden campaign events in Chicago and Miami are being transformed into ""virtual events"" ahead of next Tuesday's primaries in Arizona, Illinois, Florida and Ohio. On Thursday, both the Biden and Sanders campaigns instructed staff members to begin working from home.Mr. Trump appears to be stopping all campaign-related events indefinitely, which would remove a major political weapon from his arsenal as he moves into the general election campaign.Beyond the rallies, the virus throws into question nearly every mechanism of modern campaigning. Already, officials in Arizona, Ohio and Illinois are scrambling to move polling places out of nursing homes -- with early voting already well underway.On Thursday, the Democratic National Committee announced it would move Sunday's presidential debate to Washington from Phoenix to minimize travel. At least nine members of Congress have self-quarantined after exposure to the virus, including several who had interactions with the president. Across the country, political events are being canceled, including some state party conventions where the delegates who vote on the nominee are elected.Democratic activists are exploring ways to expand their virtual organizing efforts through Facebook and text. Abortion rights activists are planning a ""virtual call center"" on Sunday to support a Democrat challenging an incumbent in the Chicago suburbs. The Democratic Party of Wisconsin on Thursday canceled all in-person voter canvassing ahead of the state's April 7 elections.""As a campaign, it is completely against every instinct you have: no fund-raising and no big events,"" said David Pepper, the chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party. ""In the final week of a primary that's the opposite of everything you'd want to do.""Yet the questions go well beyond mass events and voting and will only get more challenging the longer the virus continues to disrupt social contact. What's a baby-kissing politician supposed to do when he cannot kiss a baby? How do you gather staff members in a war room, if they can't be in the same room? Can volunteers go knocking on doors in affected areas? If the campaign moves even more online, can officials protect against a heightened threat of election interference and disinformation?It's not known how long the coronavirus and its aftereffects will affect the election or be paramount on voters' minds.""There's a long time until the election,"" said Corry Bliss, who ran the House Republicans' super PAC in 2018. ""Last month, the world was convinced the only thing that would matter in 2020 was impeachment.""Giovanni Russonello contributed reporting from New York.PhotographJoseph R.

| Jump to first hitOnce acquaintances as members of the wealthy Manhattan elite, Michael Bloomberg and President Trump have become bitter rivals. And a flurry of Bloomberg attack ads is angering the president.WASHINGTON -- A few days after Election Day in 2016, Donald J. Trump received a call on his cellphone from Michael R. Bloomberg, an old acquaintance he had clashed with during the campaign.Mr. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, had called to offer his congratulations, but the president-elect cut him off.""You were very mean to me!"" Mr. Trump said, according to people familiar with the call. Mr. Trump was referring to Mr. Bloomberg's slashing speech that year at the Democratic National Convention, during which he called the Republican a ""con"" and called on voters to elect a ""sane, competent person.""Mr. Trump settled down almost immediately, then turned the conversation toward his latest predicament: quickly hiring people to fill out his government.Mr. Bloomberg, according to the people briefed on the call, told him that when he was first elected mayor in 2001, he, too, had never served in government. What Mr. Trump should do, Mr. Bloomberg advised, was to ""hire a lot of people smarter than you.""""Mike,"" Mr. Trump replied tersely, ""there is no one smarter than me."" A startled Mr. Bloomberg paused before turning the conversation to a less fraught subject: golf.The 10-minute phone conversation was the last time the two men spoke.Mr. Bloomberg is now pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into an effort to become the Democratic presidential nominee, an unprecedented self-financed campaign that the party's top-polling candidates have mostly ignored. But much of Mr. Bloomberg's spending does not promote his own campaign at all, and instead attacks Mr. Trump on issues like health care and integrity in the military -- a blitz of negative television ads that has managed to anger the president.Mr. Bloomberg has taunted Mr. Trump in other ways. He bought a Google search ad criticizing Mr. Trump that appeared prominently when users searched for the word ""impeachment.""Though aides have implored him not to take the bait, Mr. Trump has been unable to resist. He has branded Mr. Bloomberg, who is 5 feet 7 inches tall, as ""Mini Mike"" on Twitter, and sparred with him over health care. He has also told aides that Mr. Bloomberg is a ""bad guy.""When it was disclosed that Mr. Bloomberg had bought a Super Bowl ad for about $10 million, for instance, the president's re-election campaign, within hours, said that it had also bought a $10 million ad to be aired during the game.As members of Manhattan's wealthy elite for decades, Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Trump, while never friends, sometimes crossed paths at a charity golf game or a fund-raiser. Over the years they have boosted each other when it served to boost themselves.Mr. Trump often praised Mr. Bloomberg's leadership of New York City. And Mr. Bloomberg gave him an implicit stamp of approval when he twice appeared on Mr. Trump's reality TV show, ""The Apprentice,"" and when his administration awarded Mr. Trump a city contract to refurbish a golf course.In 2008, Mr. Bloomberg joined Mr. Trump, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Joe Torre, the former Yankees manager, for an event at Mr. Trump's golf course in Westchester County, N.Y., where they were photographed grinning together in matching tightly fitted caps.Both men now play down any moments of bonhomie from their past.Like Mr. Trump before him, Mr. Bloomberg had flirted with running for president for so long, it had become something of a political punch line until he actually jumped into the race in November.As Mr. Bloomberg weighed a presidential run last winter, some Trump advisers thought he would make a useful target for Mr. Trump, always in need of a foil, because of his history of trying to ban sugary drinks in New York City and his advocacy against guns. But on an intuitive level, Mr. Trump is keenly aware of how things play on television and the potency of running as a change agent. Frustrated, he has recently told associates that Mr. Bloomberg is ""trying to buy the election,"" and noted that even he himself took donations in his 2016 campaign.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Bloomberg's transactionalism -- and interest in winning whatever contest he is part of -- also has echoes of Mr. Trump's approach.Both men built up their fortunes in the 1980s in New York -- one a self-made billionaire who spent his money lavishly, the other born into privilege and often described as frugal -- slapping their names on their companies and their products. Mr. Trump, a garrulous entertainer, was a contrast with Mr. Bloomberg, a dry-humored businessman whose Massachusetts accent has never totally faded.By the time Mr. Bloomberg took office in 2002, Mr. Trump was not a builder in New York City so much as an entertainer, a brander and a licenser, and so had less business to conduct with Mr. Bloomberg than with two of the previous mayors, Mr. Giuliani and Ed Koch. Mr. Trump had a famously cantankerous relationship with Mr. Koch, but needed support from him and from Mr. Giuliani for his development projects.Mr. Trump, after backing Democrats when Mr. Bloomberg was running for mayor as a Republican in 2001, became a full-throated supporter of the new mayor, as their daughters Ivanka Trump and Georgina Bloomberg appeared in a documentary about children of privilege, lamenting the complexity of their lives.""We are friends, we were before her father was elected and it's not going to change after,"" Ms. Bloomberg wrote in an email in 2018, before her father made his presidential ambitions official. ""I'm not a fan of him or his politics, but you don't stop being friends with someone because of the actions of a family member.""When Mr. Bloomberg began looking at a way to undo the city's two-term limit so he could run again, a move that was successful but that infuriated a number of New Yorkers and some elected officials, Mr. Trump defended the idea.Term limits are ""a terrible idea, an artificial barrier,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Why is he being told he cannot run again?""Mr. Bloomberg twice appeared on ""The Apprentice,"" an opportunity aides said helped him boost the city's ""Made in NY"" tax credit initiative. In one episode, Mr. Bloomberg judged a hot dog competition.""As the No. 1 frank-ophile in the city, I'm supposed to see if you can cut the mustard,"" Mr. Bloomberg told an all-female team on the episode, in 2004. ""I can't tell whether these are better or worse than the one the men are selling until I have a hot dog with the men. But I can tell you without seeing the men -- you look better.""In 2011, the Bloomberg administration awarded a contract to the Trump Organization to operate and manage a Bronx golf course that had been a boondoggle for decades. The city had completed almost all of the construction, with growing the grass and building a clubhouse and concession stands left to Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump has described the project as one that he saved, similar to his work on the city's Wollman Rink in the 1980s. In a 2015 blog post, Ms. Trump wrote about how her father had arrived on the site of the golf course and ended 20 years of mismanagement. That description rankled former Bloomberg officials, who called it exaggerated.During the Bloomberg mayoral years, Mr. Trump became more socially conservative, as Mr. Bloomberg became more socially liberal. Mr. Bloomberg embraced the movement for stricter gun regulation, an effort for which Mr. Trump -- now tightly aligned with the National Rifle Association -- once praised him for even though he didn't support the policy. He said the mayor was ""putting his money where his mouth is.""Mr. Trump would often say that the Bloomberg mayoralty had been ""good for me,"" recalled Sam Nunberg, a former aide to Mr. Trump.But Mr. Trump has given conflicting assessments of Mr. Bloomberg's prospects as a presidential contender. When Mr. Bloomberg was mentioned as a possible presidential candidate shortly after he left office at the end of 2013, Mr. Trump's advisers told him he would never gain traction.""He's a political basket case -- you don't know if he's a Republican, you don't know if he's a Democrat, he's all over the place,"" Mr. Nunberg said at that time.But in that same year Mr. Trump praised Mr. Bloomberg, noting he had done a ""very good job"" as mayor and mused in a Fox News interview that Mr. Bloomberg was probably interested in higher office. He is ""going to be out there very strongly in some form,"" Mr. Trump said.By early 2016, Mr. Bloomberg had ruled out a campaign of his own as an independent, in part because he said he feared helping elect Mr. Trump, whose candidacy he had described with growing alarm as he watched from the sidelines.When he endorsed Hillary Clinton, her aides thought his backing would resonate with independent and persuadable Republican voters, and asked him to make that pitch at the Democratic National Convention.""Bloomberg was someone who had a long history with Trump, who could speak as a fellow billionaire and fellow New Yorker to what and who the real Donald Trump was,"" said Jim Margolis, a former aide to Ms. Clinton who helped organize the convention.That speech resonated with Mr. Trump as well.""'Little' Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me,"" Mr. Trump said on Twitter soon after the speech. ""His last term as Mayor was a disaster!""PhotographMichael R. Bloomberg and Donald J. Trump sometimes crossed paths at charity golf tournaments.

| Jump to first hitThe bill allots as much as $23.5 billion in assistance to farmers, a key constituency of President Trump's, in the middle of an election year.WASHINGTON -- After providing nearly $26 billion in aid to farmers over the past few years to offset losses from President Trump's trade war with China, the administration now has another giant new pot of money to pass out to them with little or no oversight, courtesy of the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package.The legislation, given final passage by the House on Friday and quickly signed into law by Mr. Trump, allocates as much as $23.5 billion in assistance for farmers and gives broad leeway to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to direct it where he sees fit.The money was inserted into the bill by senators from farm states after an intense lobbying push by major corporate farming groups. Parts of the industry are suffering immediate hits from the coronavirus outbreak, such as corn growers who have seen prices for ethanol plummet and mom-and-pop suppliers of farm markets that have closed in many cities.But unlike industries such as airlines, hotels and automakers, which have largely or completely shut down, most farms are still operating. And sales of some products in the industry have surged as worried consumers stock up, generating shortages of meat, chicken, eggs and flour.The law provides Mr. Perdue with $9.5 billion to support farmers, including livestock producers, suppliers of farm markets and producers of specialty crops, and $14 billion in borrowing authority to replenish the fund he used to make trade-related payments to farmers in the past two years. The department's entire discretionary budget request for next year is about $23 billion.The Agriculture Department will also receive an additional $25.1 billion for food aid programs for poor families from the stimulus bill.""We are effectively subsiding every other sector of the economy"" in the $2 trillion stimulus package, said Joshua Sewell, a farming industry analyst at Taxpayers for Common Sense, which advocates less government spending. ""So I guess the argument goes that agriculture wants its piece of the pie, too.""The administration's use of the money will become a major political factor in rural America in the middle of an election year in which Midwestern states could be pivotal, said Lawrence R. Jacobs, the director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at University of Minnesota. He predicted that Mr. Trump would soon be trumpeting it as part of his re-election campaign.""This is just an extraordinary and unprecedented opportunity in the modern era for a president to dole out cash,"" he said. ""In urban areas, they call this walking around money, which a politician hands out to secure support.""A small army of groups mounted the fast-moving campaign for aid, including the politically powerful American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. Joining them were other smaller players representing producers of goods like turkey, pork and potatoes or sunflowers, sorghum, peanuts and eggs.Among their targets were farm-state lawmakers like Senators John Hoeven of North Dakota, who pressed for $50 billion in aid for agriculture. Others included Senators Pat Roberts of Kansas, John Thune of South Dakota and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. All are Republicans who serve on the Senate agriculture committee or the appropriations subcommittee that oversees farm aid.Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the agriculture committee, was also lobbied.""We want to make sure that farmers, ranchers and rural Americans are also recognized as needing assistance,"" said Dale Moore, the executive vice president of the American Farm Bureau and a former chief of staff at the Agriculture Department.Farmers in Midwestern states like Iowa, Illinois and Minnesota -- as well as in Texas and Kansas -- reaped much of the $26 billion spent in the past two years to blunt the economic effect of the administration's trade policies, according to Joseph W. Glauber of the International Food Policy Research Institute.Without those payments, net farm income last year would have dropped about 5 percent, he estimated. Instead, it rose nearly 12 percent.Seth Meyer, an agricultural economist with the University of Missouri, said the economic blow to agriculture from the virus could be harder to offset than the lost sales from trade policy.""If you are producing flowers and there is no wedding this summer, if you were a fruit and vegetable grower selling through a restaurant wholesaler, what do you do now?"" he asked. ""What if you are a milk producer selling your product to a processor who has trouble organizing transportation and labor?""The bottom line, he said, could be a bigger effect on farmers than that created by the trade friction with China -- ""much bigger, potentially.""Still, some parts of the industry are seeing benefits from the pandemic. Some big meat producers, including Tyson Foods, announced special bonuses this week for farmers to reward them for the increase in work to keep supermarket shelves stocked.In general, farmers have weathered recessions better than other economic groups, because while consumers cut purchases of goods like clothing and change their eating habits to save money, they always need food. This downturn is fundamentally different from others in many ways, but Wall Street analysts are issuing bullish predictions for parts of the agriculture industry based on the surge in demand for products like beef and chicken.""Meat is flying off the shelves"" wrote Ken Goldman, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, who upgraded the stocks of Tyson and Sanderson Farms, two major chicken and meat producers. ""We now believe that outstanding retail demand for meat is more than offsetting soft demand at food service.""Prices being paid to farmers raising cattle and other animals have dropped in recent weeks, reflecting declines in financial markets worldwide and disruptions in supply chains, although these prices recovered somewhat this week.Major meatpackers are drawing scrutiny as demand rises, amid some suspicion that they are gaming the system to push up their own profits at the expense of farmers and consumers.""If packers are illegally manipulating markets during crisis we need USDA & DOJ & CFTC to investigate + help farmers,"" Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, wrote on Twitter on Friday, referring to the Department of Justice and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency that regulates markets where these goods are bought and sold.Congress imposed almost no limit on how Mr. Perdue spends the money, suggesting only that the $9.5 billion chunk be used to support a wide range of agricultural producers. The legislation set aside $750,000 for the agency's inspector general for ""conducting audits and investigations of projects and activities carried out with funds.""Similarly, with the $14 billion for the Commodity Credit Corporation, there is very little guidance on how that money can be spent other than it be used for an ""emergency requirement.""With the streets empty, cars parked and demand for fuel depressed, corn growers are among the most likely recipients. Mr. Meyer of the University of Missouri said about 40 percent of corn production goes into the ethanol industry, where ""you are starting to hear of people shutting down.""Historically, the Commodity Credit Corporation only made payments to wheat, corn, soybean and livestock farmers during unexpected drops in crop prices because of surpluses or declines in output related to weather or disease.But the administration has used this program to reimburse farmers for billions in dollars in losses after China stopped buying soybeans and other crops to punish the United States for tariffs Mr. Trump imposed on Chinese products.Mr. Perdue has repeatedly warned farmers not to count on continuing to receive payments from that federal program. But every time funding has been about to run out, Mr. Trump has clamored to spend more.In late February, after the administration reached a new trade agreement with China, for instance, Mr. Perdue said, ""I am not advising any farmer to expect any market program at this point, as the market should adjust for the current trade expectations.""The very next day, Mr. Trump tweeted that if farmers needed more aid while waiting for the terms of new trade deals to kick in, ""that aid will be provided by the federal government.""Although the Agriculture Department is not obligated to use its new spending authority, industry analysts fully expect it will, especially with Election Day a little over seven months away.Brent Gloy, a corn, wheat and soybean farmer and agricultural economist from Nebraska, said, ""Those checks are going to go out.""Kitty Bennett contributed research.Kitty Bennett contributed research.PhotographAs much as $23.5 billion is set aside for farmers, who could be a key for President Trump's re-election bid.

| Jump to first hitThe four-term Maine senator, who crossed party lines to vote against President Clinton's impeachment, must now decide whether to break with President Trump.WASHINGTON -- A few days after Senator Susan Collins cast her votes to acquit President Bill Clinton, as she was greeted with icy stares at a Lincoln Day dinner in rural Maine, a fellow Republican approached her, irate.""I can't believe you let him off the hook,"" he told Ms. Collins. ""I am never, ever voting for you again.""Twenty-one years later, she faces another presidential impeachment vote with heavy consequences for the nation and her own political survival. Ms. Collins, one of a handful of moderate Republicans whose votes could alter the trajectory of the trial, said she does not regret her votes to acquit then.She said she would use the same logic behind that decision when she weighs the impeachment charges against President Trump in a Senate trial that begins in earnest next week.""I, too, was furious at President Clinton and felt that he had lied under oath, but it didn't reach the constitutional test of high crimes and misdemeanors, and was not sufficient to overturn an election and throw him out of office,"" she said in an interview on Thursday in her Capitol Hill office.In the case of Mr. Trump, she said, she would be ""applying that same standard.""Ms. Collins's position as a centrist gives her outsize influence over the shape of Mr. Trump's trial, including whether new witnesses and evidence will be heard, just as it has in some of the most important and impassioned debates during her four terms in the Senate. But that middle ground is shrinking in the Trump era, leaving her open to bitter attack from both political parties.She was among three Republicans who sank Mr. Trump's attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and she helped lead an unsuccessful effort to prevent him from taking unallocated money for his border wall. But she also voted for a tax bill that was the centerpiece of the Republican agenda. And the move that overshadowed all that was her deciding vote to confirm Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual assault.Ms. Collins's health care vote in 2017 fueled hopes on the left and anger on the right over whether she might stray from party orthodoxy. But the Kavanaugh vote and the tax vote reinforced her lifelong party affiliation despite her aversion to parts of Mr. Trump's agenda.That confirmation vote -- and her impassioned speech defending it on the Senate floor -- generated millions of dollars in donations to be used against her, and a lengthy period of harassment and intimidation by critics, including numerous death threats. There were so many hostile calls targeting her that a 25-year-old employee in one of her Maine offices quit. One day, her husband texted Ms. Collins a photo of himself in a hazmat suit; someone had sent a threatening letter to their Maine home -- where protesters gathered eight Sundays in a row -- that claimed to contain ricin.In Washington, a man waited for Ms. Collins in the dark as she parked her car one evening in the pouring rain, then followed her several blocks to her townhouse. A neighbor lamented to her that he hated living next to ""a rape apologist.""""It just made the whole time very unpleasant,"" said Ms. Collins, who faces a steep re-election challenge in November, when she will seek a fifth term. ""But anyone who thinks that they can intimidate me doesn't know me.""Ms. Collins's history, and her competitive race to keep her seat, puts her at the top of the list of senators under scrutiny in the impeachment debate. Reporters on Capitol Hill toil to divine her intentions; as the articles of impeachment were read Thursday on the Senate floor, Ms. Collins, who was suffering a bad cold, coughed and dabbed at her eyes, causing several reporters to call her office to ask why she was crying.Her vote at the conclusion of Mr. Trump's trial almost certainly will not determine whether he becomes the first president to be removed from office by the Senate -- the 67 votes required, at this point, are not there. But Ms. Collins will be pivotal to resolving procedural questions, including a battle between Republicans and Democrats over calling witnesses and admitting new documents as part of the Senate trial. And Ms. Collins has signaled that she will buck her party and support both moves.""I would anticipate that it is likely that I would vote to have more information brought forward, whether witnesses or documents or both,"" she said Thursday.Ms. Collins convened several meetings in her office with the Republican senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee to cobble together a provision ensuring a vote on the matter after opening arguments by both sides and questions from senators. If the four hang together on the issue, their votes would be enough -- along with the 47 that Democrats control -- to demand more information come out in the trial.And her eventual vote on whether to remove the president will be politically significant as well, both to Mr. Trump and to Ms. Collins. Since he was impeached last month, the president has leaned on his party's unified opposition to dismiss the whole effort as a partisan ""hoax,"" and he has made it clear he looks forward to an exoneration by the Republican-led chamber. Even a single Republican vote in favor of removing him would undermine that.In Maine, Ms. Collins's choice could prove even more consequential to voters, and perhaps play a critical role in her legacy.""There is no doubt that there are going to be Mainers unhappy with me no matter what conclusion I reach,"" said Ms. Collins, who said she has been powering through an enormous white binder detailing the trial's substance.The Kavanaugh confirmation, among the most bitter Senate fights of the Trump administration, may have shored up support among a Republican base smarting from some of Ms. Collins's other votes, but it enraged many of the independent and Democratic voters who have helped keep Ms. Collins comfortably in office for years. It also set the stage and tone for the impeachment fight.What appears to rankle Ms. Collins is the suggestion that her votes are mere political calculations. She often says she consults a bevy of experts, reams of transcripts and scores of interviews with people who have a personal stake in a policy outcome.To prepare for Mr. Trump's trial, she met with specialists from the legal division at the Congressional Research Service and had her staff put together a huge notebook about the 1999 trial procedures. She has read myriad transcripts of the House hearings and reports on the Ukraine matter and Mr. Trump, she said.""I felt that the process that we followed in 1999 worked really well and produced a fair outcome,"" she said, including the decision to call witnesses and examine additional evidence, which most Republicans are resisting this time around.In voting for witnesses but rejecting one or both charges against Mr. Trump, Ms. Collins might anticipate she can satisfy both Maine Republicans, many of whom are very loyal to the president, and the many Democrats and independents she has always relied on for her victories.But that is far from clear in such a hyperpartisan environment. And she will be running for re-election against several opponents in November, including Sara Gideon, the Democratic speaker of Maine's House.""I am definitely expecting this to be an all-out brawl from both left and right groups, along with the candidate and party spending,"" said Michael M. Franz, a co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks political advertising spending.Maine's race already surpassed all other Senate races in terms of campaign spending for 2019, Mr. Franz said. ""All told, I don't expect either side to be dramatically outspent, since pro-Democrat groups see this election as one of their likeliest prospects,"" he said.Compromise legislation of the sort that used to help lawmakers in Maine, where voters love independence, is increasingly rare in Congress these days. (A notable exception is the recent North American trade agreement.)Polls show approval ratings for Ms. Collins, long one of the nation's most popular senators, dipping.""Maine has a kind of model of what they want a political figure to look like, which has elements of being respected nationally, civility and a certain degree of bipartisanship and independence,"" said Amy Fried, the chairwoman of the department of political science at the University of Maine. ""However in today's politics she has been pushed out of that.""For example, Ms. Fried said, although Ms. Collins is seen as supportive of abortion rights and pro-environment, political advocacy groups that press for those issues are not likely to support her this year.""Senator Collins is now the most unpopular senator in the country because she's shown over and over again that she will put the needs of corporate special interests and Mitch McConnell ahead of Mainers,"" said Kathleen Marra, the chairwoman of the Maine Democratic Party, who says there has been a tremendous surge in enthusiasm and volunteer engagement in her state.Yet incumbency can be a powerful force. Ms. Collins is known as a shrewd politician who has built ties to every part of the state and labors to scrape together benefits for its shipyards, lobstermen and large elderly population and to promote them when at home.Impeachment could be a wild card.""I feel confident she is beatable, but don't feel confident she will definitely lose yet,"" said Brian Fallon, the executive director of Demand Justice, one of the many groups spending millions of dollars to highlight Ms. Collins's Kavanaugh vote. ""It is still going to take a lot of work.""PhotographSenator Susan Collins said she would use the ""same standard"" she followed in the 1999 trial.

| Jump to first hitAttendees of the bash for Kimberly Guilfoyle at the president's private club chipped in -- including financial backers of the Trump re-election campaign.WASHINGTON -- It was a lavish birthday party for Donald Trump Jr.'s girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle. The setting was Mar-a-Lago, President Trump's private club in Palm Beach, Fla. The guest list included dozens of Trump family members and friends.But when it came to picking up the tab, hands went out to other attendees. Among them were at least four whose families are financial supporters of the president's re-election campaign, for which Ms. Guilfoyle helps lead the fund-raising. They ended up pitching in tens of thousands of dollars, passed along to Mar-a-Lago, to help pay for what two people familiar with the planning said was a $50,000 celebration of Ms. Guilfoyle's 51st birthday.The hourslong bash on the evening of March 7 has since emerged as a snapshot of the cavalier way Mr. Trump and his team initially handled the coronavirus outbreak. At least one attendee -- a Brazilian government official who stopped by the party briefly -- has tested positive for the virus, while another -- Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida -- self-quarantined, though he later announced he had tested negative for the virus.But the funding provided for the party by Mr. Trump's supporters, which has not been previously reported, also underscored other characteristics that have defined his political career: His reliance on other people's money rather than his own fortune, and the overlap between the president's private and public roles.Brendan Fischer, an official at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan watchdog group, called the party ""an illustration of the blurred lines between Trump's presidency, his campaign, and his family's personal and financial interests.""At the very least, he said, the party created the appearance of supporters of the president currying favor with his family by steering money into his private business, which he continues to profit from.""This may not be illegal, but it is incredibly unethical,"" he said.Even some in Mr. Trump's orbit worried that it would look unsavory to accept money from political donors for the celebration at a time when coronavirus fears were spreading, according to people familiar with the concerns.The party was organized with the assistance of Caroline Wren, a veteran Republican fund-raiser who sent out invitations and gave a speech at the party thanking attendees who chipped in, according to people familiar with the planning.Ms. Wren is a finance consultant to an arm of Mr. Trump's re-election apparatus called Trump Victory, for which Ms. Guilfoyle is the chairwoman of the finance committee. Trump Victory is a joint fund-raising committee formed by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, and is Mr. Trump's primary means of raising six-figure campaign donations.The committee was hosting major donors at a spring retreat in Palm Beach the same weekend as the party, drawing many of Mr. Trump's top financial backers to the area for events, including some at Mar-a-Lago. Ms. Guilfoyle's birthday party became a coveted ticket for donors.Ms. Wren said in a statement that she had been friends with Ms. Guilfoyle for several years and ""volunteered to assist Kimberly during her birthday party celebrations.""""This was not a campaign event, nor an R.N.C. event,"" she continued, ""and anything I assisted with was in my private and personal capacity.""Michael Ahrens, a spokesman for the R.N.C., said that the party committee and Trump Victory ""were not involved in the organization or financing"" of Ms. Guilfoyle's party.The White House declined to comment on the party, and why the president did not pay for it himself.The chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, who spent time at Mar-a-Lago during the retreat but did not attend the birthday party, fell ill after the weekend, as did a fund-raiser who works with Ms. Guilfoyle. Both are awaiting results of tests for the coronavirus.The birthday party had the feel of a Trump campaign event, according to attendees. The invitees included a panoply of administration officials, campaign figures, political allies and major donors to Trump Victory, many of them both personal and professional friends to Ms. Guilfoyle.Ivanka Trump thanked Ms. Guilfoyle for working ""so, so hard for the president,"" a video of the event showed. After the president joined the crowd in singing happy birthday to Ms. Guilfoyle, she chanted, ""Four more years!""And Donald Trump Jr. reportedly joked that Ms. Guilfoyle would be soliciting contributions for his father's re-election from party attendees.""You are in this room for a reason,"" he said, according to The Washington Examiner. ""You guys have been the warriors, the fighters, the people who have been there every time we have made a call, every time we made a request.""The money given to pay for the party went to Mar-a-Lago, though it is unclear if each donor individually paid the club, or if the money was pooled and paid to the club by a member, who could put the expenses on an account. Donald Trump Jr. and another attendee, John W. Giordano, a lawyer and Republican donor, are members of the club. People involved in the planning said the attendees were not solicited as part of an organized fund-raising effort.Ms. Guilfoyle declined to answer detailed questions about the party, including who facilitated the contributions. In an email, a spokeswoman for Ms. Guilfoyle said: ""All of the people who offered to support this evening have been longtime friends of Kimberly's. None of them have to donate to see her.""But one of the donors, Madhavan Padmakumar, an information technology executive from New York, said he had never met Ms. Guilfoyle. Mr. Padmakumar traveled to Palm Beach as part of a delegation of Indian-Americans attending the Republican Party donor retreat.Mr. Padmakumar said he attended Ms. Guilfoyle's party with a leader of the Indian-American delegation, Al Mason, a real estate investor and Trump fund-raiser who is friendly with Ms. Guilfoyle. Mr. Padmakumar agreed to pay $10,000 to help fund the celebration because ""I was keen to have my name promoted,"" he said in the text message. He noted that he was ""announced"" as one of the ""sponsors of the party.""He also said he donated to Mr. Trump's campaign at the retreat.Mr. Padmakumar, who had never visited Mar-a-Lago, said he ""always wanted to go and see"" it, and recalled seeing the president and his family ""all cut the cake.""Others who contributed funds for the party were longer-term supporters of Mr. Trump's campaign.They included the New York supermarket billionaire John A. Catsimatidis, who chipped in $10,000, according to people familiar with the arrangement. His daughter Andrea Catsimatidis, a longtime friend of Ms. Guilfoyle's, attended the party.In a statement, Mr. Catsimatidis described his donation as strictly motivated by a two-decade friendship with Ms. Guilfoyle. ""I am always happy to support my friends,"" he said.Another contributor to the festivities was Catharine P. O'Neill, whose father is a major Trump donor. She worked as a staff assistant in the State Department after Mr. Trump took office and became a fixture in Washington's pro-Trump social scene.Also helping to finance the celebration was Mr. Giordano, who had advised Mr. Trump's campaign and transition and had been rumored to be in contention for a position in his administration as a United States attorney. He is a partner in the government-affairs division of Archer, a Philadelphia-area law firm with a substantial lobbying business.The key question in determining whether the arrangement crossed legal lines, said Mr. Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center, could be whether the attendees who contributed to the party would have done so even if Mr. Trump were not the president running for re-election.He said that if the donors gave only because Mr. Trump is a candidate, then ""there could be an argument that they made contributions to Trump's campaign,"" which would need to be reported to the Federal Election Commission.Another attendee who is friendly with Ms. Guilfoyle asked the head of a Miami marketing and advertising agency to provide liquor for an after-party. The marketing executive turned to a Florida tequila company, Don Sueños, which sent over two cases for Ms. Guilfoyle's party.It was ""just to get our name out there,"" said Tre Zimmerman, whose wife is the company's owner. ""I don't know Kimberly.""Not all the attendees were asked to contribute, said Doug Deason, a Dallas businessman and Trump donor. Mr. Deason was invited by Ms. Guilfoyle after they chatted at the Trump International Hotel in Washington a week earlier.""I was not asked to sponsor her birthday party and I don't know of anyone who was,"" Mr. Deason said in a text message.Mr. Deason said he and his wife were seated at a table ""right behind the head table,"" but left before ""the dancing.""A video shows partygoers forming a ""Trump Train"" conga line to the song ""Rhythm Is Gonna Get You,"" by Gloria Estefan.Kenneth P. Vogel reported from Washington, and Steve Eder and Nicholas Confessore from New York. Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York. Susan Beachy contributed research.PhotographDonald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle at Mar-a-Lago on Christmas Eve.

| Jump to first hitThe president, addressing supporters in Ohio, said that he had killed a ""bloodthirsty terror"" and slammed Democrats for seeking to restrain his power to make war.TOLEDO, Ohio -- President Trump opened his re-election year in the Midwest on Thursday, hoping to translate his confrontation with Iran into strength on the campaign trail as he boasted about killing the head of its elite security forces and derided Democrats for seeking to restrain his power to go to war.For his first campaign rally of 2020, Mr. Trump returned to Ohio, where he has devoted much of his travel over the past three years to cement support that will be crucial to rebuilding the unlikely Electoral College coalition he assembled in 2016. But job growth has stalled in the state, and Democrats accused him of failing to live up to his promise of restoring manufacturing in the region.Standing in front of a giant American flag, the president celebrated his decision to order a drone strike killing the Iranian commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, calling him ""the world's top terrorist"" and insisting that he was planning to attack American embassies despite doubts about the intelligence. ""He was a bad guy,"" Mr. Trump told a cheering crowd at the Huntington Center, a minor-league hockey arena. ""He was a bloodthirsty terror and he's no longer a terror. He's dead.""Hours after House Democrats passed a resolution intended to limit Mr. Trump's ability to wage war without congressional permission, the president said Speaker Nancy Pelosi had her priorities wrong.""I see the radical left Democrats have expressed outrage over the termination of this horrible terrorist,"" he said. ""And you know, instead, they should be outraged by Suleimani's savage crimes.""At the mention of Ms. Pelosi, who he said is ""not operating with a full deck,"" some in the crowd shouted: ""Lock her up! Lock her up!""Mr. Trump also singled out Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, offering a parody version of the congressman supposedly preferring to talk about taking out a terrorist instead of actually doing so. ""You little pencil neck,"" Mr. Trump then said derisively, as if addressing Mr. Schiff.He made no mention of his decision to back away from further military action after Iran's missile strikes on Iraqi bases housing American troops, which resulted in no casualties. Nor did he mention the Ukrainian civilian airliner that Western intelligence agencies concluded was shot down by Iranian missiles, most likely by mistake.The crowd was broadly supportive of his tough talk on Iran and Democrats. But several demonstrators disrupted the president's speech, holding up hand-drawn signs saying ""NO WAR"" before being evicted by security officers.Democratic leaders have said they agree that General Suleimani had American blood on his hands and do not mourn his death. But they have accused Mr. Trump of approving a reckless action on flimsy claims that risked a wider war with Iran and undermined American interests in the region by alienating allies like Iraq.""This week, you put our sons and daughters in harm's way when you abandoned diplomacy, rejected our allies, and escalated conflict in the Middle East and around the world,"" Representative Marcy Kaptur, the longtime Democratic congresswoman from Toledo, wrote Mr. Trump in an open letter posted on her website before the rally. ""It causes one to wonder if anyone from the Trump family has ever served in the U.S. military or in a foreign war.Mr. Trump's trip to Ohio was the 15th of his presidency. Awaiting him was Vice President Mike Pence and an arena full of enthusiastic supporters, many decked out in classic red ""Make America Great Again"" baseball caps and waving ""Keep America Great"" placards. Outside the arena were smaller but energized crowds of protesters, many of them waving union signs or handmade banners, like ""Dump Trump.""It was a typical Trump performance, rambling and disjointed, loose and entertaining, full of invective for his enemies and the news media, peppered with false and misleading assertions and soaked in by the appreciative crowd. In the best-hits portion of the evening, he revisited the 2016 election, as he likes to do, quoting himself, as he also likes to do, as well as anyone else who ever said anything positive about him, whether they actually did or not.At one point, he said that he was viewed more positively by Republicans in one poll than Abraham Lincoln.""Who do you like better, Trump or Abraham Lincoln?"" he said, recalling the survey question. Some in the crowd shouted out their answer: ""Trump! Trump!"" although many others did not join in, perhaps quiet Lincoln admirers.Mr. Trump said he shared the result of the poll with his wife, addressing her by her title. ""I said, 'First Lady, I just beat Abraham Lincoln in a poll,""' he said.At another point, the president began riffing about the various Democrats running against him before lamenting that they were boring. Watching them, he said, ""is like watching death."" Which might explain why he spent time recycling some of his favorite attacks on former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas, who is no longer even in the race.Toward the end, after an extended attack on Democrats as corrupt, crime-loving socialists who are ""stone-cold crazy,"" Mr. Trump suddenly stopped and reflected on his own language. ""Gee,"" he said, ""now I sort of understand why they hate me.""Mr. Trump won Ohio by eight percentage points in 2016, and the state has been the bedrock of every winning Republican presidential candidate going back to the 19th century. Polling in Ohio last fall showed Mr. Trump trailing some of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates in hypothetical matchups, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont by six percentage points and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts by four points, but there has been little recent independent public surveying in the state.In few places will the economic argument be as important for Mr. Trump's chances of winning a second term as in the Midwest, where he vowed to rebuild a manufacturing industry that has struggled in recent decades.""The betrayal of Ohio workers and American workers ended the day I took the oath of office,"" he said, citing his revised version of the North American Free Trade Agreement and his trade war with China. ""Ohio just had the best year economically in the history of your state,"" he claimed at another point, ""and this year is going to be even better, maybe much better.""In fact, unemployment in Ohio fell from a high of 11.1 percent in 2010 to 4.9 percent under President Barack Obama. After Mr. Trump took over, it continued to fall to 4.0 percent by last summer, although in recent months it ticked back up to 4.2 percent. It remains higher than the national rate and among the 10 states with the highest in the country. The state lost 4,400 jobs last year through November and shed 2,200 manufacturing jobs over the previous year.Ohio Democrats welcomed the president to the state by attacking his ""failed policies,"" like the ""trade war by tweet,"" as David Pepper, the state party chairman, put it. ""Donald Trump has broken his promises on jobs, on trade, on health care, on education and on so much more,"" Mr. Pepper told reporters.Mr. Trump will ramp up campaign travel as the year progresses and Democrats begin voting to choose their nominee. He has rallies scheduled in the next few weeks in Milwaukee, to build support in another key Midwest battleground, and Wildwood, N.J., to campaign with Representative Jeff Van Drew, who left the Democratic Party over impeachment.PhotographAt a campaign rally in Toledo, Ohio, on Thursday night, President Trump painted Democrats as sympathetic to terrorists.

| Jump to first hitThe president will stay in Las Vegas this week as Democratic candidates debate down the Strip. His namesake hotel is abuzz with Secret Service agents, supporters and the simply curious.LAS VEGAS -- When Elaine and Robert Jacobs of Mansfield, Ohio, checked in for their three-night time-share vacation on Monday, the receptionist told them to expect tight security.""We asked why,"" Ms. Jacobs said. ""And we heard, 'Well, the president's coming.""'The Trump International Hotel, which hosts Hilton time-shares, is a glassy, golden high-rise at the north edge of the Las Vegas Strip. Starting Tuesday, it will host President Trump for three nights, just as the leading Democratic presidential candidates debate on Wednesday at another hotel less than two miles away, and the Nevada Democratic Party prepares to caucus on Saturday to select a nominee.Mr. Trump, who has declined to spend the night in other early-voting states he is visiting, is scheduled to hold a campaign event of his own at the Las Vegas Convention Center on Friday afternoon.Preparing for Mr. Trump's arrival, his namesake hotel was abuzz on Monday, with federal law enforcement officers surveying the property; Trump supporters eyeing branded dog toys in the gift shop; and hotel staff members tossing pristine-looking bouquets of red amaryllis into trash bags and replacing them with new buds.Carl and Sara Shupe were visiting Las Vegas from Minnesota to renew their wedding vows. Mr. Shupe had packed a gray ""Trump-Pence"" T-shirt, which he wore Monday while taking in the hotel lobby. ""He always travels with Trump,"" Mrs. Shupe joked, gesturing at his shirt, though her husband added that he couldn't wear it in front of his mother-in-law, who disapproved of the president.""I hope the Democrats' best candidate comes forward and we get a race,"" said Mr. Shupe, an Army veteran who owns a construction business. He had voted for Barack Obama, he said, but had been disappointed. ""The reason I voted for Trump is because I want people out of Washington, Republicans and Democrats alike. I want term limits. I want to make sure we just kind of flush the toilet and start over.""Fox News and Fox Business played on two of the oversize televisions in the ""DJT"" restaurant set within the lobby -- a diminutive lobby by Las Vegas standards, but punctuated by ornate chandeliers and three columns of hanging crystals. Restaurant guests scanned menus featuring Trump wines and cocktails like ""The Smoking Old-Fashioned Billionaire,"" with rye whiskey, and ""Death by Trial,"" a rum drink with citrus.Mr. Trump's hotels have had mixed performance since his election, with some like the Trump National Doral near Miami showing significant declines in revenue since 2015 -- in part because some customers and corporate sponsors have avoided the resort, as Mr. Trump himself has acknowledged. Other Trump-branded hotels, in Panama City, Toronto and the SoHo neighborhood of New York, have dropped the Trump brand, after protests by owners or other friction.But the Las Vegas hotel has been among the better performers in the Trump portfolio, bringing in more than $30 million a year from hotel and condo sales that have been fairly steady since Mr. Trump was elected.Ty Wilfon, a firefighter from Albuquerque, browsed the Trump store with his wife and sons, who inspected chocolates made to look like bars of gold and stamped with the president's name. A dozen miniature ones cost $21.The Wilfons had just sold a house and were visiting Las Vegas to celebrate. ""I'm obviously a Donald Trump supporter,"" Mr. Wilfon said, as he looked for ties in the shop but couldn't justify the $125 asking price. ""With the whole impeachment thing, it makes me support Trump more,"" he said, calling the 2020 race ""pretty crazy"" and adding he thought Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii was the Democrats' strongest candidate.Beckey and Ricky Langley, small-business owners from Washington State, had ducked into the hotel to see the scene. They called themselves moderates who had been hesitant to vote for Mr. Trump in 2016 but were won over by how the economy had performed in his first term, helping their storm-drain-cleaning business boom and making them enthusiastic about his re-election bid.""Right now, I think I do identify with the Republican Party, but I think it's more because of what the opposition shows,"" Ms. Langley said, calling Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota the only acceptable candidate in the primary race.""The Democrats are just imploding,"" Mr. Langley said. ""They've gone so far left, so far overboard.""One restaurant server tending to tables in the lobby said she had already voted in the Democratic caucus. Four hotels along the Strip had converted employee dining areas into pop-up early-voting sites over the holiday weekend. One hotel, the Bellagio, offered 24-hour voting that wound down on Monday.With 1,282 rooms, the Trump hotel was offering a range of accommodations for the night of the president's arrival Tuesday, with rooms starting at $140, according to its website. Some third-party booking sites touted even better deals. ""The exterior windows are, of course, gilded in glistening 24-carat gold,"" the booking app HotelTonight said, offering a rate of $101. ""Lack of casino creates a more peaceful Vegas experience.""Some guests didn't find the prospect of a presidential entourage so peaceful. ""I can't talk about it because I'm going to get too upset,"" one woman said, declining to say anything more.""He's the president, and he is to be respected no matter what,"" another guest said, declining to give her name. ""But we're not Trump supporters,"" the man she was with called over his shoulder as they walked away.The Jacobses from Ohio said they liked the Trump hotel for its large rooms and quieter location, even if they were not fans of Mr. Trump himself. ""If it didn't say Trump, I'd be thrilled,"" Ms. Jacobs said, pointing to the hotel sign.""He's a little crazy,"" Mr. Jacobs said. ""But we have 401(k)'s,"" he said, calling Mr. Trump good for the economy and adding that the couple liked the two former mayors in the race -- Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Michael R. Bloomberg of New York -- best of the Democratic contenders.Aaron Chuang, who manages a car dealership in Toronto and was visiting Las Vegas for a conference, called his decision to stay at the Trump hotel this week one of pure economics. ""I used my uncle's free Hilton points,"" Mr. Chuang said, adding about Mr. Trump: ""I wouldn't stay here otherwise. I don't like him.""For others, the opportunity to stay at the hotel along with the president was cause for celebration. Joseph Mazza, who flew in from Boston with two friends for his 30th birthday, checked in Monday afternoon. Mr. Mazza, who works in finance, said he had attended Mr. Trump's rally in New Hampshire this month, and he praised his deregulation efforts and corporate tax cuts. ""I'm a big fan,"" he said.PhotographPresident Trump will be staying at his hotel in Las Vegas this week, while Democrats have a debate at the Paris Theater on Wednesday.

| Jump to first hitWASHINGTON -- ""Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye. All persons are commanded to keep silent upon pain of imprisonment.""Those words, an echo of another time, came from Michael C. Stenger, the Senate sergeant-at-arms, and fell upon a hushed Senate chamber just after noon on Thursday. The impeachment trial of Donald John Trump, the 45th president of the United States, on charges of high crimes and misdemeanors was about to begin.Two hours later, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., in flowing black robes, escorted by four senators, strode into the room to open the third presidential impeachment trial in American history.""When the chief justice walked in, you could feel the weight of the moment,"" Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said later. ""I saw members on both sides of the aisle visibly gulp.""Chief Justice Roberts, who will preside over the trial, was sworn in by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the Senate pro tempore -- a post he holds because he is the longest-serving member of the majority.Mr. Grassley administered the oath, which dates to the 1700s: ""I solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John Trump, president of the United States, now pending, I will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws: So help me God.""Chief Justice Roberts then administered the same oath to the senators, who rose in unison, raised their right hands and swore to administer ""impartial justice.""One by one, in alphabetical order, the senators then proceeded to the well of the chamber to sign an ""oath book"" -- an affirmation in writing of the vow they had just taken.In a proceeding laden with history and tradition, the oath book is a relatively recent convention; it dates to 1986, when the Senate updated its impeachment rules for the television era.Earlier in the day, the seven Democrats appointed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi as ""impeachment managers"" to prosecute the House's case walked two-by-two across the Capitol to the Senate chamber. They had already delivered two articles of impeachment, one on abuse of power and the other on obstruction of Congress, to the Senate on Wednesday evening. Now they were invited to ""exhibit"" -- or read them aloud -- in the chamber at noon on Thursday.Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the lead impeachment manager, delivered the formal accusation from the House: President Trump had committed ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" by withholding military aid from Ukraine to help himself win the 2020 election, and then concealed his actions from Congress.""President Trump,"" Mr. Schiff said, ""warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States.""There were signs all over the Capitol that this was a different kind of day.The Capitol Police officers, who have the option to wear turtlenecks, wore ties with their dress blue uniforms. Areas ordinarily open to the news media and visitors were cordoned off with golden stanchions and crimson velvet ropes. Reporters and staff members were issued special color-coded badges -- maroon for the news media, brown for Senate staff -- to gain entry to the Senate side of the Capitol.The highly orchestrated rituals of the impeachment trial began on Wednesday, when the House voted, largely along party lines, to transmit the articles to the Senate and appoint the impeachment managers.Ms. Pelosi needed to sign them, and she did so during a formal ""engrossment ceremony,"" using more than a dozen black and gold pens that were laid out on silver trays. (Later she gave the pens as mementos to committee leaders and other Democrats who played a role in the House impeachment inquiry.)Mr. Schiff and his team then walked slowly in a procession through the Capitol, through Statuary Hall and the Rotunda, to deliver the articles to the Senate.Mr. Trump's trial will reconvene at 1 p.m. Tuesday. On his way out of the Capitol, Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, reflected on what was going through his mind as the chief justice administered the oath.""The gravity of what we are undertaking, I think, is sinking in for all of us,"" he said.PhotographChief Justice John G.

| Jump to first hitPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel returns this week to the White House, where President Trump is expected to lay out the details of a plan that is three years in the making.LONDON -- Less than a month after being sworn in, President Trump welcomed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to the White House with a bold promise: He would broker a peace accord between the Israelis and the Palestinians -- the diplomatic unicorn that had eluded half a dozen of his predecessors.""I think we're going to make a deal,"" he said in 2017. ""It might be a bigger and better deal than people in this room even understand.""""As with any successful negotiation,"" Mr. Trump continued, ""both sides will have to make compromises. You know that, right?"" he added, turning to his guest.Mr. Netanyahu grinned. ""Both sides,"" he replied.The Israeli leader will return to the White House for meetings Monday and Tuesday, and Mr. Trump is expected at last to lay out the details of that long-awaited plan. Mr. Netanyahu said Sunday he hoped to ""make history"" on the visit.But far from a bold effort to bring old enemies together -- one that demands painful concessions from both sides -- Middle East experts now expect the plan to be mainly a booster shot for Mr. Netanyahu's desperate campaign to stay in power.Benny Gantz, again Mr. Netanyahu's rival in Israel's third election in less than a year, will have his own separate meeting with Mr. Trump on Monday. He had at first resisted the invitation, fearing a political trap in which Mr. Netanyahu would get to play the statesman while Mr. Gantz would look puny by comparison. But analysts said he could not afford to snub the president, given Mr. Trump's enduring popularity in Israel.The Palestinians, who stopped talking to Mr. Trump after he ordered the United States Embassy to be moved to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv in December 2017, will not be at the White House to be briefed on the plan. They have vowed to reject it.""For him to do this in the middle of an Israeli election, without any Palestinian participation and with no intention to follow up with any of the participants, shows this is not a peace plan at all,"" said Martin S. Indyk, who served as special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations under President Barack Obama.""It is a farce from start to finish,"" he said.Mr. Indyk's verdict is harsh but not uncommon among diplomats who have worked on past peace efforts. Like other veterans of those fruitless negotiations, in both Democratic and Republican administrations, Mr. Indyk watched the early days of Mr. Trump's diplomacy with fascination and even muted hope -- that this most undiplomatic of presidents might achieve a breakthrough where they had failed.That triumph of hope over experience was shared by some in the region. Palestinians and Israelis took to calling it Mr. Trump's ""deal of the century,"" outdoing his own description of it as the ""ultimate deal.""The president brought a deal maker's swagger and a property developer's instincts to a problem that, after all, involves disputed territory. His close ties to Mr. Netanyahu -- something Mr. Obama lacked -- raised hopes that he might be able to extract real concessions from Israel. In a sign of the importance Mr. Trump attached to the effort, he put his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in charge of it.Mr. Kushner led a team that included Jason D. Greenblatt, the Trump Organization's former chief lawyer, and David M. Friedman, a bankruptcy lawyer with ties to the Jewish settler movement who became Mr. Trump's ambassador to Israel. He would emerge as the most influential adviser to Mr. Trump on Israel.For months, Mr. Kushner and Mr. Greenblatt traveled around the Middle East, meeting with Arab leaders in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and other nations. Their strategy, known as ""outside-in,"" was designed to build a coalition of Arab support for a peace plan. The Arab leaders, the White House hoped, would pressure the Palestinian Authority to accept whatever Mr. Trump offered.Mr. Kushner devoted particular attention to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, with whom he had cultivated a friendship of like-minded scions. Prince Mohammed expressed a willingness to establish relations with Israel and said the Israelis ""have the right to have their own land.""At home, Mr. Trump's pro-Israel supporters were growing restive. They worried that he might put too much pressure on Mr. Netanyahu. Mr. Trump told him that a rapid expansion of settlements was not conducive to an agreement. After meeting with Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, in May 2017, Mr. Trump said that it was an ""honor"" -- a post that later vanished from his Twitter feed.Any such worries, however, were laid to rest seven months later when Mr. Trump announced he would move the embassy, formally recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The move delighted evangelicals, as well as pro-Israel donors like Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate.But it drove away the Palestinians, who cut off contact with the White House, and doomed the White House's efforts to build Arab support for its plan. King Salman of Saudi Arabia was among those who condemned the decision, declaring, ""East Jerusalem is an integral part of the Palestinian territories.""Mr. Trump reacted harshly to the Palestinian rejection. He punished them by cutting off hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the Palestinian Authority, as well as funding for the United Nations agency that helps Palestinian refugees.The State Department shut down the office of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Washington. It downgraded the American consulate in Jerusalem, which had been a key channel to the Palestinians, by merging it with the embassy under Mr. Friedman, who later said Israel had the right to annex parts of the West Bank.Even as the rift with the Palestinians widened, Mr. Kushner and Mr. Greenblatt labored on their plan. Working under a veil of secrecy, they compiled a multipage document, with annexes, that officials said would propose solutions to all the key disputes: borders, security, refugees and the status of Jerusalem.While the plan never leaked -- a rarity in the sievelike world of Middle East diplomacy -- its general contours became known. It is not expected to call for a two-state solution or give East Jerusalem to the Palestinians. Nor will it offer Palestinian refugees a right of return or other compensation.Mr. Kushner and Mr. Greenblatt, who has since left the administration, predicted in March 2018 that the Israelis and the Palestinians would each find things in the plan to embrace and oppose. But it was already clear that it would be tilted heavily in Israel's favor -- or more precisely, in the favor of their embattled ally, Mr. Netanyahu.Facing indictment on multiple corruption charges in early 2019, the prime minister was fighting for his political life. With Mr. Netanyahu facing a closely fought election that April, Mr. Trump gave him an election-eve gift, announcing in March that the United States would reverse decades of policy and recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which was seized by Israeli troops in 1967.With the release of his plan stymied by the instability in Israel, Mr. Kushner turned his attention to economics. In June, he announced the United States would raise more than $50 billion to improve the lives of the Palestinians and their Arab neighbors. His 38-page plan, titled ""Peace to Prosperity,"" had slick graphics and the promotional tone of a real estate prospectus.Mr. Kushner followed up with a two-day workshop in Bahrain, which was boycotted by the Palestinians and shrugged off by other Arab leaders, for whom the peace project had faded into irrelevance.Even after Mr. Trump's shift on the Golan Heights, Mr. Netanyahu was unable to cobble together a majority to form a government. After a second election, in September, he found himself again short of a majority.If Mr. Trump releases his plan this week, analysts said, it will be less about delivering the ""deal of the century"" than giving Mr. Netanyahu one last electoral lift.PhotographPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, left, with Jared Kushner.

| Jump to first hitThe president dismissed criticism that the Justice Department had acted inappropriately in overruling the recommendation of its own prosecutors in the case of his longtime friend.WASHINGTON -- President Trump congratulated Attorney General William P. Barr on Wednesday for intervening to lower the Justice Department's sentencing recommendation for the president's longtime friend Roger J. Stone Jr., calling his prosecution ""a disgrace"" for which he deserves an apology.In sharply worded tweets and comments to reporters, Mr. Trump dismissed criticism that the Justice Department was abandoning its traditional independence by responding to his unhappiness with the recommendation that Mr. Stone serve up to nine years in prison for obstructing a congressional inquiry.""Congratulations to Attorney General Bill Barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought,"" Mr. Trump tweeted. He compared the Stone case to the Russia investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel.""Evidence now clearly shows that the Mueller Scam was improperly brought & tainted. Even Bob Mueller lied to Congress!"" Mr. Trump said, though he did not explain the accusation against Mr. Mueller, a former F.B.I. director.Mr. Trump's comments came less than 24 hours after four career prosecutors withdrew from the Stone case after senior officials at the department overruled the seven- to nine-year term they had recommended Mr. Stone receive. One of the prosecutors also resigned from the Justice Department, where he worked in the public integrity section.The reaction by the prosecutors and the president's subsequent comments roiled Washington for a second day as Democratic lawmakers, former law enforcement officials and ethics watchdog groups accused Mr. Trump of abusing the power of his office to influence the Justice Department in a continuing criminal case.Eric H. Holder Jr., who served as attorney general under President Barack Obama, called the situation ""unprecedented."" Walter M. Shaub Jr., the former director of the Office of Government Ethics, likened Tuesday's actions by Mr. Trump and the Justice Department to those in countries with authoritarian regimes.""A corrupt authoritarian and his henchmen are wielding the Justice Department as a shield for friends and a sword for political rivals,"" Mr. Shaub said Wednesday in a Twitter post. ""It is impossible to overstate the danger.""Mr. Stone was convicted in November of obstructing the House Intelligence Committee's examination of Russian interference in the 2016 election by lying to investigators under oath and trying to block the testimony of a witness who would have exposed his lies.The initial sentencing recommendation for Mr. Stone was filed late Monday. On Tuesday, it was amended and refiled stating that the earlier version ""did not accurately reflect the Department of Justice's position on what would be a reasonable sentence in this matter."" The department instead suggested an unspecified term.The department's action followed a Fox News report on the recommendation and a Twitter post by Mr. Trump, who said: ""This is a horrible and very unfair situation. The real crimes were on the other side, as nothing happens to them. Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!""The decision to override the recommended sentence was made by officials from the offices of Mr. Barr and the deputy attorney general. The Justice Department said on Tuesday that the case was not discussed with anyone at the White House.Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office before meeting with President Lenín Moreno of Ecuador on Wednesday, Mr. Trump denied that his tweet about Mr. Barr was political and called the prosecution of Mr. Stone ""a disgrace.""Asked whether he would pardon Mr. Stone, the president said, ""I don't want to say that yet, but I tell you what: People were hurt viciously and badly by these corrupt people.""He added that it was unfair that prosecutors recommended that Mr. Stone be sentenced to nine years in prison when James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, has not been jailed. He said that prosecutors ""ought to apologize to him.""""You have murderers and drug addicts that don't get nine years,"" the president said. ""Nine years for doing something that no one can even define what he did.""""In the meantime, Comey walks around making book deals,"" Mr. Trump lamented.Presidents have typically avoided interfering in Justice Department decisions to avoid allegations of improper influence, though there is no law against it. Mr. Trump has publicly inserted himself into several department matters, in some instances to protect friends like Mr. Stone and to direct investigations into his political rivals.The president has also demanded loyalty from his subordinates and has repeatedly praised Mr. Barr's leadership of the department.But the unusual step of overruling the decisions of career prosecutors, particularly in such a politically charged case, reinforced concerns by Democrats and others that Mr. Trump was tipping the scales of justice in favor of his interests.""I do not take a position on the proper prison term for Mr. Stone, but it would be a blatant abuse of power if President Trump has in fact intervened to reverse the recommendations of career prosecutors at the Department of Justice,"" said Representative Adam B. Schiff, a California Democrat who led the House's impeachment of the president.Mr. Schiff is also the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, which Mr. Stone was convicted of obstructing.Mr. Holder said in a Twitter post just after midnight on Wednesday, ""This affects the rule of law and respect for it.""""Do not underestimate the danger of this situation: the political appointees in the DOJ are involving themselves in an inappropriate way in cases involving political allies of the President,"" he added.Nicholas Fandos and Catie Edmondson contributed reporting.PhotographRoger Stone was convicted of lying to investigators under oath in an inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

| Jump to first hitAn argument by one of the president's lawyers, Alan M. Dershowitz, prompted a backlash. He said he was misinterpreted.WASHINGTON -- When a lawyer for President Trump suggested to senators this week that whatever a president does in pursuit of re-election is inherently in the public's interest, the moment crystallized fears among some of Mr. Trump's critics about creeping presidential autocracy.""If a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment,"" said the lawyer, Alan M. Dershowitz. He sought on Thursday to clarify or walk back his remarks, saying on Twitter that they were mischaracterized.But the wave of outrage underscored how the politics of the Trump era -- and his lawyers' efforts to help Mr. Trump advance his agenda and defend himself from scrutiny -- have become infused with concerns about executive power overreach.The constitutional system is built on the idea that each of the three branches of government depends upon and is accountable to the others, said Peter Shane, an Ohio State University law professor and co-author of a separation-of-powers casebook, but an accumulating pattern of claims and actions by the Trump administration has called that into doubt.""What is scary about Trump's view of executive power is that he tries to do as much as he can without the sanction of Congress, and to resist oversight by the other branches,"" Mr. Shane said. ""Put all that together and you get a picture of an executive branch in which all activity is subject to the whim of the president, and how that whim is exercised cannot be effectively checked.""The list of ways in which Mr. Trump and his legal team have pushed limits is growing.In the Ukraine affair, his lawyers have argued that nothing is impeachable or illegal about using his official powers to coerce a weak ally to announce a corruption investigation into a domestic political rival, and the Senate's Republican majority will likely vote to acquit him.Along the way, Mr. Trump's legal team came up with a theory by which the executive branch could lawfully withhold from Congress a whistle-blower complaint that an inspector general had deemed an ""urgent concern."" A law says that the administration ""shall"" disclose such a complaint to lawmakers.And before the Ukraine affair came to light, lawyers in the White House budget office developed a legal theory that Mr. Trump had constitutional authority to withhold congressionally mandated military aid from Ukraine, overriding the Anti-Impoundment Act. They never activated that theory, since he released the aid after the whistle-blower filed his complaint.The president's edgy views of executive power did not start with Ukraine. Mr. Trump himself has repeatedly claimed that Article II of the Constitution, which creates the presidency, gives him ""the right to do whatever I want.""He has said he could pardon himself and vowed to systematically stonewall ""all"" congressional subpoenas.Mr. Trump broke with a long-held norm by personally ordering an investigation into the Russia investigators, and he repeatedly tried to impede the special counsel inquiry, boasting that he has ""an absolute right to do what I want to with the Justice Department.""After William P. Barr, a longtime believer in a maximalist interpretation of presidential power, privately provided the Trump administration with a legal theory by which obstruction of justice laws do not apply to presidents who abuse their power over the Justice Department, Mr. Trump appointed him attorney general.In domestic policy, Mr. Trump has pushed the limits of emergency powers laws to claim a right to spend more taxpayer money on a border wall with Mexico than Congress was willing to appropriate. In foreign policy, he launched strikes at the Syrian government without permission from Congress, and nearly brought the country to war with Iran by killing a senior Iranian general without consulting lawmakers.Against the backdrop of all this and more, critics of Mr. Trump seized on Mr. Dershowitz's remarks. The leader of the House impeachment managers, Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, told the Senate on Thursday that Mr. Trump's team had embraced the vision of a presidency that exists above the law -- ""when the president does it, that means it is not illegal"" -- that Richard Nixon famously articulated to defend his conduct after Watergate.""We are right back to where we were a half-century ago -- and I would argue we may be in a worse place because this time, this time that argument may succeed,"" Mr. Schiff said, accusing Trump defenders of embracing ""the normalization of lawlessness"" by a president.Mr. Dershowitz did not attend the impeachment trial on Thursday, but another member of the president's defense team, Patrick Philbin, also distanced himself from the impression Mr. Dershowitz had left. At one point he invoked something else Mr. Dershowitz had said, hastening to add, ""And I don't mean in the more radical portion of his explanation of his theory.""At another point, Mr. Philbin said: ""The suggestion has been made because of Professor Dershowitz's comments that the theory that the president's counsel is advancing is, 'the president can do anything he wants if he thinks it will advance his re-election, any quid pro quo, anything he wants, anything goes,' and that is not true.""On Twitter, Mr. Dershowitz said that the intended meaning of his remarks the previous evening, which circulated widely on social media and aired repeatedly on television, had been distorted.""They characterized my argument as if I had said that if a president believes that his re-election was in the national interest, he can do anything,"" Mr. Dershowitz wrote. ""I said nothing like that, as anyone who actually heard what I said can attest.""At least one part of Mr. Dershowitz's self-defense seemed accurate. Some Democratic senators and other critics accused him of suggesting that even Nixon was not impeachable, despite his clear crimes. But that accusation is incompatible with Mr. Dershowitz's main argument: that an impeachable ""high crime and misdemeanor"" requires an indictable offense.(His embrace of that view was itself disputed. It cuts against the view of most legal scholars, and he himself said in 1998 that he thought a ""technical crime"" was not required to impeach a president who abuses power. He has since disavowed that view, saying he changed his mind after research.)But the context of Mr. Dershowitz's view that abuse of power, absent an indictable crime, is not impeachable provides a guide for sorting through his inflammatory remarks, which were muddled in places.Mr. Dershowitz made his remarks in response to a question posed by a Republican senator about whether quid pro quos are routine in foreign policy. The president's defense team has repeatedly pointed out that administrations commonly withhold assistance as leverage to induce another country to take some step.The talking point elides the distinction between a president who is trying to achieve some public policy goal and one who is trying to obtain a personal benefit. In his answer, Mr. Dershowitz appeared to be attempting to rebut that objection, including by arguing that a president may have more than one motivation for acting.Specifically, he was arguing against the idea that presidents can be impeached for otherwise lawful actions if they are motivated by gaining personal political benefits rather than serving the public interest. One reason this would be folly, he maintained, was that often both motivations will simultaneously exist.(Mr. Trump's legal team has argued that he had a sincere interest in fighting corruption in Ukraine. House impeachment managers have scoffed at that notion and portrayed him as solely motivated by a desire to manufacture a basis to smear a political rival as corrupt.)But as he riffed, Mr. Dershowitz went further than merely observing that presidents routinely think about public opinion -- that is, voter sentiments -- as well as the public good when they weigh potential actions.He also collapsed any distinction between those two motives by saying that politicians often justifiably believe that their re-election would serve the public interest. That part of his remarks went viral.But the larger context was that under Mr. Dershowitz's theory, even a president who nakedly abuses power, without any reference to the purported public good, cannot be impeached -- so long as there is no indictable offense.On Thursday, Mr. Dershowitz emphasized that he was not trying to communicate that presidents wield unfettered power when they are trying to get re-elected.""Let me be clear once again (as I was in the Senate): a president seeking re-election cannot do anything he wants,"" Mr. Dershowitz wrote on Twitter. ""He is not above the law. He cannot commit crimes.""But, he argued, a lawful act ""does not become unlawful or impeachable if done with a mixed motive of both promoting the public interest and helping his RE-election.""PhotographAlan M. Dershowitz arriving at the Capitol. His comments during the Senate trial about the expansive reach of the president's power provoked criticism. He later said he had been misunderstood.

| Jump to first hitThe campaign by one count has run nearly 800 distinct Facebook ads highlighting the killing, but no one is sure what the political impact will ultimately be.WASHINGTON -- Things were on a clear course as far as President Trump's re-election campaign was concerned. The impeachment proceedings unfolding on Capitol Hill had proved to be a boost for volunteer recruitment and small-dollar donations. The year ended with a blockbuster jobs report and the unemployment rate falling to 3.5 percent, its lowest level since 1969.Mr. Trump was ready to aggressively attack a Democratic field he and his advisers viewed as weak across the board. Few if any of the president's top campaign aides were looking to change the channel.But Mr. Trump's decision to authorize the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, which he has described to friends and allies as a necessary action he was forced to take, has opened up a more uncertain political reality as the president enters an election year. That uncertainty was on display Tuesday night when Iran fired missiles at American forces in Iraq, in its first act of retaliation.Some advisers have highlighted to Mr. Trump the short-term lift the strike could give his re-election prospects, and his campaign has run nearly 800 distinct Facebook ads trumpeting the killing, according to Acronym, a progressive digital strategy group. The ads refer to Mr. Trump's ""leadership as commander in chief"" and direct voters to an ""Official Trump Military Survey,"" which acts as a portal to his campaign website.But whether the strike will help the president win over more voters rests on factors largely outside Mr. Trump's control. How Iran retaliates, and how voters who responded to his 2016 campaign message about ending ""forever wars"" in the Middle East react to a potentially escalating conflict are the two most immediate questions.""One of the major parts of the Trump coalition is voters who after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wanted to be much more cautious engaging in an assault with ground troops,"" said Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union. ""There's a significant number of libertarians and people who are weary about casually getting involved in a conflict with an Arab country that can take decades to resolve.""In the days since the attack, Mr. Trump has soaked up praise from Republican senators and allies, and aides described him as very comfortable with his decision. Mr. Trump, who has been eager to bask again in the kind of praise he received after ordering the military to bomb Syrian government forces after they used chemical weapons in 2017, has enjoyed his victory lap. He even described in graphic detail to friends the attacks on the American Embassy in Baghdad that preceded the strike against General Suleimani.Mr. Trump pointed out to one person who spoke to him on the phone last week that he had been pressured to take a harder line on Iran by some Republican senators whose support he needs now more than ever amid an impeachment battle. He also indicated that one of his top motivations for the strike was to protect Israel.Still, he resisted entreaties last week from his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to deliver a televised address on the raid, aides said. A White House spokesman did not respond to an email about Mr. Kushner.In his phone conversation last week, Mr. Trump responded that no one knew where things would end when the caller expressed concern that General Suleimani's death could end up starting a war. And he is aware as well of the consequences for his own political future, even while projecting confidence in his decision.The president and his aides have tried to use the response of Democratic presidential candidates as another example of how far left the party's field has tacked.""He was a monster. And he's no longer a monster; he's dead,"" Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday, adding: ""I don't hear too many people other than politicians who are trying to win the presidency. Those are the ones that are complaining. But I don't hear anybody else complaining.""The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, has targeted 2020 Democratic candidates like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both of whom have called the strike a dangerous escalation.In the case of Ms. Warren, some Trump advisers noted that she had initially called General Suleimani a ""murderer,"" a statement for which she was attacked by some liberal critics.""In a matter of a few months, the president has taken out two of the most wanted terrorists without American casualties,"" Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser to Mr. Trump, said of General Suleimani and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the ISIS leader killed by American forces in October.""That's simple and easy to explain and it has forced the Democrats and the professional left to do some convoluted explaining of how removing terrorists makes us more susceptible to terrorism.""Other administration officials have made a more direct comparison with General Suleimani and Mr. al-Baghdadi. Instead of acknowledging his title, ""general,"" they have focused on his terrorist activities and the number of people whose deaths he was responsible for over the years.But even those allies who have pressed Mr. Trump to confront Iran expressed uncertainty about what is to come, especially when the administration has struggled to explain what it is doing in the days since the strike.One Republican Senate staff member described an afternoon spent phoning the Defense Department to get more information about a draft letter from a senior military officer that suggested plans for a troop withdrawal from Iraq were underway.The answer he received was that Pentagon officials had only seen it on Twitter. It was the Iraqi Embassy that eventually confirmed to the Senate staff members that the letter was, in fact, real, before the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley, called an urgent news conference to make it clear that sending the letter had been an ""honest mistake.""Some officials have highlighted an interview that Gen. David H. Petraeus gave Sunday on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" as the best defense yet of Mr. Trump. General Petraeus, who has criticized key administration decisions about Middle East policy, described the killing of General Suleimani as ""bigger than Bin Laden"" and ""bigger than Baghdadi.""Yet the explanations of what took place have not included key details, or any description of the quality of the intelligence that officials have said led to Mr. Trump's order.Democrats say that Mr. Trump's decision to carry out a strike that two previous presidents had deemed to be too risky will be used against him by voters.Mr. Trump's action on Iran ""reinforces his weaknesses,"" said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, and played into a view of Mr. Trump as a rash decision maker. Voters, he said, are ""very likely to think about his conduct in Iran through that prism.""Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, said he disagreed. ""Americans want to see their president acting decisively and defending the nation's interests, and that's exactly what President Trump did,"" Mr. Murtaugh said. ""Democrats and much of the media risk appearing as Iran apologists who look to blame America for responding to terrorist acts and plans.""PhotographBy one count, the Trump campaign has already run nearly 800 Facebook ads trumpeting the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. (PHOTOGRAPH BY DOUG MILLS/THE NEW YORK TIMES)Word count: 1218Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hitAs House impeachment managers emphasizes the facts, President Trump's defense team calls the process unfair.WASHINGTON -- When President Trump's impeachment trial opened this week, the Democratic House managers prosecuting the case piled their table high with binders and notepads. Only a few rested on the defense table.The contrasting amount of material the two legal teams brought into the Senate chamber to support their initial arguments foreshadowed a broader difference in their approaches to the trial.In its opening days, the House managers have focused on the facts. They are trying to build a clear and coherent story around their theme that the president abused his power -- delving into the details, putting up slides to summarize major points, and playing a well-organized selection of video clips of statements by Mr. Trump and by House witnesses.Eschewing props, the defense team has focused instead on the process. They have used their time to reinforce the House Republican theme that impeachment is a sham and unfair to Mr. Trump -- urging the Senate to swiftly dispose of the case without subpoenaing any additional documents or testimony.Their strategy appears based on a narrative that is familiar from Mr. Trump's Twitter feed and Fox News programming -- that the impeachment is unfair -- and amplify it to a group that already believes it: Mr. Trump's core supporters, a bloc in the Republican Party that can threaten the political future of any Republican senator either by backing a primary challenger or by failing to turn out during a general election.""They have the senators in mind, but also the broader public,"" said David Alan Sklansky, a Stanford University criminal law professor and former prosecutor. ""The president's side wants to keep the heat on Republican senators to make sure they stay inside the tent.""Meanwhile, the House managers, led by Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, a former federal prosecutor, are plowing ahead trying to lay out their case that Mr. Trump seriously abused his powers, a message aimed at the voters who will decide his fate in November as well as the senators who are unlikely to remove him now.Wednesday was entirely a one-sided show as the House managers opened three days of opening arguments with the floor entirely to themselvesMr. Schiff led off the House team's case with a polished, confident performance, speaking extemporaneously at some points as he methodically outlined the Democratic case with the style of the former prosecutor he is. He dispensed with some of the more grandiose language that has occasionally flavored Democratic speeches against Mr. Trump and tried to link together the testimony and documents into a narrative for senators to follow.The other managers followed, each given a specific assignment to discuss certain parts of the case against Mr. Trump, but none with quite the ease and fluidity of Mr. Schiff, who has been Speaker Nancy Pelosi's point man on impeachment since the beginning.He dominated the day as the main presenter, spending more time at the lectern than all six other managers.But Mr. Schiff has also become a lightning rod among Republicans who seethed at what they saw as his self-righteousness and accused him repeatedly of mischaracterizing the evidence. He has become such a favorite villain for Republicans that they use him to rally their side.In some respects, Mr. Schiff and the other House managers are facing the classic challenge for prosecutors, legal specialists said. It is always the government's challenge in a trial to try to establish clarity, while defense teams need only muddy the waters and raise reasonable doubts to win an acquittal. They are also facing a jury that gets to decide for itself what the law means and whether to hear witnesses, and that is hardly made up of neutral people.The details of the broader Ukraine affair -- the monthslong campaign of pressure Mr. Trump and his proxies, including his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, brought on Ukraine's president to announce two investigations that could benefit Mr. Trump politically -- are complicated things to explain. Mr. Schiff and his colleagues have spent hours dissecting the details to build their case.Mr. Trump's White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, a longtime civil litigator, has been as combative as his client, the president, both in angry letters he signed during the House phase declaring that the executive branch would not participate, and now in person on the Senate floor. He has been joined by Jay Sekulow, Mr. Trump's private lawyer, in leading the White House legal team.While the team's role was to watch the House managers establish their case on Wednesday, Mr. Cipollone made clear on the opening day that his central message would be one of contempt for the House managers' efforts.""A partisan impeachment is like stealing an election,"" Mr. Cipollone declared, adding: ""It's outrageous. It's outrageous. And the American people won't stand for it, I'll tell you that right now.""He sat silent all day on Wednesday but demonstrated on Tuesday that he planned to take an aggressive approach not just defending the president but also assailing his accusers.Without much history in this kind of public political confrontations, Mr. Cipollone seemed a little nervous at first but quickly warmed to the task and adopted the relentless attack mode of his boss, his voice at times dripping with disdain over the Democrats he deemed partisan hacks and at one point demanding they apologize.James G. McGovern, a defense lawyer at Hogan Lovells and former federal prosecutor, argued that everyone knows what Mr. Trump did, but that Republicans simply do not believe it was worthy of impeachment. He said the Trump team's tactics reminded him of an analogy from the criminal trial world: the occasional refusal by a jury to refuse to convict a defendant even if the accusations are true.""It's almost a jury nullification type of defense,"" Mr. McGovern said. ""They want people to make the decision based on fundamental fairness or process. They want Republicans and the people inclined to vote their way to be comfortable with the decision based on some concept of unfairness.""Against that backdrop, it was striking that in detailing the argument that the process has been fatally unfair, Mr. Cipollone falsely asserted on Tuesday that Republican lawmakers had not been allowed into the secure room where the House Intelligence Committee deposed witnesses last year.In reality, dozens of Republican lawmakers from three committees and their staff lawyers participated in those depositions.Samuel Buell, a Duke University law professor and former federal prosecutor, said the Trump defense bore similarities to the tactic known as putting the government on trial -- trying to get a jury to doubt the prosecutors' case by suggesting the client was a victim of a rush to judgment by incompetent or corrupt law enforcement officials.""It parallels putting the government on trial in form but not in purpose, because I don't think that there are senators sitting on the fence going, 'I might vote for impeachment but not if I lose confidence in the process Adam Schiff used on the House side,""' Mr. Buell said. ""This argument is directed at the political arena.""Mr. Cipollone and his colleagues will get their chance to make their case uninterrupted starting Saturday, although it is possible the White House team may not use all of its allotted 24 hours, meaning it could wrap up by Monday.Mr. Cipollone's task at that point will be to deconstruct the House case that has sunk in over three days, arguing not just that the process has been unfair to the president but also that Democrats are trying to achieve through a trumped-up impeachment process what they cannot at the ballot box.Nicholas Fandos and Peter Baker contributed reporting.Nicholas Fandos and Peter Baker contributed reporting.PhotographAdam Schiff, left, the lead impeachment manager, and Pat A.

| Jump to first hitKen Starr and a third lawyer named to the team, Robert Ray, were independent counsels who investigated President Bill Clinton.President Trump enlisted the former independent counsel Ken Starr and the celebrity lawyer Alan Dershowitz to join his defense team on Friday, turning to two veterans of politically charged legal cases to secure his acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial that gets underway in earnest next week.Mr. Starr, whose investigation into President Bill Clinton led to his impeachment for perjury and obstruction of justice in 1998, will be joined by Robert W. Ray, his successor as independent counsel, who negotiated a settlement with Mr. Clinton as he left the White House that included a fine and the suspension of his law license.Mr. Dershowitz, a Harvard Law School professor emeritus who became famous as a defense counsel for high-profile defendants like O.J. Simpson, Claus von Bülow and Mike Tyson, will have a more limited role, presenting oral arguments at the Senate trial ""to address the constitutional arguments against impeachment and removal,"" the legal team said in a statement.In choosing the three prominent lawyers, the president assembled what he regards as an all-star television legal team, enlisting some of his favorite defenders from Fox News. But each of them brings his own baggage. Mr. Dershowitz represented Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender. Mr. Starr was pushed out as a university president because of his handling of sexual misconduct by the football team. And Mr. Ray was once charged with stalking a former girlfriend.Bringing in Mr. Starr will also invariably supercharge the discussion over Mr. Trump's impeachment by reopening the long-running debate over Mr. Clinton's case. Mr. Starr remains a polarizing figure from that era and every point he makes in favor of Mr. Trump's innocence will invite comparisons to the approach he took to Mr. Clinton.But Mr. Trump evidently sees Mr. Starr as an important validating presence who could endorse the view that the president's impeachment was illegitimate and unfair. The prosecutor whose investigation triggered the last presidential impeachment will now stand up on the floor of the Senate to declare that this impeachment is invalid. And he will explain why, in the view of someone who has been there, these charges do not add up to high crimes.""President Trump has done nothing wrong and is confident that this team will defend him, the voters, and our democracy from this baseless, illegitimate impeachment,"" the White House said in a statement on Friday night, confirming earlier news reports.For some Republicans who admire Mr. Starr, his participation may carry weight. ""I was encouraged by it,"" Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, said of the newly constituted legal team.But Mr. Trump's built-out team -- which will be led by the White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, and the president's personal lawyer Jay Sekulow -- faces the dual challenge of preserving the president's support among Republican senators and presenting his case to the wider public watching on television during an election year.As long as Senate Republicans stick with Mr. Trump as expected, the House Democrats prosecuting the case will not be able to muster the two-thirds vote required for conviction. Just as important to the president, though, is framing the debate in a way that he can take onto the campaign trail as he battles Democrats for a second term.This team may not provide the sort of defense the president's most combative supporters feel he needs. Stephen K. Bannon, the president's former chief strategist who has been hosting a daily radio show and podcast on impeachment with a group that often coordinates with the White House, said the addition of Mr. Dershowitz and Mr. Starr brought impressive legal power to Mr. Trump's team.But Mr. Bannon expressed concern that ""there are no fire breathers,"" as he put it. ""It's very conventional in its makeup and approach. But this is not playing on C-Span. The senators are not the jury; the American people are the jury. I strongly believe you need some of the fire breathers from the House, like Matt Gaetz, Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows and Lee Zeldin.""Mr. Trump wanted some of those congressmen, among his most stalwart House Republican allies, to be on the defense team, but Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, rejected the idea. Those House members, who are familiar with the testimony provided by witnesses during the impeachment inquiry, are expected to help behind the scenes and to help defend the president on television, people familiar with the president's legal defense plan said.Mr. Trump's team is also preparing for the possibility that witnesses will be called in the trial, despite Mr. McConnell's hope to avoid it.Other lawyers joining Mr. Trump's trial team include Pam Bondi, the former Florida attorney general who has been a spokeswoman for the defense effort; Jane Serene Raskin, who defended Mr. Trump during the investigation by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III; and Eric D. Herschmann, a partner at the law firm of another of Mr. Trump's longtime lawyers, Marc E. Kasowitz.The president has wanted media-savvy defenders who could play the same vocal role that his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani did during the Mueller investigation. Mr. Dershowitz has been a media figure for years and Mr. Starr was a contributor to Fox News until parting ways with the network because of his new role with Mr. Trump.But the choices were not without controversy, and Republicans on Friday voiced private reservations about some of the lawyers.Mr. Dershowitz has faced questions about his representation of Mr. Epstein, a financier who killed himself in a New York City jail in August. Mr. Dershowitz helped negotiate Mr. Epstein's lenient sentence on sex charges in 2008. Mr. Dershowitz has also been accused of engaging in sex with an underage girl he met through Mr. Epstein; he has denied the claim.Mr. Starr, who helped Mr. Dershowitz on the Epstein defense in 2007, was forced from his job as president of Baylor University in 2016 amid accusations he did not respond to allegations of sexual assault made by women against members of the school's football team.An outside investigation rebuked the university leadership, saying it had ""created a cultural perception that football was above the rules."" As he left the university presidency, Mr. Starr expressed ""heartfelt contrition for the tragedy and sadness that has unfolded"" and said he was ""profoundly sorry"" to victims who were not treated with the care and support they deserved.As for Mr. Ray, he turned himself in to New York authorities in 2006 in response to a misdemeanor charge of stalking a woman he had previously been dating. The police said he had sent emails and visited the woman against her wishes after she broke off their relationship. A law enforcement official said the case was sealed, suggesting it was most likely dismissed. Mr. Ray declined to comment.Mr. Trump himself has previously questioned Mr. Starr's zealous pursuit of Mr. Clinton. In 1999, after the House voted to impeach the president largely along party lines, Mr. Trump told interviewers that Mr. Starr was a ""wacko"" and a ""lunatic."" But more recently, he is said to have enjoyed watching him on television. Mr. Starr declined to comment on Friday.Mr. Trump faces two articles of impeachment accusing him of abusing his office by pressuring Ukraine to announce investigations of his Democratic rivals and obstructing Congress by refusing to provide documents or permit testimony during the House inquiry.During his television appearances, Mr. Starr has argued that the articles of impeachment passed by the House largely along party lines were ""woefully inadequate"" to justify removing a president from office. He has contrasted that with his investigation into Mr. Clinton, where the president was accused of felonies for trying to cover up his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, a onetime White House intern, during a sexual harassment lawsuit.In a brief telephone interview, Mr. Dershowitz said he expected his sole role to be arguing on behalf of Mr. Trump before the Senate next Friday, making points he had made in writing and on television.He said that he ""worried about the precedent"" set by the two articles of impeachment, which he described as ""too vague and open-ended,"" and absent ""high crimes and misdemeanors.""The statement announcing his appointment described Mr. Dershowitz as ""nonpartisan when it comes to the Constitution,"" having opposed the impeachment of Mr. Clinton and voted for Hillary Clinton. ""He is participating in this impeachment trial to defend the integrity of the Constitution and to prevent the creation of a dangerous constitutional precedent,"" the statement said.The return of Mr. Starr to the impeachment stage was an astonishing development for many veterans of the battle two decades ago. Ms. Lewinsky expressed her disbelief on Twitter on Friday, writing, ""this is definitely an 'are you kidding me?' kinda day"" with an expletive before the word ""kidding.""Annie Karni contributed reporting.PhotographKen Starr, whose report led to Bill Clinton's impeachment.

| Jump to first hitMichael R. Bloomberg's campaign will air a 60-second ad promoting his record on gun control, while President Trump has lined up a commercial celebrating his time in office.DES MOINES -- Two billionaires will pitch their presidential candidacies amid the beer and car commercials of the Super Bowl on Sunday, with Michael R. Bloomberg spending a full minute addressing gun violence and President Trump using 30 seconds to highlight his first years in office.The Bloomberg ad, which his campaign says it hopes will ""stop people in their tracks,"" features an emotional story told by a mother still grieving the loss of her son, shown onscreen in youth football gear, who was killed by gunfire at the age of 20. She points to Mr. Bloomberg's record on seeking tougher gun laws as the reason she now has ""a dog in the fight"" for the presidency.By contrast, Mr. Trump's ad features relatively general themes and imagery of the president's rallies, with a narrator boasting about low unemployment and the military. The ad could be mistaken as a generic Trump campaign ad; it is not particularly yoked to the football game, nor does it contain the sort of creative or conceptual touches that distinguish expensive Super Bowl ads.Yet with the president's flair for dramatics and the suspense of a great reveal, the Trump campaign said that it would be airing two different 30-second ads during the game, and that the second ad ""will be seen by the world for the first time when it actually airs.""The dueling presidential ads, which the campaigns revealed Thursday, are as much a contrast in substance -- the Trump ad celebrates a ""safer"" America while the Bloomberg ad points to children killed by gun violence -- as they are a show of financial might and messaging power.And they provide further evidence that the 2020 election will be a yearlong brawl on the national airwaves, with well-financed candidates like Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Trump exploiting their vast resources to reach huge audiences. Never before have two presidential candidates aired national ads during the Super Bowl.Both campaigns spent $11 million for 60 seconds in front of what is regularly the largest television audience of the year (predictions for this year's Super Bowl, which will be broadcast on Fox, hover around 100 million viewers).Despite its eight-figure sticker price, Mr. Bloomberg's ad is a relatively small slice of his relentless national advertising strategy: He has already spent $275 million of his multibillion-dollar fortune on television, radio and digital media.His campaign has spent roughly $90 million on television ads that feature some attack on Mr. Trump, but, notably, the Super Bowl ad does not even mention the president.Instead, it opens with Calandrian Kemp sharing the story of her son, George Kemp Jr., as the camera pans across childhood pictures of George in football gear. He was shot and killed in 2013 during an altercation while he was at mechanic school; he was 20.""I just kept saying, you cannot tell me that the child I gave birth to is no longer here,"" Ms. Kemp says in the ad, her voice breaking. The screen then shows white text on a black background: ""2,900 children die from gun violence every year.""That figure has been cited by Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group primarily financed by Mr. Bloomberg.Ms. Kemp then praises Mr. Bloomberg's record on gun control. ""I know Mike is not afraid of the gun lobby -- they're scared of him,"" she says. ""And they should be.""The ad is scheduled to air between the end of the Super Bowl halftime show and the beginning of the third quarter, the campaign said.[Video: Watch on YouTube.]In the age of data-driven, targeted advertising, spending so much on a single ad to reach such a broad audience may seem wasteful. But Howard Wolfson, a top adviser to Mr. Bloomberg, said the thought behind buying an ad during the Super Bowl was simple: It will reach the largest available audience, and Super Bowl ads are often talked about well after the game.""It's a time when people get together and they sit down and they watch the Super Bowl, but they also know that there are these ads and there's a lot of conversation about the ads,"" Mr. Wolfson said. ""It's a very wide net, it's a broad swath of Americans, and this is an issue that there's been an awful lot of agreement on.""The campaign said it had selected an ad about gun violence for the Super Bowl slot because it was an issue ""central to Mike Bloomberg."" Indeed, Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, made the final call. When shown a variety of ads to choose from, Mr. Bloomberg was ""adamant"" that the campaign run the one featuring Ms. Kemp.""I cried the first time I saw it,"" Mr. Wolfson said. ""Other people who saw it in the office cried. There are a lot of fairly hard-bitten political people here.""Mr. Trump's ad begins with a news report from Mr. Trump's favorite night -- election night 2016 -- as a narrator intones that ""America demanded change, and change is what we got.""Quick flashes of military operations -- an aircraft carrier cutting through choppy seas, a fighter jet making a hard banking turn -- give way to a recited list of economic realities under Mr. Trump: rising wages and low unemployment.At the end of the ad, Mr. Trump is shown speaking at one of his raucous rallies, proclaiming, ""Ladies and gentlemen, the best is yet to come.""[Video: Watch on YouTube.]Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Bloomberg have shown a propensity for advertising during sporting events, which are some of the rare broadcasts that still capture live audiences in an age of digital streaming platforms. Mr. Bloomberg's campaign ran ads throughout the N.F.L. playoffs, and Mr. Trump advertised during the World Series last year.Mr. Bloomberg is not competing in the Iowa caucuses, which will take place the night after the Super Bowl, nor has he mounted a concerted effort in New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina, which also vote in February. He is instead focusing on the 14 states that vote on Super Tuesday, March 3, when about 40 percent of the Democratic delegates will be allocated.By flooding the airwaves across the country, Mr. Bloomberg is betting he can drown out his Democratic rivals, who are still focused on campaigning in the early-voting states. The advertising blitz has helped him move up to 7 percent support in the latest New York Times national polling average, good enough for fifth place.Of course, seeing two political ads in a night that is built on entertainment could turn off some viewers. But Mr. Bloomberg's advisers said they were not concerned about running an emotional ad about a divisive issue amid the other, often humorous commercials.""I think it's going to stop people in their tracks,"" Mr. Wolfson said. ""Frankly, amid the dancing raisins and souped-up cars, a mother speaking fundamental and powerful truths about her experience and her son's loss will draw an awful lot of attention, deservedly so.""PhotographBoth Michael R. Bloomberg, above, and President Trump will air ads during Sunday's game, a first for two presidential candidates.

| Jump to first hitThe move places a loyalist atop the intelligence agencies that the president has long battled.WASHINGTON -- President Trump on Wednesday named Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany who quickly antagonized the establishment after arriving in Berlin in 2018, to be the acting director of national intelligence overseeing the nation's 17 spy agencies.By choosing Mr. Grenell, who has little experience in intelligence or in running a large bureaucracy, the president signaled that he wants a trusted, aggressive leader atop an intelligence community that he has long viewed with suspicion and at times gone to war against.As ambassador, Mr. Grenell made public statements that some German officials took as expressing opposition to the government there, an extraordinary intervention into domestic affairs that diplomats typically avoid. He attacked what he called ""failed"" open-border policies in Germany, which has resettled hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees, and criticized Berlin's stances on Iran, military spending and Chinese investment in global telephone networks. He also expressed an eagerness to empower conservatives throughout Europe.""I absolutely want to empower other conservatives throughout Europe, other leaders,"" Mr. Grenell told Breitbart, a far-right website, in an interview shortly after his arrival in Germany. ""I think there is a groundswell of conservative policies that are taking hold because of the failed policies of the left.""While intelligence directors have tried to serve as neutral arbiters of facts, Mr. Grenell's experience as an ideological advocate prompted some former officials to express concern that he could color the intelligence he presents to Mr. Trump rather than present an objective assessment.""This is a job requiring leadership, management, substance and secrecy,"" said John Sipher, a former C.I.A. officer. ""He doesn't have the kind of background and experience we would expect for such a critical position.""Mr. Grenell is expected to keep his current ambassadorship as long as he is acting intelligence director, one administration official said. Mr. Grenell did not respond to a request for comment.His bare-knuckled approach clearly resonates with the president and his inner circle. Last spring, shortly before the now-infamous removal of the American ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, Mr. Trump's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., invoked Mr. Grenell in a tweet about conservative discontent with Ms. Yovanovitch. ""We need more @RichardGrenell's and less of these jokers as ambassadors,"" the younger Mr. Trump wrote.Mr. Grenell, who has pushed to advance gay rights in his current post, is also thought to be the first openly gay cabinet member.Republican senators had privately pushed the Trump administration to nominate a national security professional for the post, and advisers made clear that the president was not nominating Mr. Grenell for the permanent job. Mr. Trump has installed acting leaders in other top government vacancies, giving him freedom to maneuver around the demands of Senate confirmation.By law, the current acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has to give up his temporary role before March 12. Mr. Grenell is expected to begin his new job on Thursday. Mr. Maguire, in a statement on Wednesday, thanked Mr. Trump and said that when he was confirmed by the Senate to lead the counterterrorism center, he ""never imagined what would follow.""Mr. Trump can choose any Senate-confirmed official to replace Mr. Maguire, who has served as the acting director of national intelligence since the resignation last summer of Dan Coats, a former Republican senator from Indiana. Mr. Grenell was confirmed by the Senate for his current job after a delay caused by parliamentary tactics that stirred a bipartisan outcry.He would be the latest in a line of intelligence directors who have had varied policy experience including diplomatic or military backgrounds rather than stints in the intelligence world.But Mr. Grenell is also an acerbic combatant who throws regular punches at ""fake news"" reporters and Mr. Trump's opponents online. Last month, he angrily demanded The Washington Post retract a report, which he insisted was based on fabricated sources, that Mr. Trump had threatened to impose auto tariffs on European cars if European leaders did not adopt a tougher line on Iran's nuclear program. The next day, Germany's defense minister publicly confirmed it.Mr. Grenell honed his combative style when he worked as a spokesman at the United Nations for the former ambassador John R. Bolton. Often to the surprise -- and sometimes the horror -- of the State Department's more staid communications officials who worked for Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Grenell would take on reporters and argue long into the night about stories appearing in major newspapers and on television.In recent days, after Attorney General William P. Barr said in an interview that Mr. Trump's tweets made his job more difficult, Mr. Grenell appeared on Fox News to counter that view. ""It makes my job so much easier,"" Mr. Grenell said, offering the example of Mr. Trump's pressure on NATO allies to spend more on defense.In a country where former President Barack Obama is still widely popular, Mr. Grenell's style put off other officials and ultimately isolated him, the German publication Der Spiegel reported last year. ""The powerful avoid him,"" the newsmagazine wrote. ""Doors have been shut.""Much of Mr. Grenell's criticism has been directed at German military spending, its decision to stand behind the nuclear deal with Iran and its wavering on the American demand to ban Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, from building next-generation mobile networks.He has also had successes, including getting Germany to agree to take American liquefied natural gas and to pull the landing rights of an Iranian airline. A number of German companies have pulled out of Iran, warned by Mr. Grenell that they could run afoul of American sanctions if they did business with Tehran.And while German military spending has continued to rise during the Trump administration, the government in Berlin has ratcheted back its goals for increasing spending.While most of the previous directors of national intelligence have tried to take a nonpartisan tone, Mr. Trump has looked askance at officials who have tried to remain neutral. He has increasingly looked to people for positions who he believes share his views.""Grenell, from the beginning, was an ultraright-wing sniper on social media,"" said Douglas H. Wise, a former senior intelligence official. ""He is certainly in line with the Trump agenda.""Intelligence professionals reacted with surprise, and some with disappointment, questioning Mr. Grenell's experience and temperament. The appointment demonstrated that Mr. Trump little understands or values the intelligence community, said Nicholas J. Rasmussen, the former head of the National Counterterrorism Center.""Personal loyalty is prized above relevant experience and demonstrated competence,"" said Mr. Rasmussen, now the acting executive director of the McCain Institute. ""Professionalism and integrity are devalued. The signal this sends to our career national security and intelligence professionals is unmistakable.""Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, criticized Mr. Trump for appointing another acting director, rather than choosing an official nominee, ""apparently in an effort to side step the Senate's constitutional authority.""While it has never been clear how Mr. Trump viewed Mr. Maguire, there is little doubt that the president would prefer a partisan fighter in the post. Mr. Maguire, a retired admiral, became the acting director in August just as a whistle-blower inside the C.I.A. filed a complaint about Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine.Since even before the acquittal of Mr. Trump in the Senate impeachment trial, the president has been pushing to remove officials seen as disloyal to or undermining of the president or holding views contrary to the White House, looking for replacements who are more likely to follow the president's wishes.Mr. Trump has at times disparaged American intelligence agencies because he did not agree with their findings, perhaps chiefly the conclusion that Russia interfered with the 2016 presidential election to help him win. He told his intelligence chiefs to ""go back to school"" after they offered assessments on Iran and North Korea at odds with his policy initiatives.Anxious to avoid a repeat, Mr. Maguire's aides initially pushed for this year's public hearing to be canceled, a request that lawmakers have rejected.Tensions between the White House and intelligence agencies only grew during the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Maguire initially blocked the whistle-blower complaint from being forwarded to Congress, following the guidance of administration lawyers. But he eventually helped broker the agreement to provide the complaint to Congress's intelligence committees, allowing the impeachment inquiry to gain steam.When Mr. Coats announced his resignation in July, Mr. Trump initially nominated a Republican ally in Congress, Representative John Ratcliffe of Texas, to be the next top intelligence chief, a job considered to be among the most nonpartisan in Washington. But Mr. Trump quickly dropped those plans after pushback from Democrats and some key Republicans who worried Mr. Ratcliffe's loyalty to the president and lack of intelligence experience would make him nearly impossible to confirm. There were also concerns that Mr. Ratcliffe exaggerated some of what he included on his résumé.After Mr. Ratcliffe was dropped from consideration, Mr. Trump promised to announce a new nominee soon. But the list of people with the requisite experience who have not been critical of the president is slim.The administration considered, and discarded, a number of potential nominees, including Pete Hoekstra, the American ambassador to the Netherlands and a former Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and Representative Chris Stewart, a Utah Republican on the committee.Julian E. Barnes reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York. David E. Sanger and Michael Crowley contributed reporting from Washington.PhotographRichard Grenell, named by President Trump as acting intelligence director, has an aggressive style.

| Jump to first hitWASHINGTON -- People warned Marc Benioff, the billionaire chief executive of Salesforce, not to bother talking to the White House about global warming. But Mr. Benioff, a tech mogul and environmental philanthropist, felt sure he had found a climate change solution that even President Trump could love: Planting trees.Never mind that the idea came from former Vice President Al Gore, who has demanded Mr. Trump's resignation over his energy policies. Never mind that Mr. Trump has begun the yearlong process of withdrawing America from the Paris Agreement on climate change, mocked Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist, and worked to eliminate every regulation aimed at reducing planet-warming emissions.The idea of planting one trillion trees had one enormous political advantage: It was practically sacrifice-free, no war on coal, no transition from fossil fuels, no energy conservation or investment in renewable sources of power that Mr. Trump loves to mock, like the windmills that cause cancer or the solar panels that are not ""strong enough.""""I just knew this is a really good idea. I said I will pitch it and see what happens,"" Mr. Benioff said. ""Even my chief of staff said to me, 'You're not going.""'How the trillion trees initiative migrated from Mr. Benioff's PowerPoint presentations to the president's pronouncements, first at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month, then his State of the Union address last week, is a study in ad hoc policymaking at the Trump White House. A personal appeal from a celebrity voice got the idea past traditional gatekeepers. A back channel through Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, gave it life, and a re-election campaign that has sought to soften some of Mr. Trump's sharper edges ensured its publicity.It is far from clear that the United States government will actually plant any trees, or that a trillion trees would do much in the near term to stop the worst effects of planetary warming. Tom Crowther, an environmental scientist and an author of the study that sparked the movement, cautioned that the full benefits would not be seen for about 100 years, when most of the new trees would reach full maturity. During that time, he said, the world needs to drive down fossil fuel emissions.""If tree planting is just used as an excuse to avoid cutting greenhouse gas emissions or to further limit environmental protection, then it could be a real disaster,"" said Dr. Crowther, who studies ecosystem ecology at ETH Zurich.But such details might be beside the point for a White House initiative that is heavier on politics than science. One senior administration official described the tree initiative as one the president believes will ""bring people together.""""We're committed to conserving the majesty of God's creation and the natural beauty of our world,"" Mr. Trump told investors and world leaders in Davos.Despite his longstanding antagonism toward climate science, Mr. Trump in recent months has struck a softer tone on the topic. In a meeting with President Emmanuel Macron of France in December, he said climate change was ""very important"" to him. He recently denied the undeniable fact that he ever declared global warming a hoax.He even said he was reading a book on the topic. (The book, according to the White House, was, ""Donald J. Trump: An Environmental Hero"" by Ed Russo, a former consultant to the president).The president's commitment to a global effort to plant one trillion trees by 2030 surprised even White House officials who work on environment policy. Mr. Trump never uttered the phrase ""climate change"" in his pledge. He described it instead as a plan ""to protect the environment.""Yet the science behind it is centered on planetary warming. As trees grow, they absorb the carbon dioxide emissions that drive climate change. According to researchers at ETH Zurich, worldwide reforestation with 1.2 trillion trees could reduce atmospheric carbon in the atmosphere by about 25 percent.And with polls showing many young Republicans breaking with their party on climate change, political strategists described the initiative as part of an effort to steer Mr. Trump toward more environmentally friendly messaging without abandoning the development of more planet-warming fossil fuel energy.""It's obvious the president's team understands this is a weakness for him right now given the rhetoric he's used, the dismissal of climate science and all of the executive actions that are consistent with that rhetoric,"" said Carlos Curbelo, a former Republican congressman from Florida who championed a carbon tax when he was in office.The shift is happening across the Republican Party, which has inched over decades from denying the existence of climate change to saying it was part of a natural cycle to dismissing it as unstoppable to considering modest policy responses. On Wednesday, House Republicans introduced a package of climate change legislation that would fund the capture and storage of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel plants, research new ways to use and commercialize the captured carbon, and conserve the environment by, for instance, planting trees.""Trees aren't the only solution to addressing the climate issue, but I'll say they are by far one of the best solutions,"" said Representative Bruce Westerman, an Arkansas Republican who is developing legislation to bring the United States into the trillion tree plan.""It's a big goal to plant a trillion trees globally, but I think the world needs a big solution,"" Mr. Westerman, a Yale-educated engineer and forester, said.It remains unclear what the Trump administration is committing to do in joining the trillion tree plan. While one senior administration official said this week that the White House was busy preparing a tree-planting target, another noted that the $4.8 trillion budget issued Tuesday did not mention the plan.This is not the first time a back channel has been used to let a big name promote the climate cause. During Mr. Trump's presidential transition, Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, brought Mr. Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio to Trump Tower to press for action on climate change -- to no avail.Those who deny the established science of climate change are confident Mr. Trump's heart is with them. They point to another part of his speech in Davos, in which he railed against the ""prophets of doom"" who warn of climate catastrophes.""Donald Trump is as militant against the climate hysteria as ever,"" said Steven J. Milloy, a member of Mr. Trump's transition team who runs a website promoting the false theories that climate change alternately isn't real or harmful.Mr. Benioff, in a telephone interview, said he decided to take a chance anyway. Mr. Gore had bent his ear last summer about emerging research into reforestation and climate change. After discussions with scientists at the Benioff Ocean Initiative, a program at the University of California, Santa Barbara, he was hooked.""I realized this looks like a practical, actionable thing,"" he said.He discussed it with other scientists, such as Jane Goodall, the English primatologist, as well as financiers, hoping to rally governments and companies around the initiative at the World Economic Forum.Mr. Benioff has known Mr. Kushner since before Mr. Trump took office and has worked with Ivanka Trump on issues like job training. He traveled to Washington to discuss the tree initiative with Mr. Kushner in October.""People think something that's actually not true, which is that they're not interested in hearing new ideas or hearing science,"" Mr. Benioff said of the Trump administration.""Trees are the ultimate bipartisan issue,"" he added. ""Everyone is pro-tree.""Mr. Gore applauded Mr. Benioff for getting the issue on President Trump's radar. ""I would not have expected him to have any success on that,"" he said in an interview.But he was skeptical. ""I don't have any trust in the Trump administration's approach to climate because no one can be deemed as serious on the climate crisis unless they're in favor of emission reductions,"" he said.Dr. Crowther was more optimistic. Speaking from a camper in the Moroccan desert where he half-joked he had gone to escape the attention his work has spurred, he said, ""If restoration can be socially and ecologically responsible, I think it poses a really exciting opportunity for bipartisan leadership.""Mr. Curbelo, the rare Republican politician who has embraced a politically difficult response to climate change, conceded that tree planting and carbon capture programs were modest at best, and both parties would need to negotiate ambitious emissions cuts.""However,"" he added, ""that was impossible when Republicans weren't even at the table.""For more climate news sign up for the Climate Fwd: newsletter or follow @NYTClimate on Twitter .PhotographMarc Benioff at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where President Trump embraced his Trillion Trees plan.

| Jump to first hitSenator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, knows the Senate is unlikely to convict President Trump. So he is focusing on what constitutes a fair trial -- and trying to put Republicans in a box.WASHINGTON -- Senator Chuck Schumer had a pointed warning when John R. Bolton declared himself willing to testify in President Trump's impeachment trial: Republicans who refused Democrats' demands for witnesses and documents would be ""participating in a cover-up.""For Mr. Schumer, the voluble New York Democrat and minority leader, the resurfacing of Mr. Bolton, the former White House national security adviser, as a potential witness was a way to squeeze vulnerable Republicans like Senator Susan Collins of Maine to cross party lines and effectively give him control of the floor during a historic trial over whether to remove Mr. Trump. But Ms. Collins, who is a top Democratic target facing a tough re-election in November, quickly made it known she did not find Mr. Schumer's tactics persuasive.""I don't think Chuck Schumer is very interested in my opinion,"" she told reporters in the Capitol. ""I don't think he's really very interested in doing anything but trying to defeat me by telling lies to the people of Maine. And you can quote me on that.""Ms. Collins's sharp retort illustrates Mr. Schumer's core challenge as the Senate, likely this week, convenes only the third impeachment trial of a sitting president in American history. As leader of the opposition, he must hold together Senate Democrats (including five who are running for president) while securing the cooperation of some of the very same Republicans he is working to defeat.For Mr. Schumer, who has spent three years as the Senate's top Democrat in the shadow of his House counterpart, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the impeachment trial of Mr. Trump is both an opportunity and a risk.It is no secret in the capital that the job Mr. Schumer really wants is that of Senate majority leader -- a post he thought would be his with Hillary Clinton in the White House, before Mr. Trump's 2016 victory unleashed a political earthquake. A schmoozer and a deal-maker, he is more suited to the politics of getting things done than to the partisan knife-fighting culture of Mr. Trump's Washington.""I think it's very hard for him to be the leader of a resistance,"" said Rebecca Kirszner Katz, a progressive strategist and aide for Mr. Schumer's predecessor, Harry Reid. ""The weekend that millions of women took to the streets to protest Trump, Schumer went to the Women's March, and the next day had a press conference on the size of overhead bins on airplanes. The world was falling apart, but Chuck Schumer was still doing his Sunday press conferences.""Over the past few weeks, as Ms. Pelosi and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, engaged in a bitter standoff in recent weeks over the shape of the trial -- the speaker refused to send the articles, while Mr. McConnell refused to commit to hearing any new evidence in the Senate -- Mr. Schumer was still pushing daily for a deal with Republicans to hear from witnesses and secure more documents.Mr. Schumer lost that round, when Mr. McConnell announced last week that he had the votes lined up to move ahead with the trial without committing to either. Now, the Democratic leader faces a more consequential set of tests once the trial gets underway. Mr. Schumer said he plans to force a series of votes on calling witnesses and hearing new evidence, pressuring Republicans to join the call for more information or be tagged as complicit in what Democrats have branded presidential obstruction.There is some evidence the strategy is working: On Friday, Ms. Collins said she was working with a ""fairly small group of Republicans"" to ensure that witnesses could be called.The Senate math is not in Mr. Schumer's favor. With 47 senators caucusing with the Democrats (including two independents who routinely vote with them), he is still four shy of the 51 votes he would need to force subpoenas for witnesses and documents. While it appears that Ms. Collins and two other Republicans -- Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah -- might be persuaded to go along in voting to hear from Mr. Bolton and others, Mr. Schumer was hard pressed to name a fourth vote.""There are people vulnerable politically. There are people who have a conscience,"" he said in an interview. ""There are people who are retiring. There are people who might have some beef. Who knows? I will tell you this: I talk to Republicans all the time, and they're upset by this president.""In the end, Mr. Schumer knows there is almost no chance the Republican-led Senate will convict Mr. Trump for pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, a move that would take two-thirds of senators, or 67. But the focus on what constitutes a fair trial, he argued, will either succeed in unearthing new information about Mr. Trump, or at least help Democrats pick up seats in 2020.""It's a win-win,"" he said, describing his strategy, though he quickly corrected himself, settling on ""no lose"" as a better frame. If Republicans block new evidence, Democrats will deem the trial ""illegitimate and a sham,"" he said, adding, ""Pursuing witnesses and documents makes us better off, no matter the outcome.""The position is at odds with the one Mr. Schumer took almost exactly 21 years ago, when he opposed calling witnesses during the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. (Mr. Schumer likes to recount his status as, in his own words, a ""historical footnote"": the only member of Congress to have voted three times against Mr. Clinton's impeachment -- twice as a House member in 1998, first in the Judiciary Committee and then on the floor, and again after winning election to the Senate.)Mr. Schumer argued that there was no contradiction. Unlike the witnesses he is seeking against Mr. Trump -- including Mr. Bolton and Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff -- the Clinton witnesses had already testified, so there was not necessarily anything new to be learned from them. By contrast, Mr. Trump directed a blanket stonewall of the House impeachment inquiry, refusing to provide any documents or allow White House officials to testify.Republicans, however, howl that he is being hypocritical. They say Mr. Schumer is engaged in a transparent bid to play politics with the most sacred of senatorial duties. As to whether he will get four Republicans on board on key questions of how the trial should unfold, Senator John Kennedy, the Louisiana Republican known for his folksy quips, said: ""When donkeys fly.""But Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, said Mr. Schumer had ""played the hand he has very well.""""There's a reason President Trump and Mitch McConnell are deathly afraid of having key witnesses, because it can change the dynamics of a trial,"" Mr. Van Hollen said. ""And the flip side of that is that if Republicans vote to block key witnesses and evidence, it will expose the trial as a fraud.""At 69, Mr. Schumer has spent his entire adult life in politics. The son of a Brooklyn exterminator and a homemaker, he caught the politics bug in 1968 as a Harvard undergraduate campaigning for Eugene McCarthy, and disappointed his parents by running for the New York State Assembly at 23, fresh out of Harvard Law. (At his mother's insistence, he took the bar exam, but he never practiced.)He won that race and every race since, winning election to the House in 1980, the Senate in 1998 after a hard-fought campaign in which his opponent, the incumbent Republican senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, memorably called him ""a putzhead"" -- a Yiddish insult that was a bridge too far for New York voters.With his familiar Brooklyn accent and half-moon glasses perched on the downslope of his nose, Mr. Schumer has long been an upbeat, if publicity-hungry, figure in the Capitol, giving rise to the well-worn joke that there is no place in Washington more dangerous than between him and a camera.Naturally gregarious, Mr. Schumer loves legislating -- he once briefly contemplated running for governor but decided against it -- and retail politics. He visits each of New York's 62 counties once a year, can tick off Long Island high schools by name and knows the best place in Buffalo for a ""beef on weck"" sandwich.There is a little bit of Senator Pothole in him. His political modus operandi is as follows: Fix someone's problem (any problem, doesn't matter what, so long as it helps the middle class), and then hold a Sunday morning news conference in New York to talk about it. He has done all this while raising millions of dollars from his hometown industry -- Wall Street -- prompting criticism that he is a corporate politician, out of step with the rising Democratic left.To say he is a hands-on leader would be an understatement; when his 96-year-old father was rushed to the hospital with an acute attack of gallstones a few Saturdays ago, Mr. Schumer was dialing up colleagues on his flip phone to give them advice about Sunday morning talk show appearances. But his close friends say he never had a grand plan to rise up the ranks.""There was no long term strategy: I'm going to wait X years in the House and then I'm going to the Senate,"" said Carol Kellermann, who has known Mr. Schumer for 50 years, since their days at Harvard, and later was his chief of staff. Still, she added, ""I think he wishes that he would be the majority leader. That would be a capstone of all the legislative work he has done.""Mr. Trump's election in 2016 left the ordinarily cheery Mr. Schumer moping around his Brooklyn apartment. But the New York senator, who is Jewish, said he soon had ""an epiphany, a message from the heavens, if you will, because I believe in God.""""Chuck, stop moping,"" he said he told himself. ""Had Hillary been president and you in the majority, the job would have been easier, more fun, and you would have gotten good things done, which is why you're here. But with Trump as president and you as minority leader, your job is much more important.""PhotographSenator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, is trying to hold Democrats together while securing the cooperation of the Republicans he is working to defeat.

| Jump to first hitBy nominating John Ratcliffe for director of national intelligence, President Trump gave the Senate a choice: Accept a Trump stalwart or stick with the acting stalwart.WASHINGTON -- The legal career of Representative John Ratcliffe, Republican of Texas, almost ended before it began. As a teenager, the future federal prosecutor confused ""reverse"" and ""drive"" on a borrowed stick-shift car and plowed through the window of a hearing-aid shop in Carbondale, Ill., where the proprietor had to yank an older customer to safety.""My daughter told him he could drive, but what he did not say was that he didn't know how,"" said Mary Koster, whose Chevette hurtled through the window that day.The accident is an apt metaphor for Mr. Ratcliffe's recent political trajectory, in which he has ridden light experience and a flair for at-times reckless braggadocio to become President Trump's nominee to be America's top spy, the director of national intelligence.Mr. Ratcliffe gunned for the job last July, slammed on the brakes, but is back in drive, with Mr. Trump giving senators a choice: confirm a nominee they objected to last summer or accept an equally contentious candidate, the acting director Richard Grenell, for at least the rest of the year.Both men are thinly experienced, combative Trump loyalists who raise concerns about bringing political bias to a sensitive role guiding 17 intelligence agencies. In the 2000s, Mr. Ratcliffe was an appointee of President George W. Bush to the U.S. attorney's office in the Eastern District of Texas, where he led an antiterrorism unit. The last time Mr. Trump floated his name for the job, he abruptly pulled the plug after it emerged that Mr. Ratcliffe had overstated his counterterrorism experience.Mr. Grenell, who also serves as Mr. Trump's ambassador to Germany and was previously a U.S. spokesman at the United Nations, has already taken action at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, freezing hiring and initiating a review intended to shrink the office.Lawmakers are divided. Some want a quick Senate confirmation vote on Mr. Ratcliffe, who would in theory be more accountable to congressional oversight committees. Others in Congress say Mr. Grenell possesses more intelligence heft, having spent years immersed in national security issues.By contrast, they say, Mr. Ratcliffe has done relatively little to augment his thin experience. As a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, he has a reputation for absenteeism and lackluster interest in complicated intelligence issues, preferring loud defenses of Mr. Trump's foreign policy stances.Mr. Ratcliffe's allies say he possesses personal qualities that would offset his lack of experience, and that it is difficult to discern how much antiterrorism experience he had as a prosecutor, because some records are classified.""He's a good listener, always well-grounded in law and the principles that undergird democracy and the Justice Department,"" John D. Ashcroft, attorney general in the George W. Bush administration and a former Ratcliffe law partner, said in an interview. ""These are personality traits and characteristics that would serve him extremely well.""Telegenic, with a fraternity president demeanor, Mr. Ratcliffe grew up in Chicago's northwest suburbs, the youngest of six children born to educators. In 1977, his father, Robert, took a job as a dean at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. Mr. Ratcliffe worked as a golf caddy in summer and went to the University of Notre Dame, where he was on the golf team and graduated in three years. He received his law degree from Southern Methodist University near Dallas, where he met his wife, Michele, a native of Detroit and a former federal prosecutor now in private practice.The Ratcliffes and their two daughters live on a golf course in Heath, Texas, a suburb of Dallas. During the eight years he worked for the Justice Department Mr. Ratcliffe served simultaneously as Heath's mayor, an unpaid, nonpartisan job that was his first elected office.It was in the mayor's office that he said he got valuable experience for his U.S. attorney post. ""I've really enjoyed my public service work as the mayor of the city of Heath,"" Mr. Ratcliffe said, acknowledging he had no law enforcement experience when he got the position at the U.S. attorney's office.He was working as a corporate lawyer in Dallas when Mr. Bush named him assistant U.S. attorney and chief of antiterrorism and national security for the Eastern District of Texas.Mr. Ratcliffe told a Texas reporter the new job ""would provide me an opportunity to expand my public service into issues of national security.""In an interview, Ms. Ratcliffe said news stories about Mr. Ratcliffe's lack of terrorism-related experience in those years were at times ""downright wrong.""""He has experience I don't even know about,"" she said. ""We've been married for 30 years, and I know there's some things he cannot talk about.""Arnold Spencer, a former prosecutor who reported to Mr. Ratcliffe in the U.S. attorney's office, said the office handled about 1,500 cases a year, roughly half of them involving guns and drugs, up to one quarter immigration-related, about one-fifth white collar crimes.He said he can't discuss some terrorism-related cases because they are classified. But of those that are public, ""I don't remember anything of national prominence. They were mostly garden-variety laundering schemes distantly related to terror financing.""But Mr. Spencer said that was beside the point.""I would much rather have somebody who has John's level of thoughtfulness and intelligence and commitment to carrying out our best interests in an ethical, proactive way than have someone who spent 24 hours a day for 30 or 40 years on national security issues who doesn't have those characteristics,"" Mr. Spencer said.In July, Mr. Ratcliffe's teased nomination foundered after it emerged that he had said during his 2016 campaign and on his website that he tried suspects in a high-profile terrorism financing case. In fact he investigated side issues related to an initial mistrial that he did not prosecute. He did not handle a successful second trial either.The case, United States v. Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, was one of the government's most prominent efforts to shut down funding of terrorist organizations in the decade after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. A Muslim charity had been sending money to Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza. But Mr. Ratcliffe played no part in the substance of the case, which was prosecuted in a different district, said three former government lawyers and a former senior F.B.I. official directly involved.Mr. Ratcliffe has worked to correct his inflated claims, including deleting a 2015 news release on his House website that said ""he convicted individuals funneling money to Hamas,"" and a line from another part of the website stating that he ""put terrorists in prison.""Mr. Ratcliffe served as interim U.S. attorney for Texas's Eastern District for less than year, between the departure of one presidential appointee in 2007 and the arrival of another.In 2008, he coordinated an immigration raid on Pilgrim's Pride, a chicken processor, in which 280 foreign nationals were arrested at plants in five states. During his 2016 congressional campaign, he said, ""I am opposed to amnesty -- period. But don't just take my word on it. Ask any of the over 300 illegal aliens I arrested in a single day.""In fact, 45 foreign nationals were arrested at the Pilgrim's Pride plant in Texas that day, according to local news reports, by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.After President Barack Obama took office in 2009, Mr. Ratcliffe joined Mr. Ashcroft to form Ashcroft Sutton & Ratcliffe, a law firm working on corporate governance and regulatory issues.In 2014, Mr. Ratcliffe mounted a successful primary challenge for the House seat held by a 91-year-old fellow Republican, Ralph Hall. Though Mr. Ratcliffe initially ran as a Tea Party deficit hawk, Mr. Trump won 76 percent of his district, and he followed the president's lead as the federal deficit surged.""I don't have a whole lot of experience walking into the Oval Office and negotiating with a president,"" Mr. Ratcliffe told The Dallas Morning News, after a White House meeting with Mr. Trump about efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. ""This is why I ran for Congress. I wanted a seat at the table on the national and international issues of the day.""Mr. Trump initially said he wanted Mr. Ratcliffe for the intelligence job after he impressed the president by berating the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III for five minutes on live television.""You managed to violate every principle and the most sacred of traditions about prosecutors not offering extra prosecutorial analysis about potential crimes that aren't charged,"" Mr. Ratcliffe told Mr. Mueller, a former F.B.I. director, theatrically slamming the Mueller report onto the table.But Mr. Ratcliffe has one of the worst attendance records on the intelligence committee, attending only about half of its closed-door proceedings, according to people familiar with the matter. He missed a contentious classified briefing on 2020 election security in February, when panel members grilled intelligence officers on Russian interference. When the panel held a closed-door hearing on the classified intelligence budget, Mr. Ratcliffe dipped in for just a few minutes and asked no questions. His defenders note that, as one of the few members who has sat on four committees, he often has conflicts.The White House has grown skeptical of some of the analysis coming from the intelligence community, believing ""a few bad apples"" inject political bias and manipulate reports to undermine the president or his policies, according to one intelligence official. Mr. Trump wants an intelligence director who will root these officers out. Mr. Ratcliffe also believes intelligence has become politicized.But to many current and former intelligence officers, the administration's effort to depoliticize the office amounts to exactly the opposite. Some former intelligence officers bristle at suggestions that political opinion shapes intelligence analysis.Some intelligence officials believe facts and nuanced assessments are falling prey to partisanship, with the Trump administration and its congressional allies eager to play down Russian interference in the 2020 election, for example, and congressional Democrats keen to highlight Moscow's influence operations.A partisan intelligence director, whether Mr. Ratcliffe or Mr. Grenell, heightens those concerns. Douglas H. Wise, a retired C.I.A. senior officer, said by nominating Mr. Ratcliffe, the president had ""clearly prioritized unwavering political loyalty"" over deep intelligence experience.""Trump depends on that brand of loyalty because he can't manage the agencies by himself,"" Mr. Wise said. ""He must have a loyal consigliere to keep the intelligence community agency heads in line and be the firewall between himself and inconvenient intelligence.""Kitty Bennett contributed research.PhotographRepresentative John Ratcliffe, Republican of Texas, was again nominated by President Trump to be director of national intelligence.

| Jump to first hitThey're confident, for perhaps the first time in his presidency, that the experts on call aren't out to sabotage the president.In the small town of Jonesborough, Tenn., nestled in the Appalachian Mountains, the Parent Teacher Association group text chat normally lights up with news of school dances and car-pooling schedules. Its main focus now is a global pandemic.Kerrie Aistrop, a 39-year-old mother of two, and her fellow moms exchange death-toll updates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, thought-provoking tweets and a bit of gallows humor. ""After seeing how the public panics over coronavirus, I can see why the government would never tell us about Aliens,"" reads one shared post.As people in the group have taken an all-or-nothing approach to the virus, either stocking up on toilet paper or writing the epidemic off entirely, Ms. Aistrop, a Republican and pharmaceutical sales representative, has struggled to find a middle ground for news on the ongoing crisis. And so she is relying on her go-to trusted source: President Trump.Unlike many in the G.O.P., Ms. Aistrop doesn't wholly subscribe to the notion of the mainstream news media being out to antagonize the president. When her town's state House G.O.P. representative, Micah Van Huss, filed a resolution in January to officially recognize CNN and The Washington Post as ""fake news,"" she was ""embarrassed.""But in this moment, even she doesn't feel that she can trust the media to present the pandemic's full picture.""No matter what outlet you go to about this,"" she said, ""somebody is always taking a side.""Much of Mr. Trump's success has been fueled by his supporters' distrust of career government officials. Yet as coronavirus cases multiply, many of those same supporters find themselves placing their faith in institutions like the C.D.C. -- confident for perhaps the first time in Mr. Trump's tenure that the experts on call aren't out to sabotage the president.In conversations over the course of the past week, as the news and administration action on the virus moved quickly, Mr. Trump's supporters overwhelmingly have said they trust the president and they trust whom he trusts. They are not, in large part, completely dismissive of the virus, the way some right-wing media outlets have been. But they are comforted because they see the president as a bulwark against outright panic, working with business leaders and experts from within a bureaucracy that both the president and many Republicans still distrust.""I feel like sometimes the decisions he makes are for his voters, and now it's about what's best for the American people,"" Ms. Aistrop said. ""I think he's really looking to our government agencies to take the lead on this, he's listening to them on what to do, and his No. 1 goal is to keep us safe.""While polling indicates that most Democrats take a sharply negative view of the president and his handling of the virus, and that some Republicans share concerns about Mr. Trump's performance as well, there are no signs at this point that the epidemic has cut deeply into the bedrock support that he enjoys among his base, even in places where infection rates are high and populations are most at risk.Lee Green, a 59-year-old who lives in the Florida retirement community of The Villages and leads the Jewish Conservatives Club there, said she typically gets her news from Facebook, where she is subscribed to updates from outlets like The Daily Wire and The Jerusalem Post. But on Wednesday she struggled to understand why, if the virus was indeed the equivalent of a ""bad flu,"" schools were closing and events were being canceled.Now, she relies on the C.D.C. website for updates. ""I don't see them as political hacks,"" she explained.Ms. Green is confident in the C.D.C., in large part because she believes Mr. Trump is, too. Later in the week, after the president declared a national emergency over the pandemic, her confidence that Mr. Trump was leaning on experts to do what was best for Americans had only soared.""I'm actually even more impressed after today's press briefing,"" she said on Friday, after the president spoke in the Rose Garden, with top health officials and C.E.O.s. ""I voted for Trump because he's a problem solver. And initially he wanted to be super optimistic about everything, but when the experts told him this was a really big deal, he instantly took action.""Mr. Trump and public health officials have often contradicted one another when speaking publicly about the virus. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testified before Congress on Thursday about the severity of the outbreak, a day after the president had assured people that the virus would ""go away.""But when many Americans consume their news in snippets, B-roll footage of the president speaking with agency heads in the Roosevelt Room can be enough to cement impressions of coordination, unity, transparency.Voters said they were comforted watching the recent spate of televised briefings at the White House. They saw the president and vice president standing behind the podium, surrounded by heads of agencies -- the sheer presence of the experts seeming to confirm that Mr. Trump was communicating their findings accurately.""It's more of a feeling than the actual data,"" Mary Lou Drake, a Trump supporter from The Villages, said on Wednesday. ""It's a feeling of trust in these people that they're working hard, they're doing what they can, they're not shielding information, and they're putting out all the information they have at the moment.""With four children ranging in age from preschool to sixth grade, Rachel Losey is lucky if she catches CBS radio in the morning and a Tucker Carlson segment at night. The 38-year-old stay-at-home mom, who lives in Battle Creek, Mich., feels that based on what she has heard, the president and his administration have things under control.""I appreciate what Donald Trump is doing, saying, 'Yeah, there's a problem, we're taking care of it, but don't panic. It's going to be OK, don't freak out about it,""' she said.That sense of calm, even levity, about the virus permeated places like Battle Creek late in the week, even as the first cases were confirmed in Michigan and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency.""From what I can see, the president has surrounded himself with people whose main objective is to contain this without causing unnecessary worry,"" said Ryan Leonard, a 49-year-old real estate agent who volunteers for the Calhoun County G.O.P.The result, he added, is that beyond what he describes as ""common-sense"" measures like more frequent hand-washing, ""people around here aren't taking it all that seriously.""Mr. Leonard said that his Facebook feed was mostly filled with jokes about the virus, such as an image of Hillary Clinton captioned, ""If the coronavirus was a person ...""But while many Trump supporters have found a new regard for experts and expertise, their disdain for the media, and what they view as unfair treatment of Mr. Trump, is more trenchant than ever.Mr. Leonard said on Thursday that he thought the severity of the virus was a media-spawned ""hoax.""""The opinion from the conservative channels is that the mainstream media is making a manufactured sort of crisis,"" he said. ""We haven't contained the common flu, we haven't contained the common cold, but since the president hasn't contained this, he's bad.""""And you know, honestly, they lost the election, and then impeachment failed, all of these things,"" Mr. Leonard added. ""I think they're just grasping at straws to try and make our president look incompetent when he's the best president we've ever had.""Indeed, as these Trump supporters see it, in the same way that the Mueller probe, impeachment or any other scandal in this administration has failed to bring down the president, coronavirus -- stock-market free falls and all -- will seem a distant memory by November.That feeling persists among some voters even as Mr. Trump's recent actions, such as declaring a national state of emergency, seem to signal that his administration views the pandemic as more than a bad flu. Yet some of his supporters remain firm that the president's opponents are using the outbreak for their gain.On Tuesday, a day before the World Health Organization declared the new coronavirus a global pandemic, Mark Hammond, a Republican from La Plata, Md., logged into Facebook and marked himself ""safe from whatever it is the media wants me to be afraid of today.""""It's a scare tactic,"" he said, of media coverage of the crisis. ""Altogether it's part of a Democratic long game.""Mr. Hammond, who has a home remodeling company and runs a Facebook group called ""Patriots Against Impeachment,"" said he attended this year's Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, D.C., where an attendee tested positive for the virus. When asked if he was worried about becoming infected or about the pandemic generally, Mr. Hammond was clear: ""110 percent, no.""""I have not changed one thing in my daily life,"" he said, adding that for the past decade he has kept a ""ready bag"" and six months' worth of supplies on hand, just in case an emergency arises.For many Trump supporters, this moment is unsettling -- though not linked, in their mind, to the president himself.Jeff Schumacher, a 42-year-old realtor, lives in suburban Seattle, so far one of the areas in the nation hardest hit by the virus. He is juggling his work and his three children being at home after schools closed, and is watching supplies dwindle in stores near his home in Everett.He voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 and plans to vote for him again. He thinks he is handling the outbreak better than other presidents of either party would have.""He has a business approach perspective to his management,"" Mr. Schumacher said. ""This is a virus. This is not a Trump problem, it's a world problem.""PhotographPresident Trump in the Rose Garden on Friday afternoon. His news conference was closely watched by his supporters, and one said she was ""even more impressed"" at his handling of the crisis. Rachel Losey, left, said his leadership has kept her calm.

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump's former campaign adviser was convicted of lying to Congress and trying to block a witness in order to impede an investigation into the 2016 Trump campaign.Federal prosecutors asked a judge on Monday to sentence Roger J. Stone Jr., President Trump's longtime friend and former campaign adviser, to up to nine years in prison for lying to Congress and tampering with a witness to prevent investigators from discovering how the 2016 Trump campaign tried to benefit from stolen Democratic documents.Mr. Stone, 67, deserved seven to nine years behind bars because he threatened the witness with bodily harm, interfered with a congressional investigation and then, after he was charged in a federal indictment, repeatedly flouted the orders of the judge overseeing his case, the prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memorandum.In a multiyear scheme, the prosecutors said, Mr. Stone lied under oath, forged documents and engaged in ""a relentless and elaborate campaign to silence"" the witness because he could have exposed his lies to the House Intelligence Committee. When flattery failed, they said, he harassed the witness and even threatened his life and that of his dog. Even if the witness believed Mr. Stone would personally never injure him, he feared that he could inspire others to do so, they said.""Stone's actions were not a one-off mistake in judgment. Nor were his false statements made in the heat of the moment. They were nowhere close to that,"" the prosecutors argued. ""Stone's conduct over the past two years shows the low regard in which he holds the House Intelligence Committee's investigation and this very criminal case.""In their own memorandum, Mr. Stone's lawyers argued that the prosecutors had misconstrued harmless messages from Mr. Stone to the witness, a New York radio host named Randy Credico, as genuine threats. They argued that Mr. Stone should be sentenced to less than 15 months in prison for the seven felonies he was found guilty of in November.The evidence in Mr. Stone's jury trial showed that in the months before the election, he strove to obtain emails that Russia had stolen from Democratic Party computers and funneled to WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks then released the emails at strategic moments to damage Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump's Democratic opponent.Prosecutors claimed that Mr. Stone used every chance he had to brief the Trump campaign about whatever he picked up about WikiLeaks' plans. But in September 2017, he told the House Intelligence Committee that he never described to anyone involved in the Trump campaign his conversations with an intermediary to WikiLeaks. To cover up his lies, he urged Mr. Credico to take the Fifth Amendment rather than testify before the committee.""Stone's criminal conduct was not an act of desperation. He is a man of substantial means, and he has enjoyed a modicum of fame from his years of being a political adviser and confidant to powerful politicians,"" the prosecutors wrote. ""His conduct was undertaken purposefully, by someone who knew exactly what he was doing.""But the defense lawyers argued that Mr. Stone not only never intended to threaten Mr. Credico, but created no real obstacle for federal investigators. While Mr. Credico refused to testify before Congress, he cooperated fully with the special counsel's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, they argued. And he in fact had no incriminating information about the Trump campaign or WikiLeaks, they said.Mr. Credico himself submitted a letter asking the judge not to send Mr. Stone to prison, saying incarceration damaged both prisoners and their families. While he stood by his testimony during the trial, he wrote, ""I never in any way felt that Stone himself posed a direct physical threat to me or my dog.""On the eve of the jury's verdict in his trial in November, Mr. Stone appeared to appeal to the president for a pardon, using as his proxy Alex Jones, a right-wing conspiracy theorist who runs the website Infowars. Although Mr. Trump has said nothing about pardoning Mr. Stone, he quickly criticized the verdict, suggesting that prosecutors and F.B.I. officials had themselves lied during the Russia investigation.Prosecutors characterized Mr. Stone's apparent appeal for a pardon as part of a pattern of violations of gag orders imposed by Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the United States District Court in Washington, who oversaw his case. They argued that Mr. Stone's behavior before and after he was criminally charged underscored the need for a prison term to teach him respect for the law.The prosecutors also stressed that Mr. Stone had threatened the judge herself in February 2019, when he posted a photo of her with an image of what appeared to be the cross hairs of a gun next to her head on social media. During a hearing on the matter, the prosecutors said, Mr. Stone ""openly lied to this court about matters directly affecting the integrity of these proceedings.""The prosecutors' request that Mr. Stone be imprisoned contrasted sharply with their recent plea for leniency in the case of Rick Gates, Mr. Trump's former deputy campaign chairman who also helped manage his inauguration. In recognition of his cooperation with the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, prosecutors asked that Mr. Gates be sentenced to probation for his part in a criminal financial conspiracy and for lying to federal prosecutors.Judge Jackson, who also oversaw that case, sentenced Mr. Gates in December to 45 days in jail.PhotographRoger J.

| Jump to first hitSenators Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney seem open to witnesses in President Trump's impeachment trial. With one more Republican, Democrats could commandeer the proceedings.WASHINGTON -- The Capitol math is clear: Democrats need only four Republican votes to force the Senate to subpoena witnesses like John R. Bolton, the former White House national security adviser, to testify in President Trump's impeachment trial. Three have signaled they may be open to doing so: Senators Mitt Romney, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski.That leaves Democrats searching for an elusive fourth vote.The question of whether four Republicans will defect -- and if so, who -- looms large in the Capitol as the Senate prepares to receive articles of impeachment from the House on Wednesday, prompting the third presidential impeachment trial in American history. If they did, Democrats could effectively commandeer the Senate floor during the proceeding and defy Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, by moving to call witnesses.That could derail Mr. McConnell's hopes to secure a quick acquittal of Mr. Trump with little debate, drastically altering the course of the trial -- and potentially, of Mr. Trump's presidency.""I can't predict to whether we'll have witnesses or not,"" Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, said Tuesday. ""At first everyone said no, McConnell seemed to rule the roost. Now we're having some people entertain it, but you don't know what's going to happen. So we're in better shape than we were a few weeks ago, but there's no certainties here at all.""In recent days, Mr. Schumer, Mr. McConnell and members of Mr. Trump's team have been privately obsessed with the possibility that a fourth Republican could emerge and tip the math in Democrats' direction, even as all of them concede they are unsure who that would be.So far, only Mr. Romney has said explicitly that he wants Mr. Bolton to appear. Ms. Collins, who is facing a tough re-election fight in Maine, and Ms. Murkowski have been a bit cagier, saying that they want the Senate to vote on whether to have witnesses or documents, but only after both sides present their cases.""Am I curious about what Ambassador Bolton would have to say? Yes, I am,"" Ms. Murkowski told reporters, according to Alaska Public Radio. But she said she would not ""prejudge"" the need for him to testify until after the cases are presented.Ms. Collins, whose reputation for independence took a hit in Maine when she voted to confirm Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, is under pressure from all sides. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to the Senate, has created a website -- WhatChangedSusan.com -- spotlighting her push for witnesses during the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton.""It's time for Senator Collins to commit to a fair process, stand up to Mitch McConnell, and demand a proper trial in the Senate,"" the website declared.But Ms. Collins has suggested all along that she will do just that.""I tend to like information,"" she said on Monday, adding that she would not be pushing for the option to call witnesses ""if I did not anticipate at the end of hearing the case presented, and the Q. and A., that there might be a need for more information.""The names of other Republican senators -- including Cory Gardner, who is in a tough 2020 race in Colorado, and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who is respectful of Senate institutions and is retiring and thus freer to vote his conscience -- have also been raised as possibilities. Mr. Gardner can ill afford to break with Mr. Trump.But Mr. Alexander is of genuine concern to the White House, according to a senior administration official, who insisted on anonymity to characterize the perspective of Mr. Trump's team. On Monday, he appeared to join the Collins-Murkowski wait-and-see camp.""We're taking an oath to be impartial,"" Mr. Alexander told reporters in the Capitol, ""and that to me means we have a constitutional duty to hear the case, ask our questions and then decide whether we want additional evidence in terms of documents or witnesses.""After the House voted last month to impeach the president on charges of high crimes and misdemeanors in connection with his campaign to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, Mr. Schumer issued a list of four witnesses Democrats want to call. Those include Mr. Bolton and Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff.Mr. Bolton has since said he would be willing to testify if the Senate issued a subpoena.Democrats also want to subpoena documents, including administration emails showing that the White House ordered the suspension of military aid to Ukraine just 90 minutes after a phone call in which Mr. Trump asked that country's president to investigate Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, Hunter Biden.Mr. Trump, who has vacillated between saying he wants witnesses and saying he wants a speedy trial, has at times floated the idea of calling Hunter Biden to testify. If Democrats succeed in calling Mr. Bolton or other witnesses, it is likely that Republicans would push to call the Bidens. On Tuesday, Mr. McConnell met with a small group of Republican senators to explore that idea of ""witness reciprocity,"" according to two people familiar with the discussions.The question is not going to be settled immediately. Mr. McConnell has indicated that he has the support of 53 Republicans -- two more than the 51 he needs for a majority -- to adopt an organizing resolution governing the first phase of the trial, in which both sides will present their cases and senators may ask questions. That will take roughly two weeks.Mr. McConnell has said he wants the resolution to adhere closely to the one used in the Clinton trial, which specified that once the first phase was complete, the Senate would vote on whether to call witnesses. Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri and a member of leadership, said on Tuesday that he expected the resolution governing the trial would also include that language.For Republicans in difficult re-election races -- with the possible exception of Ms. Collins, who is her own brand in Maine -- the political calculations are complex. Senators Joni Ernst of Iowa, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Martha McSally of Arizona and Mr. Gardner all face tough contests in states that are not nearly as conservative as they used to be.Democrats are unlikely to support them no matter what they do, and alienating Mr. Trump could be disastrous for them.""This is Cory's problem, or challenge: There's a very restless Republican base in Colorado and Cory cannot afford to alienate that base because he cannot afford any defections from the base in a general election,"" said Richard Wadhams, a Republican strategist in Colorado who is close to Mr. Gardner.""He's in a very vulnerable position right now in the Senate election,"" Mr. Wadhams added, ""but believe me, it is much more dangerous for him to appear not to be supporting Trump than it is to be supporting McConnell and the president in Colorado.""The pressure on Mr. Gardner mounted on Monday when the Lincoln Project, a group of Republicans that describes itself as ""dedicated to defeating President Trump and Trumpism,"" targeted him in a brutal advertisement that described the Colorado senator as ""just another Trump servant -- weak, frightened, impotent -- a small man, terrified of a political bully.""""Colorado voters want a fair trial in the Senate and honest leadership,"" the ad said. ""Either do your job, or Colorado will find someone who will.""In the Capitol on Tuesday, Mr. Gardner was making himself scarce. When Republicans wrapped up a luncheon featuring a discussion of trial procedure, he zipped out a back door and headed for a little-used elevator, avoiding a throng of waiting reporters.""I'm sorry, he's got to get going,"" an aide to Mr. Gardner told a reporter who followed him, as the elevator doors opened and the senator slipped inside. Then Mr. Gardner jumped in, begging off any discussion of whether he could be the elusive fourth vote who could upend hopes of a quick acquittal of Mr. Trump.""We don't have the articles yet,"" he said, ""and I'm not going to speculate.""Catie Edmondson contributed reporting from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.Catie Edmondson contributed reporting from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.PhotographMitt Romney is the only Republican in the Senate so far to say he wants John R. Bolton, a former national security adviser, to testify at the coming impeachment trial. Two other Republicans, Susan Collins, center, and Lisa Murkowski, have said they were open to it.

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump was feted with music, dancers and more than 100,000 cheering attendees -- if not the 10 million he says he was promised.AHMEDABAD, India -- President Trump began a two-day visit to India by joining Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a campaign-style rally in a 110,000-seat cricket stadium that illustrated the populist bond between the two men and impressed a president who revels in spectacle.""America loves India. America respects India,"" Mr. Trump said. ""And America will always be faithful and loyal friends to the Indian people.""The ""Namaste Trump"" rally, a daylong affair featuring popular singers, dancers and pounding music, took place under a blazing sun in the city's Motera Stadium, which India calls the largest of its kind in the world. It was an unabashed homage to Mr. Trump, whose name and image appeared in dozens of banners and billboards throughout the stadium.Mr. Trump looked out with satisfaction at the grand display, and said it had made a lasting impression on him.""We will always remember this remarkable hospitality. We will remember it forever,"" Mr. Trump said to loud cheers, as his wife, Melania, sat nearby. ""From this day onward, India will always hold a special place in our hearts.""But even as he name-checked famous cricket players and Bollywood stars, Mr. Trump betrayed unfamiliarity with the country -- and even his immediate location -- when he stumbled over several pronunciations, including those of Ahmedabad itself, as well as Gujarat, the state it anchors and Mr. Modi's political home base.And although Mr. Trump said with satisfaction that 125,000 people had turned out to see him, more than one third of the crowd appeared to leave before the end of his nearly 30-minute remarks, and another third was gone by the time Mr. Modi spoke after him.The event was the mirror image of a ""Howdy, Modi!"" rally the two men held at a football stadium in Houston last September, and catered to Mr. Trump's taste for a giant crowd. It also made vivid an image the leaders are jointly cultivating as larger-than-life, unapologetically brash figures leading their countries to bright new futures -- even as critics call them mutual enablers in parallel assaults on democratic and religious freedoms.""Two dynamic personalities, one momentous occasion,"" declared one billboard in Ahmedabad, highlighting a personal dynamic that, for now, overshadows more substantive hangups in the U.S.-India relationship. Those included Mr. Trump's efforts to strike a peace agreement with the Taliban and slow progress toward a trade deal.Mr. Trump said that he and Mr. Modi would eventually be making ""very, very major"" trade deals, but added that they are in the ""early stages of discussion."" Mr. Modi was ""a very tough negotiator,"" he joked.But that was about as critical as Mr. Trump got in remarks that hailed Mr. Modi for his ""landslide"" 2019 re-election, which Mr. Trump noted was the largest democratic election on Earth. Making no mention of a growing backlash against what critics call Mr. Modi's anti-Muslim Hindu nationalism, Mr. Trump praised India for its unity and echoed the Indian leader's own stump speeches by noting anti-poverty efforts that have provided more electricity, cooking gas and toilets to rural Indians.It was further evidence that Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi have developed a personal bond, or at least a political partnership, one Mr. Modi has skilfully created with the glue of flattery. Before departing from Washington on Sunday, Mr. Trump told reporters that his appearance here would be ""the biggest event they've ever had in India. That's what the prime minister told me."" (The rally was likely not even the biggest Indian turnout for an American president: Dwight D. Eisenhower drew a crowd of one million during a 1959 visit to New Delhi, according to an Associated Press report at the time.)Onstage, the two men hugged repeatedly, and Mr. Modi lavished his guest with praise.""President Trump thinks big, and the world knows what he has done to realize the American dream,"" Mr. Modi said to the cheering crowd.Although Ahmedabad did not deliver the 10 million well-wishers that Mr. Trump has also said Mr. Modi promised to turn out -- the entire city's population is less than 6 million, and television images suggested tens of thousands, not millions in the streets -- the city feted him with costumed musicians and dancers, and even a marching band on camels.Motera Stadium -- formally known as Sardar Patel Stadium, and still partly under construction -- was full at the outset of Mr. Trump's remarks, with tens of thousands sitting for hours in temperatures well above 80 degrees. Some Indians wore Modi masks and waved American flags while they danced to the popular Indian musicians who warmed up the crowd.Mr. Trump departed from the event for Agra and a sunset tour of the Taj Mahal. From there he heads to New Delhi, where he will meet with Mr. Modi before attending a state banquet.Major roads in the three cities were teeming with giant posters and billboards of Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi, along with inspiring slogans trumpeting the U.S.-India relationship.""World's oldest democracy meets world's largest democracy,"" proclaimed one. But skeptics of the two men say they have each undermined democratic traditions by demonizing immigrants, promoting nationalism and seeking to suppress media freedoms.Mr. Trump has shown little public concern for actions by Mr. Modi that have drawn international condemnation, including abruptly revoking the statehood of predominantly Muslim Kashmir and backing a law establishing a religious test for new migrants that critics call evidence of plans to turn India into a Hindu-centric state whose 200 million Muslims would be second-class citizens.Sectarian-themed clashes erupted in northeast New Delhi on Monday, as people for and against Mr. Modi's new immigration law fought in the streets. A policeman was killed amid rising tensions between Hindus and Muslims in that area, officials said.Still, those contentious issues went unmentioned during Monday's event, although Trump administration official told reporters on Friday that Mr. Trump would talk during his visit ""about our shared tradition of democracy and religious freedom both in his public remarks and then certainly in private."" Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi are scheduled to hold a news conference in New Delhi on Tuesday.Mr. Trump drew some of the day's loudest cheers when he mentioned India's rival and neighbor, Pakistan, saying that he was working with that country ""to crack down on the terrorist organizations"" that operate along its border with India, and which New Delhi sees as a mortal threat""Every nation has the right to secure and controlled borders. The United States and India are committed to working together to stop terrorists and to fight their ideology,"" Mr. Trump said.Mr. Trump, who tweeted good wishes to India in Hindi before and after his arrival, was joined on his flight there by his wife Melania, his daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner. Before arriving at the stadium, Mr. Trump removed his shoes and donned a traditional scarf for a visit to an ashram where the former Indian leader Mohandas K. Gandhi once lived.Ahmedabad is the biggest city and the main business hub in Gujarat, Mr. Modi's home and political base. Many of the most influential Indian-Americans are also originally from Gujarat, and a growing source of political and financial support for Mr. Trump as he heads toward re-election. Mr. Trump said on Monday that four million Indian-Americans live in the United States, including ""titans of business"" and ""pioneers of science.""Gujarat is also the place where Mr. Modi's critics say that he, as chief minister of the state, played an unforgivable role during a wave of sectarian violence in 2002 that left more than 1,000 people dead -- almost 800 of whom were Muslims killed by Hindu mobs.Mr. Modi has been widely accused of at least tacitly supporting the violence. Much of the killing was done by members of his political party and other Hindu nationalist groups. Many witnesses said police officers did not intervene and in many cases joined in the killing.Mr. Modi denies those accusations. But the George W. Bush administration was suspicious enough of Mr. Modi's role to ban him in 2005 from visiting the United States.When he became prime minister in the spring of 2014, the travel ban was lifted, and later that year, Mr. Modi made his first triumphant visit to the United States, where he had a private dinner with President Obama.Mr. Trump is popular in India, where 2019 polling by the Pew Research Center found 56 percent of citizens expressed confidence in him to handle world affairs -- one of just a half-dozen nations to register a majority on that question. In many other countries, he is more apt to draw crowds of protesters than admirers. Attendees at Monday's rally seemed dazzled.""If they don't make any deals, that's fine,"" said Mahesh Banker, a 50-year-old doctor who attended the rally with friends. ""But India is shining, and America recognizes that, and that's all that matters.""Another attendee, Harsh Patel, a 21-year-old from Gujarat who now lives in Canada, drew comparisons between the two leaders. ""Modi is a strong leader, passionate about his people, and he works for them,"" he said. ""He's unorthodox, and doesn't care what people think. Kind of like Trump.""In addition to hanging hundreds of banners and billboards, India's government hurried in recent days to make cosmetic improvements to all three of the cities Mr. Trump is visiting. In Ahmedabad, a new wall appeared that happened to conceal a slum.And in Agra on Sunday, a day before Mr. Trump's arrival, workers were busy paving streets in and around the Taj Mahal compound. ""Trump is coming!"" volunteered one worker filling cracks in a sidewalk leading to the famous structure.Local media reports chronicled efforts by officials to chase away the hundreds of monkeys who perennially roam around the structure and which can be hostile to people. No monkeys were visible on the grounds during Mr. Trump's visit.Reporting was contributed by Maria Abi-Habib and Hari Kumar from Ahmedabad, India; and by Jeffrey Gettleman, Shalini Venugopal and Suhasini Raj from New Delhi.PhotographAttendees at the ""Namaste Trump"" rally in Ahmedabad, India, on Monday.

| Jump to first hitThe localities that filed the lawsuit are in the district of Representative Jeff Van Drew, who just switched parties and pledged support for President Trump.On the eve of a visit by President Trump to New Jersey for a campaign rally, his administration has unexpectedly intervened on behalf of local officials in the state in a heated immigration dispute.The Justice Department on Friday joined a lawsuit that seeks to overturn a state directive that has been in effect for nearly a year that limits how much local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration authorities.The move comes amid the Trump administration's escalating efforts against so-called sanctuary policies around the country, but experts said the timing could suggest it has as much to do with politics as with immigration.The two counties that filed the suit are in the district of Representative Jeff Van Drew, a freshman centrist who was elected as a Democrat but recently became a Republican after voting against impeaching Mr. Trump.In changing parties -- and pledging ""undying support"" for Mr. Trump -- Mr. Van Drew roiled the political landscape in the southern part of the state and raised the stakes for his re-election campaign this year.Amy Kennedy, the wife of former Representative Patrick Kennedy, part of the political dynasty, announced this month that she would join the crowded race against Mr. Van Drew, releasing a video that included images of him meeting with the president in the Oval Office after his switch. Mr. Trump announced that same day he would be holding a rally in New Jersey on Tuesday.The Justice Department's decision to side with the two counties may signal that Mr. Van Drew -- who will speak at Mr. Trump's rally in Wildwood, N.J. -- intends to make immigration a central plank in his re-election campaign, just as Mr. Trump has done.Mr. Van Drew did not immediately respond to requests for comment.John J. Farmer Jr., a former New Jersey attorney general and director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, said politics did seem to play a part in the timing of the move. ""It should be seen as an attempt by the president to inspire his base in South Jersey, where he does have support, and as an attempt to bolster Van Drew's newfound status as a Republican,"" he said.Mr. Farmer said the federal officials' involvement in the suit should also be viewed in light of an ""unusually high"" volume of litigation between Gov. Philip D. Murphy's administration and Mr. Trump's Justice Department. ""Completely different world views colliding, that is what is happening here,"" Mr. Farmer said.Mr. Trump's forthcoming appearance at the Wildwood Convention Center will be his first campaign rally in the state as president, though he frequently has visited his golf courses there.New Jersey has tended recently to lean Democratic, voting overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton in 2016. The Democratic Party also controls both the governor's office and the Legislature. But the rally will take place in a more conservative area in the southern part of the state that is more friendly to Republicans.The event is expected to draw thousands of Trump supporters, including from out of state. Mr. Van Drew told Fox News that 100,000 tickets had been requested for the rally at the venue, which holds 7,400 people.At issue in the lawsuit is the New Jersey attorney general's Immigrant Trust Directive, which the Justice Department is asking to be declared unconstitutional. (The federal officials are not a party in the lawsuit, but will be supporting the counties' efforts.)The Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In an emailed statement, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign declined to comment.The state attorney general, Gurbir S. Grewal, said in a statement on Saturday that he was ""deeply disappointed"" that federal officials ""have suddenly chosen to challenge"" the directive in court.Mr. Grewal said the directive had played an important role in ""ensuring that victims and witnesses come forward and report crimes to law enforcement without fear of deportation.""He added: ""The federal government's efforts to coerce states into implementing its immigration agenda have failed repeatedly in the past, and we'll respond to their latest efforts in court at the appropriate time.""Issued in November 2018, the state attorney general's directive laid out rules limiting the extent to which local and state law enforcement can assist federal civil immigration enforcement efforts. It restricts law enforcement from sharing information with federal authorities and prohibits asking people about their immigration status.It allows law enforcement officers to turn over undocumented immigrants charged with certain crimes to United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, but only if enforcement agents pick up the migrants on the day of their release.Cape May County and Ocean County filed separate lawsuits last fall opposing the directive, but those lawsuits were consolidated before the Justice Department got involved in the suit.State Senator Michael Testa Jr., a Republican who is one of the lawyers who filed the lawsuit on behalf of Cape May County, said he had not been consulted about the Justice Department's decision.But he criticized the limits the directive places on local law enforcement officers' ability to cooperate with ICE.""I really don't understand why our attorney general would not want to have coordination between law enforcement agencies at the county level, with ICE, when an individual who is here in this country illegally has in fact committed a crime,"" said Mr. Testa, who is an honorary chairman of Mr. Trump's re-election campaign in New Jersey.The Justice Department has repeatedly spoken out against what it calls sanctuary policies around the country and has attempted to cut off federal funding to jurisdictions that have laws limiting cooperation with ICE.It is not the first time it has gotten involved in legal challenges to such policies under Mr. Trump. In 2018, the Justice Department unsuccessfully filed its own suit challenging California's sanctuary laws. A federal judge largely ruled against the administration's case in July of that year, saying that the state never violated the Constitution by passing its own laws. The department lost again on appeal last spring.In New Jersey, most local law enforcement officers have supported the attorney general's directive, which went into effect last March, saying that it has helped reassure immigrants that they can interact with law enforcement without risking deportation.In Bridgeton, a rural community in southern New Jersey that is home to many Latino immigrants, the police have been conducting a monthslong search for Dulce Maria Alavez, a 5-year-old who disappeared from a park in September. Michael A. Gaimari Sr., the police chief in Bridgeton, said he was ""disappointed"" to learn that the Justice Department had joined the challenge to the statewide directive.""We have been trying to break down the barriers to get the information we need to investigate cases like this one -- that becomes difficult when there's fear,"" he said.Activists also lamented that the federal government was throwing its weight behind the legal challenge to the directive.""Before the directive, immigrants in New Jersey feared even the slightest contact with law enforcement could lead to family separations,"" said Sara Cullinane, the director of Make The Road Action in New Jersey, an advocacy group. ""Since the directive went into effect, we have seen that trust has been significantly repaired.""Tracey Tully and Katie Benner contributed reporting.PhotographPresident Trump with Representative Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, who just became a Republican.

| Jump to first hitFor three years, President Trump's winter visits to Mar-a-Lago, his private club, have allowed him time to combine his personal and presidential business. But the juxtaposition this year was something quite different.PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Beneath wind-swept palm trees and gilded chandeliers, President Trump dined with Rush Limbaugh and congratulated Keith Hernandez, the Mets announcer and former first baseman, on his wedding. He consulted with his national security and campaign advisers while basking in 80-degree weather, and, as always, he tweeted.He also authorized a military strike that has roiled the Middle East and is likely to endure as one of the most consequential acts of his presidency.For three years, Mr. Trump's winter visits to Mar-a-Lago, his private club, have allowed him time to combine his personal and presidential business, often in the midst of the club's wealthy members and his adoring friends.But the jarring juxtapositions this year seemed to highlight some central elements in the way Mr. Trump has governed: the little interest he has in planning beyond the day in front of him, his need for positive feedback and an unwillingness to modulate his behavior, whatever the circumstance.From the outside, the president's two-week winter vacation in Palm Beach, Fla., seemed similar to his previous long stays, except for the fact that he had recently been impeached.The days were generally marked by casual-wear trips to his nearby golf club, where he would talk with members and meet with White House advisers. The evenings were marked by elaborate dinners at Mar-a-Lago that included his family members, his campaign advisers and his national security aides.But Mr. Trump's vacation was more than the usual refuge from negative news coverage and official Washington. He was agitated by uncertainty about what comes next in the impeachment process, and expressed gnawing concerns about how much the billionaire Michael R. Bloomberg is spending on his campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination in the election that Mr. Trump hopes to win.Throughout Christmas week, the president watched the news coverage on impeachment and tweeted his frustrations with Speaker Nancy Pelosi for slowing down the process by refusing to send to the Senate the articles charging him with high crimes and misdemeanors. He spoke with advisers about what the Senate trial might look like.And there were other grievances, as well.On Sunday, Dec. 29, hours after a stabbing at the home of a rabbi in Monsey, N.Y., Mr. Trump, from his golf club in West Palm Beach, called one of his oldest acquaintances and major Jewish supporters, the cosmetics billionaire Ronald S. Lauder, to yell that Mr. Lauder should be doing more to ""support"" him, according to three people briefed on the call.Mr. Lauder, the president of the World Jewish Congress who recently started a new $25 million effort to fight anti-Semitism that employs a pollster working for Mr. Bloomberg, listened as Mr. Trump ticked off a litany of administration actions. Mr. Trump said that he had done more for Jews than any other president and that he could still lose the Jewish vote. The president never mentioned campaign contributions, but advisers and others briefed on the call said he left the clear impression that was referring to financial support.In a statement, Mr. Lauder would say only that he has had ""many candid, positive and forward-looking conversations with"" Mr. Trump, who ""deserves a great deal of support from the Jewish community for his fantastic record on Israel and his proven support of the Jewish people here at home.""Then it was time to get back to White House work, and Mr. Trump huddled with advisers offering him a range of options on how to respond to the death of an American civilian contractor killed on Dec. 27 in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base. The menu of choices included the most extreme one -- killing Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Iran's most powerful commander.On New Year's Eve, Mr. Trump hosted his annual party at Mar-a-Lago, arriving in a tuxedo with the first lady, Melania Trump, and playing M.C. to a crowd that included his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani.On Jan. 2, the president began his day at his golf club. But mindful of not appearing weak in the face the rocket attack and concerned that an assault on the American Embassy in Baghdad that United States officials said was orchestrated by Iran could have ended in devastation, Mr. Trump had already settled on a course of action.In the middle of a meeting with campaign advisers, he left the table to give the final authorization to kill General Suleimani. The president then returned, and, compartmentalizing what had just happened, resumed talking about the campaign.It was an act of enormous consequence, but the White House made no public statement for hours, though the president cryptically tweeted about what had taken place. Whatever the administration's objectives were, and whatever intelligence they had used to justify the strike, it was not being shared in any conventional fashion.Mr. Trump closely monitored reactions to his military action, taking note of who praised him publicly among Republicans and who did not, like Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host. He was encouraged by others on the Trump-friendly network.But finally, on Friday afternoon, as he was about leave on a short helicopter ride to Miami for a campaign event with evangelical supporters, he abruptly agreed to make a statement on the strike.His decision to speak came partly at the prodding of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who had jumped in to try to direct the public response.So aides draped one of the private dining rooms at Mar-a-Lago with a presidential blue cloth as a backdrop to the presidential podium. Roughly five minutes after he started talking, Mr. Trump was done.Next up was Miami, and there, at the King Jesus International Ministry, he excoriated the ""fake news,"" declared from the dais that two progressive congresswomen ""hate"" Jewish people, taunted the Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg for his faith, and said God was ""on our side.""The president's final day of vacation, Saturday, was spent at the golf club, and was punctuated by a handful of tweets.That night, Mr. Trump strolled through Mar-a-Lago, a phalanx of aides in tow, as Mr. Hernandez got married in an adjacent room, according to attendees. The president did not attend the wedding, but did offer congratulations.Some people reached out to shake his hand or just to touch his arm as he passed their tables. For the second night, Mr. Trump heard approval from club members and their guests who thought he had acted decisively.Less than 24 hours later, he began his return to Washington, where the temperature was much colder and the grind of his fourth year in office and his campaign for another term were just beginning.PhotographWith a makeshift curtain behind the presidential lectern, President Trump on Friday addressed the strike that killed the Iranian leader Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. (PHOTOGRAPH BY ERIC THAYER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)Word count: 1153Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hitRonny Jackson is one of 15 candidates in a crowded Republican primary. And the White House hasn't gone out of its way to help.WICHITA FALLS, Texas -- Dressed in cowboy boots and jeans, with an American flag pin on his lapel, Dr. Ronny L. Jackson rolled up at the Red River Harley-Davidson outpost to make his pitch to voters.""I just came from the White House,"" Dr. Jackson, the former White House physician, told the small crowd gathered upstairs from the Harley showroom. ""I've been working side by side with the president. I know all the cabinet secretaries. I have their cellphones. I know the chief of staff, the national security adviser. I can pick the phone up and I can call them. They're all friends of mine.""Dr. Jackson left the West Wing in December after rising from President Trump's physician to his unlikely pick to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs to Trump administration roadkill when he was forced to withdraw his name from consideration amid allegations related to his professional conduct.Now he's running for Congress in Texas' 13th District, one of the most conservative in the country, and his argument is simple. In a primary field of 15 anti-immigrant, anti-abortion Republicans, Dr. Jackson is betting his personal connection with the president is enough to win the Republican nomination tantamount to election.Standing alongside other candidates wearing cowboy hats and ""Make America Great Again"" caps at the forum on Thursday, Dr. Jackson pitched himself as the only one ""who can walk in the Oval Office unannounced and say, 'Sir, I need you to stop what you're doing and listen to me,' and he will stop what he's doing and listen to me.""That access, he said, would make him an unusually powerful replacement for Representative Mac Thornberry, the Republican who announced last fall he would not seek re-election after representing his district for more than a quarter of a century.But it is not clear if that connection, combined with his background as a Navy rear admiral, will be enough to help Dr. Jackson overcome some rookie mistakes as a candidate. There have been more than a few.His campaign organization, for one thing.Dr. Jackson's campaign manager, he said, is ""a horse doctor"" with a full-time job. He has one full-time staff member, a recent college graduate who is also working for free, and he has relied on his wife, Jane, to drive him around the enormous Panhandle-encompassing district, which spans 41 counties. And despite having a power Rolodex, he has never reached into it to ask the right people for help.On Friday, Dr. Jackson spent the afternoon knocking on doors in Wichita Falls, only to realize that it was a relatively futile exercise since most people weren't home. In the evening, he mingled in the bleachers at the Monarch Motor Speedway only to report back to his wife that most of spectators had driven in from Oklahoma.While waiting for the stock car race to begin, Dr. Jackson laughed when a hunk of mud spun up from the dirt track and landed in his coffee cup, a fitting end to another long day on the campaign trail where it wasn't clear if he'd made any progress.Dr. Jackson, who grew up in Levelland, Texas, returned to the Panhandle after leaving the White House and retiring from the Navy, settling in the district in Amarillo. He thought his connections to Mr. Trump and the extended Trumpworld would make him a shoo-in for the seat, people who spoke to him at the time said.But Mr. Trump, who now generally adheres to rules put in place by his political shop about whom he endorses and what races he weighs in on, has been silent about Dr. Jackson's campaign. Donald Trump Jr., whom Dr. Jackson considers a close friend, has no plans to get involved in his race or officially endorse him, an aide said. And even Rick Perry, the former energy secretary and Texas governor who encouraged him to run and then endorsed him, has not campaigned for him.Dr. Jackson is now facing an uphill battle against two well-funded and connected opponents -- Chris Ekstrom, a Dallas millionaire who recently moved to the district to run and is self-funding his campaign, and Josh Winegarner, a lobbyist who has the backing of the cattle industry he represents and Mr. Thornberry.But Dr. Jackson's connections to the Trump administration as well as the president and his family are real, even if they have not translated into much support.Eric Trump has tweeted a supportive message, and Mr. Trump has privately encouraged Dr. Jackson to run. And Dr. Jackson is benefiting, if belatedly, from Trump allies and aides who have only recently realized he needed help and have pitched in, setting him up with a real online fund-raising and phone prospecting operation, which helped to finally get him on air with a commercial -- a 30-second spot made up entirely of old clips of Mr. Trump praising his character.At the candidates forum, Dr. Jackson, 52, conceded that he had ""never really considered running for office."" But, he said, ""Trump is getting re-elected. That's a done deal at this point.""""I thought this is the unique opportunity for me to get in the game,"" he added. ""I have an opportunity to get in the fight and do something for our country.""Dr. Jackson, who served in the White House medical unit under the past three presidents, grew close to Mr. Trump after delivering the results of a presidential physical in a briefing at which he promoted Mr. Trump's ""incredible genes,"" said he did ""exceedingly well"" on a cognitive test and claimed that if he had adhered to a better diet over the past 20 years, he could have lived to be 200.His hourlong news conference transformed Dr. Jackson into an inner circle Trump favorite, and a candidate, in Mr. Trump's mind, for a cabinet post. It also changed how he was perceived outside the building.""That was the day I got the Trump stamp on me completely,"" Dr. Jackson said during an interview last week at a coffee shop in Wichita Falls. ""I was no longer viewed as a nonpartisan physician on military orders, even though I still technically was. What I didn't realize was that it made people much more aggressive toward me when the V.A. nomination came up.""At the time of the allegations against him -- which included loosely dispensing strong drugs to lawmakers and political aides -- Dr. Jackson was not allowed to respond because he was an active-duty military officer.The experience took a toll on Dr. Jackson and his family.""I tell people now that I got Kavanaugh-ed before Kavanaugh did,"" he said, referring to Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, who he believes was falsely accused of sexual assault during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings. ""I was the pregame but I didn't know it. I was the warm up.""Dr. Jackson called the allegations against him ""complete garbage"" and hinted at behind-the-scenes plotting from both parties to remove a Trump loyalist from contention.""I saw the ugly side of Washington,"" he said. He noted that despite the scandal, ""I got promoted in the White House, I maintained my clearance, I stayed in the military, I retired as a Navy admiral. Come on.""Mr. Trump mounted an aggressive defense of Dr. Jackson, even as a bipartisan group of Senators expressed concerns over his record. The president called for Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, to resign for his lead role in releasing details of the allegations against Dr. Jackson.Mr. Trump called Dr. Jackson ""one of the finest people that I have met"" while elevating him to the role of assistant to the president. And in the 13th District, those words may be more important than any accusation.""I'm leaning toward Ronny because I have to look at who's electable,"" said Danny Breegle, a business owner in Wichita Falls who attended the Thursday night forum. He said he was impressed with his résumé and ""wanted to make sure he's not of the swamp, and now I think he's independent.""But for Dr. Jackson, the question will be whether the last-ditch help from Trumpworld has come too late -- by Friday, over half of the vote will already be in because of early voting in the March 3 primary.In the interview, Dr. Jackson admitted that he had not been aggressive in calling in favors, especially from the president. ""He had so much on his plate. He was going through impeachment,"" Dr. Jackson said. ""I thought, I'm not going to put 'Ronny Jackson in the 13th Congressional District' on his plate.""If he wins the seat, Dr. Jackson will be back on a government salary. If he loses, he said, he plans to make enough money to buy his wife any house in Amarillo she wants.That is, if he doesn't go back into the Trump administration. Dr. Jackson appeared to leave himself open to the possibility, but said his wife was committed to staying in Texas.For now, Dr. Jackson said, he has put a cabinet post in his rear view mirror, calling the Veterans Affairs Department a ""massive bureaucracy"" and asserting that ""my ability to impact things will actually be better if I'm a congressman, even for the veterans.""One of his regrets was moving on from his post as White House physician before he could help institute the diet and exercise regimen he had planned for the president.During his infamous news conference, Mr. Jackson said his goal was to help Mr. Trump lose 10 to 15 pounds and that he planned to bring an exercise bike or elliptical machine into the White House residence.Mr. Jackson said those plans never came to pass. (Mr. Trump had gained four pounds by his following physical.) ""The exercise stuff never took off as much as I wanted it to,"" he said. ""But we were working on his diet. We were making the ice cream less accessible, we were putting cauliflower into the mashed potatoes.""PhotographDr. Ronny L. Jackson, the former White House physician, introduced himself to voters, top, at the Monarch Motor Speedway in Wichita Falls, Texas, last week. Dr. Jackson, who is running for Congress in one of the most conservative districts in the country, has won the support of Danny Breegle, above left, a business owner in Wichita Falls, who is shown praying before the start of a candidate forum last week.

| Jump to first hitMs. Shelton, President Trump's nominee to the central bank, has unconventional views. But a recent policy reversal is stoking the most concern.WASHINGTON -- Senators will vet Judy Shelton, a prominent Federal Reserve critic, for one of the central bank's top jobs on Thursday, a moment that many economists will be watching closely because they see her as a potential threat to the Fed's prized independence.Ms. Shelton has rhetorically questioned whether America even needs the Fed. She is a longtime fan of pegging the value of the dollar to some common anchor, like gold, a stance that the United States abandoned decades ago and one that would fundamentally change the nature of the central bank. Despite those unconventional views, she is one of President Trump's two candidates to fill the last remaining seats on the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors in Washington.It is not just her heterodox economic views that are making former central bankers and top economists wary, according to interviews. It is the possibility, based on her record, that Ms. Shelton could bend her positions to suit Mr. Trump's preferences, subordinating monetary policy to the White House's desires.The stakes are high. While individual Fed governors have just one vote out of 12 on monetary policy, she could be a natural pick to be the central bank's next chair should Mr. Trump win re-election. That would put her in a position to change the fabric of the institution. While Fed chairs must build consensus among their colleagues, they have historically been the central players in American monetary policy.""When someone is qualified, shades of gray on their politics, you just don't care -- but when it seems like they're willing to usurp all economics for political gain, that's when you've crossed a line,"" said Diane Swonk, the chief economist at the accounting firm Grant Thornton. ""It's mind-boggling. It's disturbing. It's dangerous as well, because of the potential for her to be the next Fed chair.""Ms. Shelton quietly pushed back on such criticism in prepared testimony, which was released Wednesday afternoon. She underlined her research credentials, pointing out that she has written books on economics and spent time at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. Ms. Shelton does not mention her previous role as a co-director of the Sound Money Project, which publishes essays and research on topics including the feasibility of returning to the gold standard.Her statement said that she hoped ""to contribute intellectual diversity as a governor"" and that she ""would work collegially to promote sound money and sound finances.""She would also push to ""support monetary policy that facilitates productive economic growth"" and would vote for regulation that was ""effective, efficient and appropriately tailored to financial institutions."" The Fed oversees the nation's largest banks.Those views are likely to be seen favorably at the White House.Mr. Trump has spent the past 18 months blasting his hand-chosen Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, for keeping interest rates too high. That suggests Mr. Trump, if he were to win re-election, might not reappoint Mr. Powell when his term as chair expires in early 2022.Ms. Shelton would be one potential replacement. Mr. Trump could also tap one of the other governors he has picked, including Christopher Waller, who is the research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and was nominated to the board alongside Ms. Shelton.Mr. Waller, who will also face Senate scrutiny on Thursday, was an academic before joining the Fed and has a record of research more typical of central bankers. For years, the St. Louis Fed has doubted that low unemployment would spur higher inflation, and Mr. Trump's economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, has highlighted that skepticism as a key reason the president tapped both Mr. Waller and Ms. Shelton.Given the tension between Mr. Trump and Mr. Powell, ""there's reason to think he's looking at Fed governor nominees and thinking about a future Fed chair,"" said Michael R. Strain, the director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. ""That suggests a higher level of scrutiny of these nominees is important.""Ms. Shelton's public campaigning for the Fed job, which included a series of news media interviews she arranged in the lobby of the Trump International Hotel in Washington, has helped to spur speculation that she might become a favorite to replace Mr. Powell. So have her friendship with Mr. Kudlow and her willingness to change her views.Ms. Shelton called for higher interest rates in the wake of the Great Recession and as recently as 2016. Since Mr. Trump's election, she has spoken out in favor of cuts.She initially couched her change of position as technical: Ms. Shelton said she wanted to cut rates in order to phase out the Fed's postcrisis practice of paying interest on excess money that banks deposit at the central bank. More recently, she has said lower rates would allow the economy to grow uninhibited as the administration's policies fueled higher investment and productivity. (That boom has not materialized.)""When you have an economy primed to grow because of reduced taxes, less regulation, dynamic energy and trade reforms, you want to ensure maximum access to capital,"" she told The Wall Street Journal's editorial page.She has also previously questioned the basis of the Fed's independence from the White House, even as she acknowledged that central bankers believe that distance shores up their credibility.""I don't see any reference to independence in the legislation that has defined the role of the Federal Reserve for the United States,"" she said in a question-and-answer session in Washington last year. Related legislation ""demands that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve work hand in hand with Congress and the president to meet certain strategic economic goals for the United States.""Ms. Shelton did nod at the Fed's independence several times in her written testimony.""Along with the political independence and operational autonomy granted to the Federal Reserve comes an obligation to be wholly accountable both to Congress and to the public,"" the testimony said.She would hardly be the first appointment to the seven-member Fed Board with a heavy partisan lean. President Ronald Reagan, who was not a fan of Fed independence, stacked the Fed with enough supporters to challenge the chair at the time, Paul A. Volcker.But current Fed officials robustly defend the central bank's independence from politics, and Mr. Powell often says interest rates are set with an eye toward the economy alone because the Fed avoids ""mistakes of character."" History suggests, and some research shows, that politically tied central bankers can favor policy that hurts the economy in the longer run.Ms. Shelton is expected to face pointed questioning at her confirmation hearing on Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee and must ultimately win confirmation from the full Senate.Bankers are skeptical of Ms. Shelton's nomination. One senior financial services executive said her questioning of the Fed's independence, her skepticism of the need for deposit insurance and her track record of advocating an anchored currency are areas that would draw lawmaker questions.When Mr. Powell testifies on Capitol Hill, as he did this week, he is assured that the Fed's independence is valued, and senators have previously shot down possible Trump administration appointments to the Fed's board that were viewed as problematic. The conservative commentator Stephen Moore and the former pizza executive Herman Cain were talked about for the job but were never formally nominated. But it was not monetary policy or partisanship that did them in: Their chances folded after lawmakers expressed concern about their past statements and actions toward women.Lawmakers have approached Ms. Shelton's nomination more cautiously.Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, who had cooled on Mr. Cain, has called Mr. Waller and Ms. Shelton ""well qualified."" Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota, made a case for diverse views at the Fed while questioning Mr. Powell at a Banking Committee hearing on Wednesday.Past Fed nominees have scuppered their chances during their Senate testimonies. But Ms. Shelton has already passed Senate confirmation once, when Mr. Trump nominated her as the American envoy to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. She is a practiced public speaker.If Ms. Shelton is confirmed for the Fed but never elevated as the chair, she will have more limited room to shake things up since individual governors hold just one vote on monetary policy, alongside their six fellow board members and five regional Fed presidents.Governors have historically used public remarks to shape broader policy discussions. Such activism can help to rein in groupthink -- or it can be used to serve a political agenda.""If Dr. Shelton comes onto the Board of Governors and just represents a different point of view, there is no harm to it and possibly some good,"" said Adam S. Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""If, however, this is an attempt to politicize the board's discussion and possibly undermine the chair,"" then ""that would be a loss for the whole country.""PhotographJudy Shelton, nominated by President Trump to the Fed's Board of Governors, will face questions at her Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday.

| Jump to first hit1. When does primary season begin? How long is it?Voting begins Feb. 3 with the Iowa caucuses. The last states vote in early June.So, four months. Like a college semester, except in the end all but one person will flunk out.2. Who will I be voting for in the primaries?The main event: candidates for the Democratic and Republican 2020 presidential nominations.But voters will find all manner of down-ballot elections to consider on primary day, including House and Senate races and seats on the state legislature. You might be voting for the presidents of tomorrow in those contests.3. What's the difference between primaries and caucuses?Primaries are reasonably straightforward: Voters vote, and their votes go to candidates who hope to receive more votes than the other candidates.Caucuses are like this in spirit, but with a dash of municipal sausage-making and D.M.V.-style chaos.Generally, supporters for various candidates sit or stand together in groups. A head count is conducted. And if a candidate doesn't reach a certain threshold of support -- say, 15 percent of attendees at a caucus site -- the group is deemed ""nonviable,"" and its members realign with other clusters before a final count is made.Democracy!4. So when do I vote?Three possibilities:Early voting. Enjoy responsibly! And check out the rules and dates for your state.Election Day voting. The classic! Also varies by state, of course.Your primary was canceled. Better luck next time!5. Can states actually cancel their primaries?They can, and they did!While President Trump would be an overwhelming favorite to win a Republican primary in any state, some of them have decided to scrap the exercise altogether. Trump critics called the moves antidemocratic, but there is bipartisan precedent for such cancellations when a party's incumbent is seeking re-election.6. Is there a Republican presidential primary, officially?Yes, in most states.Mr. Trump's opponents include Joe Walsh, a former Illinois congressman, and William F. Weld, a former governor of Massachusetts. At present, they are approximately as likely to win as any person reading this sentence. #SentenceReaders20207. Can I vote in both the Democratic primary and the Republican primary?One vote per person, folks.And in some states with so-called closed primaries, you'll need to be registered with a given party to participate.8. Will impeachment affect the campaign?As a practical matter, the impeachment trial in the Senate will keep several Democratic candidates in Washington during crucial would-be campaign days.As an issue for voters, impeachment is not necessarily front of mind. The top Democrats tend to agree that Mr. Trump should be removed from office -- and they also expect the Republican-led Senate to clear him.In recent weeks, voters have pressed candidates much more often on issues like health care and climate than on any allegations of executive high crimes and misdemeanors.9. Could Trump get elected president again, even after being impeached by the House?That's his plan.Mr. Trump is the first impeached president ever to seek re-election. He would like to be the first impeached president to win again.10. I keep hearing this is the largest Democratic field. How big is it, actually?At present, it's 12 deep -- enough to fill a baseball lineup and accommodate a few benchwarmers, too.At its peak, the field swelled well into the 20s, exceeding even the unwieldy 2016 Republican roster and requiring two nights of 10-person debates that nonetheless barred a handful of candidates from the stage.11. Who's likely to win the Democratic nomination?Where's the suspense in telling you now?Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has often led in national polls, but the state-level surveys are more of a muddle. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has raised the most money and retains a loyal core of support from his 2016 run.Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend., Ind., have shown strength in Iowa at various points. Betting markets appraise Mr. Biden as the likeliest nominee. They also liked Jeb Bush's chances in 2016.12. Which Democrat has the best chance of beating Trump?For months, Democratic voters have talked constantly about electability.They have had a harder time agreeing on what it means -- or at least, who best embodies it.Biden supporters say the party needs someone who can appeal to white working-class voters who gravitated to Mr. Trump.Some Warren supporters consider this to be a sexist euphemism for an older male nominee, arguing that Ms. Warren's raft of liberal plans can better inspire the masses.Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have suggested that a Midwestern sensibility is best.And Mr. Sanders, whose admirers insist he would have defeated Mr. Trump in 2016 if given the chance, has been perhaps the least subtle at times. A campaign swing planned last year was billed as the ""Bernie Beats Trump"" tour.13. Why do I keep hearing that Iowa is so important?Because Iowa goes first and has since the 1970s.Why? There's no great reason (though the tumultuous 1968 Democratic convention set the stage to an extent), and inertia is a powerful thing. It's sort of like a teacher giving extra credit to the student who comes first alphabetically, except instead of extra credit, it's kind words from national politicians about the good people of Sioux City.Strictly speaking, Iowa awards a relatively small share of delegates (more on that shortly). But winning the state, or even exceeding expectations as a non-winner, can propel a campaign through the rest of the early calendar.14. What's Super Tuesday?Super Tuesday, March 3, is perhaps the most important single date on the primary calendar because of how many major states will be holding their elections, including California and Texas.About 40 percent of all pledged Democratic delegates will be awarded in these states.15. How does someone win the Democratic nomination?A candidate hoping to win on the first ballot at the convention must secure a majority of pledged delegates, as dictated by the outcomes in state primaries and caucuses.In total, there are just under 4,000 pledged delegates up for grabs (as well as hundreds of superdelegates, though the party prefers to call them automatic delegates). The official nomination will take place at the party's convention in Milwaukee this summer.16. What are delegates?Delegates (the people) are political figures like activists and local leaders chosen to represent their states at the party convention.Delegates (the numbers) are the all-purpose metric of primary success, allocated proportionally according to state voting results.Generally, a candidate must exceed 15 percent of the vote in a congressional district or statewide to win delegates.17. What are superdelegates? Didn't they get rid of those?Democratic superdelegates are the political insiders, from sitting lawmakers to former senior party officials, whose primary choices can be divorced entirely from the preferences of workaday voters.Superdelegates can vote as they choose, and their very existence in 2016 became a source of major tension in the race between Hillary Clinton and Mr. Sanders. While Mrs. Clinton bested Mr. Sanders among pledged delegates in 2016, Mr. Sanders and his supporters saw the superdelegate system as an affront to the democratic process.In response, the Democratic National Committee has sharply reduced the influence of superdelegates, effectively preventing them from participating substantively in the first ballot of the presidential nominating process. But in the event of a deadlock at the convention, superdelegates could come into play.18. Are there any history makers in the presidential election?Ms. Warren or Ms. Klobuchar (or Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii) would be the first woman elected president. Mr. Buttigieg would be the first openly gay person to hold the office.But for all the initial excitement within the party about a deep bench of candidates of color, several -- including Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey and Julián Castro, the former federal housing secretary -- have dropped out. The remaining low-polling nonwhite candidates include Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Andrew Yang, a former technology executive.Then there is this bit of potential history: Mr. Sanders (78), Mr. Biden (77), Michael R. Bloomberg (77) and Ms. Warren (70) and would each be the oldest president ever inaugurated for a first term.19. Is there still a chance that a new longshot will emerge?Sure. Just not a great one.There's a cliché in politics: ""The only poll that matters is on Election Day."" But some other things that matter -- staffing, fund-raising, a workable delegate strategy -- are built well in advance.And many of the lower-tier candidates have been running for many, many months without catching on.A former Maryland congressman named John Delaney has been campaigning for president since the middle of 2017. He has not measurably improved his standing. But perhaps the final weeks will uncover a surge of Delan-iacs who had been keeping their feelings to themselves.20. What's Michael Bloomberg up to?Spending a nine-figure fortune on a possibly quixotic candidacy.But he does have a plan, albeit an unusual one. Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, is effectively skipping the early nominating contests to focus on delegate-rich states that vote in March and beyond. He is already ubiquitous in television ads and has amassed a small army of staff members to sustain his bid for as long as he chooses.Yet he is lagging much of the field in the often-relevant category of ""interactions with actual primary voters."" And if any candidate emerges from the February states as a clear front-runner, Mr. Bloomberg's time-biding approach could backfire.21. Which party has done better in fund-raising so far?Mr. Trump entered 2020 with more than $100 million in cash on hand and outpaced every Democrat with $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.But contenders for the Democratic nomination have cumulatively surpassed Mr. Trump's total, suggesting intense enthusiasm. Safe to say that neither party's nominee will go hungry this fall.22. Which voters are Democrats targeting?Mr. Biden generally does best with older voters and African-Americans. Ms. Warren is most popular with highly educated Democrats. Mr. Sanders, despite his age, rules the young. And Mr. Buttigieg, 38, despite his age, draws much of his support from a very different demographic.Particularly after Iowa and New Hampshire, which are overwhelmingly white, candidates will be pitching themselves to a much more diverse party electorate. Several candidates, particularly Mr. Buttigieg, have struggled in polls of voters of color. But many campaigns are hopeful that strong showings in the early states will earn them a longer look.23. What issues have dominated the race this year?Health care policy has probably been the most conspicuous, with divisions over the relative virtues of ""Medicare For all"" (one of Mr. Sanders's signature issues) or a more incremental approach.Gun control has come up some, especially after the El Paso massacre last summer.Ms. Warren was often the pacesetter in attention-grabbing proposals, like her bid to break up tech giants such as Amazon and Facebook.Some candidates, like Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg, have turned their attention to the more amorphous issue of national unity: They frame the election as a moment for healing, though no Democrat has identified as anti-healing, exactly.24. Does my vote in the primaries matter?Sure, why not? Nihilism is for Nietzscheans and Knicks fans.And while the piecemeal nature of the state-by-state calendar might make the process seem less exciting than the all-in-one-day general election, the primaries do resolve the nontrivial matter of choosing major party nominees.25. Is it O.K. for me to skip voting in the primaries and just vote in the general election?It's allowed.Of course, candidates tend to call every election ""the most important of our lifetime."" By definition, that can't always be true. But don't forget the down-ballot primaries, which will be of significant consequence locally in many states.26. Can I vote in the primaries in one state and then the general election in another state?Potentially, if you time it right and change your registration by the fall.And if you happen to be that rare voter moving from an early-voting primary state like New Hampshire to a November swing state like Pennsylvania, well, enjoy the attention.27. Do I need to be registered to vote in the primaries?Forty-nine states require voter registration. (North Dakota, you incorrigible contrarians.)Deadlines can be found here.28. Do I need a government-issued ID?Requirements vary by state. Here's a detailed rundown.29. What if I was removed in a voter purge?Those worried about their status can check here.30. Can I vote over the Internet?Generally, no.Some states allow it in certain (often narrowly defined) circumstances.31. Are Russians going to interfere again?The intelligence community is certainly bracing for it.Despite the president's longstanding doubts about the intelligence consensus on Russian interference in 2016, officials have warned that a sequel of sorts is in the works. After detecting evidence of Russian influence efforts in 2018, Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, said last year that he viewed the attempts as ""kind of a dress rehearsal for the big show in 2020.""32. How can I tell this year if Trump's chances of winning re-election are increasing?Historically, the health of the economy is a useful indicator. So are approval ratings.But consulting precedent can be complicated where Mr. Trump is concerned.On the one hand, his party suffered steep midterm losses in 2018 despite low unemployment and many positive economic trends. On the other, Mr. Trump won in 2016 despite often dismal favorability scores.Whether he can repeat the feat might come down to this: Was Mrs. Clinton a uniquely unpopular nominee? Or will any Democrat eventually look beatable once the president and his allies have a single opponent to attack every day?33. Should I trust the polls after 2016?Yes and no.Imperfect polls (which is to say, all of them) are still far more instructive than none at all, if contextualized with care. And while Mr. Trump's 2016 success in states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan was a surprise, the popular vote margin -- Mrs. Clinton by a couple of points -- was consistent with much of the late-stage national polling.But of course, the only bulletproof prediction through political history is that people who make political predictions will keep getting things wrong sometimes.34. Are we going to be O.K.?Were we ever, really?35. When is this all over?It's probably best not to think about that. More than 280 days left until general election.Sources: The campaigns (campaign finance); The Green Papers (election calendar and delegate numbers); Ballotpedia (canceled primaries).

| Jump to first hitIn tweets and an interview with Sean Hannity, the president mocked the former New York mayor who seems to be on his mind.WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- On many levels, President Trump's weekend -- full of golf, catered salmon and plenty of patriotic-themed evening wear -- could have been devised to offer relief and a sense of triumph to a president who spent the first month of an election year watching from the sidelines as the Senate debated his future.With his acquittal all but final, the president passed from table to table in the dining room of his golf club on Saturday quizzing his buddies on the 2020 election, at times lingering long enough to complain about his impeachment ordeal.""What a waste,"" the president told a group of supporters, according to one guest who had such an exchange with him. ""What a waste of time.""By Saturday night, the president was in a more celebratory mood when he greeted the band of supporters gathered at Mar-a-Lago, his private club.Under a large illustration that depicted him dressed as a football player, Mr. Trump regaled them with his latest approval ratings -- ""We just had our best poll numbers that we've ever had,"" he said to the group -- and walked into the dining room to Lee Greenwood's ""God Bless the U.S.A."" The song is played every time Mr. Trump takes the stage at one of his rallies, and Mr. Greenwood was performing it live for the special occasion.""As usual, our president scored another victory,"" Toni Kramer, the supporter who organized the party for him, said in an interview. ""He won the Super Bowl of Washington.""But that sense of celebration appeared to be fleeting as the evening went on and Mr. Trump's anger over impeachment, and his antipathy toward his possible 2020 election opponents -- in particular, Michael R. Bloomberg -- spilled into public view. There were more pressing matters at hand, including the global spread of the coronavirus and his State of the Union address on Tuesday, but he made little mention of them.Sunday night the president and Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and a latecomer to the Democratic race who is not on the ballot in the Iowa caucuses on Monday, would face off in costly Super Bowl ads. But Mr. Trump, who seems to be increasingly fixated on Mr. Bloomberg and the fortune he is vowing to spend on the election, apparently could not wait.In a tweet sent just after midnight, Mr. Trump tried to implicate Mr. Bloomberg in a conspiracy theory he has used in an apparent attempt to sow divisions in the Democratic presidential field.""Many of the ads you are watching were paid for by Mini Mike Bloomberg,"" Mr. Trump said. ""He is going nowhere, just wasting his money, but he is getting the DNC to rig the election against Crazy Bernie, something they wouldn't do for @CoryBooker and others. They are doing it to Bernie again, 2016.""More tweets about Mr. Bloomberg followed, culminating in an interview with Sean Hannity, the Fox News personality and presidential confidant, that was taped on Saturday but aired three hours before the game.In the interview, the president reiterated a false claim he had sent in a late-night tweet: that Mr. Bloomberg had demanded a box to stand on should he participate in a Democratic candidates' debate.""You know, now he wants a box for the debates to stand on. O.K., it's O.K., there's nothing wrong,"" Mr. Trump said. ""You can be short. Why should he get a box to stand on, O.K.? He wants a box for the debates. Why should he be entitled to that? Really. Does that mean everyone else gets a box?""Mr. Bloomberg's campaign spokeswoman, Julie Wood, did not hold anything back in her response. ""The president is lying,"" she said. ""He is a pathological liar who lies about everything: his fake hair, his obesity and his spray-on tan.""While he focused on Mr. Bloomberg, the president did not spare any of his Democratic rivals. He and Mr. Hannity played a lightning round where Mr. Hannity invited the president to say whatever came to mind about Democratic presidential candidates, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Mr. Trump falsely called Mr. Sanders a ""communist"" and claimed that he had been married in Russia.""I think of communism when I think of Bernie,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Didn't he get married in Moscow?""Mr. Sanders was married in Burlington, Vt., before traveling to the Soviet Union soon after, and the trip has been used as fodder by his critics as evidence that he has communist leanings.During his Fox sit-down, both Mr. Trump and his interviewer seemed more interested in allowing the president to focus on his grievances over impeachment and his re-election effort rather than elaborate on a global public health crisis.""It's been very unfair from the day I won,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Mostly it was unfair to my family.""He gave a comparatively cursory amount of attention to the spread of the coronavirus, which caused his administration to bar foreign nationals and Americans who had traveled to China recently from entering the United States.""We pretty much shut it down coming in from China,"" Mr. Trump said of the coronavirus. ""But we can't have thousands of people coming in who may have this problem, the coronavirus.""Mr. Trump summed it up this way: ""So we're going to see what happens. But we did shut it down, yes.""Mr. Trump was even less expansive when Mr. Hannity asked whether he had considered moving his State of the Union address, which is scheduled to take place before the Senate impeachment trial officially concludes on Wednesday. The president replied: ""No, I'm going to have it. It's going to be done. We're going to talk about the achievements that we've made.""""Nobody has made achievements like we've made,"" Mr. Trump said of his speech, ""so many different things.""As the game drew closer, the president appeared to once again redirect his focus -- this time to attend the annual Super Bowl watch party he holds at his West Palm Beach golf club. Mr. Trump watched a marching band play ""Born to Be Wild"" on the club's lawn, then went inside to watch the night's competitors -- and perhaps some football -- before departing to Washington.PhotographThe president boarding Air Force One to fly to Florida on Friday. In an interview on Sunday, he voiced his anger over impeachment.

| Jump to first hitFirst Iowa, then New Hampshire. Now the president is on a Western trip, and basing it in Las Vegas, days before the Nevada caucuses.LAS VEGAS -- President Trump is not exactly a fan of life on the road.He agreed to a four-day Western trip this week on the condition that he spend every night at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. And that location had another attraction: It placed him at the current center of the 2020 presidential race -- Nevada, where Democrats will vote Saturday in caucuses that could reshape the campaign.The trip was meant to showcase the president's aggressive re-election push to drum up funds from high-dollar donors in California, a Democratic state where Mr. Trump is widely unpopular but enjoys some concentrated pockets of support. But the president believes that wherever he goes, he can force the news cycles -- and political fortunes -- to turn in his favor.And the first opportunity to do that was Wednesday night, at the same time the Democrats debated in Las Vegas.""Should I go to that debate?"" Mr. Trump asked a group of volunteers gathered at his hotel before he left for a high-dollar fund-raiser in Palm Springs, Calif.The president then set off on a hectic schedule that had him hopscotching around California and touching down in Phoenix for a ""Keep America Great"" rally before returning to Las Vegas for the night. And he will hold two other rallies before returning to Washington -- on Thursday in Colorado Springs and on Friday in Las Vegas.Both in private and in public, it was clear that Mr. Trump did not want to cede any political spotlight to Democrats on the debate stage.""We've seen the polls except some of the fake ones,"" Mr. Trump said in Phoenix. ""If I was treated fairly, we'd be up 20 points higher in the polls. There wouldn't even be a competitive election. Unfortunately, I think it's probably going to be competitive.""Journalists were not invited to the president's campaign breakfast at his hotel, but a New York Times reporter was dining in the restaurant as a guest. There, Mr. Trump took aim at CNN and MSNBC for reporting on the polls, but saved his special contempt for Comcast, which owns NBC Universal. He called the media conglomerate ""corrupt"" and a ""disgrace to this country.""Mr. Trump was reacting to several recently released polls, including one by NBC and The Wall Street Journal, that show him trailing several possible Democratic opponents, including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.""Internal REAL polls show I am beating all of the Dem candidates,"" Mr. Trump tweeted shortly before leaving for Rancho Mirage, Calif., near Palm Springs, for a private fund-raiser. ""The Fake News Polls (here we go again, just like 2016) show losing or tied.""One Democrat in particular has held the president's attention: Michael R. Bloomberg. For weeks, Mr. Trump has been preoccupied with Mr. Bloomberg, a former New York City mayor and late entry to the Democratic presidential race.""Is corrupt Bloomberg News going to say what a pathetic debater Mini Mike is,"" Mr. Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning, using a nickname to insult Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire who has recently enjoyed a surge of popularity but who was untested on the debate stage.At his rally, the president again assailed polling in the news media and expressed criticism that Mr. Bloomberg had bought his way into the Democratic race, appearing to fixate on the amount of money the former mayor had spent on his campaign.""My father would teach me: If you could spend less and win, that's better than spending a lot and winning,"" he told the crowd.Mr. Trump's setting up base in Nevada this week was not the first time he suddenly appeared in the middle of the Democratic Party's nominating process. Last month, he held a rally in Des Moines, four days before the Iowa caucuses.Eleven days later, the president traveled to Manchester, N.H., the evening before the state held its primary election on Feb. 11, though in that case he was on the Republican ballot.""If you want clear proof of how terrified Donald Trump is, just look at his travel schedule,"" Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said on Wednesday. ""He keeps following Democrats from state to state because he knows our message is resonating. Nevada is no exception. Nevadans have rejected this president and his policies, and they're ready to elect a Democrat to the White House.""In Nevada, it seemed that voters were attuned to Mr. Trump's attempts to wrest attention back to his own campaign.""It's really disruptive, and in a way it goes hand in hand with his presidency,"" Hillary Steinberg, 56, said at a restaurant in the Las Vegas Arts District. ""His entire presidency has been a disruption, so it makes sense that he would do a rally so close to the primary.""Rick Van Diepen, an owner of a sustainable architecture consultancy in Las Vegas, said that it was a ""pretty typical distraction,"" but an effective one.""It's a good tactic to keep his base energized, especially in a state that doesn't have a Republican primary,"" said Mr. Van Diepen, 49. ""It's reminding them that he's here, too.""But at his rally, Mr. Trump tried to pre-emptively cast doubt on the Nevada electoral process, using the caucus chaos in Iowa as an example. (Technical glitches, among other problems, caused a major delay in reporting the results from the state's first-in-the-national presidential contest.)""In Nevada I'm hearing bad things about the vote count -- they don't know what the hell they're doing,"" the president said before quickly adding he hoped that was not the case.Aside from the attention-grabbing spectacle of long lines, ample media coverage and cars festooned with Trump-Pence signs driving by candidates' events, Mr. Trump's travels through four states on his Western swing have created a logistical nightmare for some Democratic candidates.At least one campaign complained that Mr. Trump's trip to Las Vegas hampered its Thursday plans, with the flight restrictions that accompany an Air Force One arrival and departure complicating its attempts for travel to more than one other state from now until Saturday.But Justin Buoen, Senator Amy Klobuchar's campaign manager, saw only an upside to the president's presence.""I haven't gotten any sense that people care about him being here except for that it fires our base up,"" he said. ""I don't think it's hurt coverage of the candidates on cable news networks or even local TV. It hasn't been any kind of distraction.""Though she rarely even makes mention of the president's current travels, Ms. Klobuchar, of Minnesota, does have a favorite laugh line in her stump speech regarding Mr. Trump's last-minute rallies before the Louisiana and Kentucky governors' elections last year.""The night before the election in both those states, who went down there to campaign for those Democratic governors as opponents? Donald Trump,"" Ms. Klobuchar has said. ""So my first question is, where can we send him next? Because that went pretty well.""The Democratic candidates won in both cases.Reporting was contributed by Jim Rutenberg, Reid J. Epstein, Maggie Haberman, Nick Corasaniti and Isabella Grullón Paz.PhotographPresident Trump on Wednesday in Palm Springs, Calif.

| Jump to first hitThe president asked his national security adviser last spring in front of other senior advisers to pave the way for a meeting between Rudolph Giuliani and Ukraine's new leader.WASHINGTON -- More than two months before he asked Ukraine's president to investigate his political opponents, President Trump directed John R. Bolton, then his national security adviser, to help with his pressure campaign to extract damaging information on Democrats from Ukrainian officials, according to an unpublished manuscript by Mr. Bolton.Mr. Trump gave the instruction, Mr. Bolton wrote, during an Oval Office conversation in early May that included the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, the president's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and the White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, who is now leading the president's impeachment defense.Mr. Trump told Mr. Bolton to call Volodymyr Zelensky, who had recently won election as president of Ukraine, to ensure Mr. Zelensky would meet with Mr. Giuliani, who was planning a trip to Ukraine to discuss the investigations that the president sought, in Mr. Bolton's account. Mr. Bolton never made the call, he wrote.The previously undisclosed directive that Mr. Bolton describes would be the earliest known instance of Mr. Trump seeking to harness the power of the United States government to advance his pressure campaign against Ukraine, as he later did on the July call with Mr. Zelensky that triggered a whistle-blower complaint and impeachment proceedings. House Democrats have accused him of abusing his authority and are arguing their case before senators in the impeachment trial of Mr. Trump, whose lawyers have said he did nothing wrong.The account in Mr. Bolton's manuscript portrays the most senior White House advisers as early witnesses in the effort that they have sought to distance the president from. And disclosure of the meeting underscores the kind of information Democrats were looking for in seeking testimony from his top advisers in their impeachment investigation, including Mr. Bolton and Mr. Mulvaney, only to be blocked by the White House.In a statement after this article was published, Mr. Trump denied the discussion that Mr. Bolton described.""I never instructed John Bolton to set up a meeting for Rudy Giuliani, one of the greatest corruption fighters in America and by far the greatest mayor in the history of N.Y.C., to meet with President Zelensky,"" Mr. Trump said. ""That meeting never happened.""In a brief interview, Mr. Giuliani denied that the conversation took place and said those discussions with the president were always kept separate. He was adamant that Mr. Cipollone and Mr. Mulvaney were never involved in meetings related to Ukraine.""It is absolutely, categorically untrue,"" he said.Neither Mr. Bolton nor a representative for Mr. Mulvaney responded to requests for comment.Mr. Bolton described the roughly 10-minute conversation in drafts of his book, a memoir of his time as national security adviser that is to go on sale in March. Over several pages, Mr. Bolton laid out Mr. Trump's fixation on Ukraine and the president's belief, based on a mix of scattershot events, assertions and outright conspiracy theories, that Ukraine tried to undermine his chances of winning the presidency in 2016.As he began to realize the extent and aims of the pressure campaign, Mr. Bolton began to object, he wrote in the book, affirming the testimony of a former National Security Council aide, Fiona Hill, who had said that Mr. Bolton warned that Mr. Giuliani was ""a hand grenade who's going to blow everybody up.""Mr. Bolton's account matches up with a timeline of other developments in the Ukraine affair. On May 9, The New York Times disclosed that Mr. Giuliani was planning to travel to Ukraine to press for the investigations sought by Mr. Trump, saying, ""We're not meddling in an election, we're meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do."" The following day, Mr. Giuliani sent a letter to Mr. Zelensky seeking a meeting later in May ""with the knowledge and consent"" of Mr. Trump.Within weeks, with Mr. Giuliani's request to meet with Mr. Zelensky proving unsuccessful, Mr. Trump would empower a group of American diplomats to work with Mr. Giuliani to continue pressing Ukraine to agree to his desire for the investigations, according to testimony in the House impeachment inquiry.Mr. Trump also repeatedly made national security decisions contrary to American interests, Mr. Bolton wrote, describing a pervasive sense of alarm among top advisers about the president's choices. Mr. Bolton expressed concern to others in the administration that the president was effectively granting favors to autocratic leaders like Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Xi Jinping of China.The Times reported this week on another revelation from Mr. Bolton's book draft: that Mr. Trump told him in August that he wanted to continue freezing $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations into Democrats including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter. That account undercuts a key element of the White House impeachment defense -- that the aid holdup was separate from his requests for inquiries. Mr. Trump has denied the conversation took place.Since that Times article, people who have reviewed the draft have further described its contents, including details of the May meeting. Mr. Bolton's manuscript was sent to the White House for a standard review process in late December.Its revelations galvanized the debate over whether to call witnesses in the impeachment trial, but late on Thursday, Republicans appeared to have secured enough votes to keep any new testimony out of Mr. Trump's trial and to move toward a quick acquittal in the third presidential impeachment trial in American history.The White House has sought to block the release of the book, contending that it contains classified information. The government reviews books by former officials who had access to secrets so they can excise the manuscripts of any classified information. Officials including Mr. Trump have described Mr. Bolton, who was often at odds with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Mr. Mulvaney, as a disgruntled former official with an ax to grind.Mr. Bolton has angered Democrats -- and some Republicans -- for remaining quiet during the House investigation, then announcing that he would comply with any subpoena to testify in the Senate and signaling that he is eager to share his story. Administration officials should ""feel they're able to speak their minds without retribution,"" he said at a closed-door lunch in Austin, Texas, on Thursday, the NBC affiliate KXAN reported, citing unnamed sources.""The idea that somehow testifying to what you think is true is destructive to the system of government we have -- I think, is very nearly the reverse, the exact reverse of the truth,"" Mr. Bolton added.The Oval Office conversation that Mr. Bolton described came as the president and Mr. Giuliani were increasingly focusing on pushing the Ukrainian government to commit to investigations that could help Mr. Trump politically. At various points, Mr. Trump, Mr. Giuliani and their associates pressed Ukrainian officials under Mr. Zelensky and his predecessor to provide potentially damaging information on the president's rivals, including Mr. Biden and Ukrainians who Mr. Trump's allies believed tried to help Hillary Clinton in 2016.Mr. Giuliani had just successfully campaigned to have the American ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, recalled, convinced that she was part of an effort to protect Mr. Trump's political rivals from scrutiny. Mr. Giuliani had argued she was impeding the investigations.At the time of the Oval Office conversation Mr. Bolton wrote about, Mr. Giuliani was planning a trip to Kyiv to push the incoming government to commit to the investigations. Mr. Giuliani asserted that the president had been wronged by the Justice Department's Russia investigation and told associates that the inquiry could be partly discredited by proving that parts of it originated with suspect documents produced and disseminated in Ukraine to undermine his onetime campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, whose work in Ukraine became a central focus of the Russia inquiry.Mr. Giuliani, a private consultant with a range of international clients, had said none were involved in the Ukraine effort, Mr. Bolton wrote, adding that he was skeptical and wanted to avoid involvement. At the time, Mr. Giuliani was working closely with two Soviet-born businessmen from Florida, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, to carry out the shadow Ukraine effort.After pushing out Ms. Yovanovitch, Mr. Giuliani turned his attention to other American diplomats responsible for Ukraine policy. During the Oval Office conversation, he also mentioned a State Department official with the last name of Kent, whom Mr. Bolton wrote he did not know. Mr. Giuliani said he was hostile to Mr. Trump and sympathetic to George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist who has long been a target of the far right.George P. Kent, a top State Department official who oversees Ukraine policy, went on to be a key witness in House Democrats' impeachment investigation, testifying that claims by Mr. Giuliani's allies of Mr. Soros' wide influence in Ukraine were used to smear Ms. Yovanovitch.Mr. Bolton left the Oval Office after 10 minutes and returned to his office, he wrote. Shortly after, two aides came into his office, saying Mr. Trump had sent them out of a separate meeting on trade to ask about Mr. Kent, Mr. Bolton wrote.Asked about Mr. Bolton's account, Mr. Giuliani said, ""I think he's making some of it up. He's sure making up -- I wouldn't call it making it up, but he's acting like a real scumbag by never telling me that he objected once, and then saying I was a time bomb, or a firecracker or something.""The conversation that Mr. Bolton describes was separate from another one that Mr. Bolton wrote about, where he observed Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Trump talking on the phone with Mr. Giuliani about Ukraine matters. Mr. Mulvaney has told associates he would leave the room when Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani were talking to preserve their attorney-client privilege, and his lawyer said earlier this week that Mr. Mulvaney was never in meetings with Mr. Giuliani and has ""no recollection"" of the first discussion.Peter Baker and Kenneth P. Vogel contributed reporting.PhotographJohn Bolton, the former national security adviser, in July. His memoir is set to go on sale in March.

| Jump to first hitMr. Jones, the lone Democratic senator from the Deep South, is in a precarious political position as he cautiously approaches impeachment in a state where President Trump is immensely popular.MOBILE, Ala. -- Senator Doug Jones of Alabama waved a stack of legal pads in the air -- all of them filled with his notes from the opening days of President Trump's impeachment trial -- and insisted he needed to hear more facts. ""Yesterday's evidence was pretty compelling,"" he said in a video posted to his Twitter feed last week. ""So I'm anxious to see what the president will say and do.""Mr. Jones has recorded five-minute segments like these every morning since the trial began to try to answer why he is still undecided on a question that most Americans resolved long ago. ""I caution everyone that we're still in the early stages,"" Mr. Jones, a former trial lawyer, said in another video. ""We've got to hear the other side of the story.""As the lone Democrat in the Senate representing the Deep South, a region that is solidly pro-Trump, Mr. Jones is in a precarious position. Political prudence demands that he take an exceedingly measured approach to his vote on whether to remove Mr. Trump from office. The senator has spent weeks pleading for open-mindedness, even going so far as to raise doubts about the Democrats' case against the president, saying last month that ""there are gaps.""The challenge for Mr. Jones is whether voters see him as reasonable and unbiased, as he hopes, or as an appeaser of the other side. His appeals risk alienating not only the Trump-supporting Alabamians he has to answer to when he faces re-election in November, but also liberal Democrats -- his base -- some of whom he says have wanted to remove the president since ""the minute he took his hand off the Bible when he was sworn in.""In interviews with 20 Alabama voters over the past week, the senator's contemplative approach seems to have persuaded very few. Approve or disapprove of Mr. Trump, they expressed the kind of certainty about impeachment that Mr. Jones will not give them.Impeachment, Skeeter Diehl of Mobile said, ""is a bunch of bull, the whole thing -- just a bunch of noise."" As Ms. Diehl sat with friends for lunch at Noble South, a bistro downtown, she said Mr. Jones would be smart not to get crosswise with the president and his voters. And she predicted that if he wanted to save his seat, ""he's not going to step out there"" and vote to remove Mr. Trump.But Janelle Finley, a 32-year-old from Mobile who votes Democratic most of the time, was just as resolute in her support for impeachment. She said what mattered most to her when casting a vote was finding a politician whose ""morals match mine,"" and Mr. Trump's decidedly did not. When she considered the case against the president, she saw something larger at risk than the possible loss a Democratic seat in the Senate.""If Doug Jones goes one way because he thinks it will hurt him in November ..."" Ms. Finley added, pausing to consider the possibility that he might vote not to convict because it could cost him the election. Then she shook her head incredulously. ""After all this evidence?""""This is an issue for all of us,"" she continued. ""And right now the world is watching and seeing how divided and broken we are.""Mr. Jones's predicament represents the flip side of the one facing vulnerable Republican senators in states with less political homogeneity, like Susan Collins of Maine and Cory Gardner of Colorado, where moderate voters might exact retribution for what they view as letting Mr. Trump off the hook.In a brief interview last week, Mr. Jones said he felt the pressure of the impeachment trial every day. ""I mean, this is not something that I bargained for when I ran for this office,"" he said, adding that he could ""really feel the weight of the oath of office and the Constitution on my shoulders.""He has also called for hearing testimony from John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, after the revelation that a draft of Mr. Bolton's forthcoming book claims that the president wanted to keep aid to Ukraine frozen until officials there helped him with investigations into Democratic rivals.Alabama briefly broke a long cycle of Republican dominance in December 2017 when it elected Mr. Jones, the first time in 25 years that the state sent a Democrat to the United States Senate. At the time, many Democrats and progressive activists held up Mr. Jones's victory as a template for how to be competitive in deeply conservative states.But Mr. Jones capitalized on a unique set of circumstances: the outrage surrounding his opponent, Roy S. Moore, a Trump-endorsed former state judge who had been accused of forcing himself on teenage girls. Mr. Jones, a former United States attorney who prosecuted one of the most notorious crimes of the civil rights era, the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, turned out large numbers of black voters. And he benefited from the support of a smaller number of suburban white voters who were usually reliable Republicans.He won the race by less than 21,000 votes, or 1.5 percentage points, with a boost from traditionally Republican areas like Mobile County, which he carried by 14 points. (In 2016, Mr. Trump won the county by 13 points.)But an unusually high number of votes cast in the race were write-ins for candidates not on the ballot at all -- nearly 23,000 -- suggesting that while many Republicans had turned their backs on Mr. Moore, they could not bring themselves to vote for a Democrat.""When you have Roy Moore and Doug Jones, for a lot of people it's not 'How do I vote?' It's 'Do I even vote?""' said Josh Woods, 32, from Mobile.Mr. Woods said he had written in the name of someone else instead of voting for either candidate. As for how he thought Mr. Jones would handle his vote on Mr. Trump's impeachment trial, Mr. Woods said, ""He's well aware of his surroundings.""Mr. Woods said he did not see himself voting for Mr. Jones in November, given that Republicans were likely to nominate someone more mainstream than Mr. Moore.Without disaffected Republicans to count on, Mr. Jones needs to turn out more Democrats than he did in 2017. But impeachment complicates the race for him either way, putting him in a no-win situation.Karen Dias, a telecommunications executive in Mobile, sat inside a juice store the other day and said Mr. Trump's election had left her deeply shaken. ""I can't even put into words how embarrassed I was,"" she said.If faced with a choice between two Senate candidates who voted to acquit Mr. Trump, she said forlornly, ""What am I going to do?"" before answering her own question: ""I wouldn't vote."" Noting that in her native country of Brazil people were punished for not voting, she said her conscience would lead her to exercise the freedom she did not have there.In Alabama, Mr. Trump's approval ratings are consistently about 20 points higher than they are nationally, placing it with Wyoming and West Virginia as the states with the highest levels of support for the president.Across much of rural America, the dynamic is similar: The roughly 60 percent of that population that approves of Mr. Trump is demographically distinct from the roughly 40 percent that doesn't.And in Alabama, political divisions are even more closely tethered to race than they are across the rest of the racially segmented South. According to election data analyzed by Seth C. McKee, a political scientist at Texas Tech University, a minuscule number of blacks in Alabama identify as Republicans -- 0.4 percent -- compared with 4.6 percent in the Deep South as a whole. By contrast, 70 percent of whites in Alabama are Republican or Republican-leaning.In the 140-member State Legislature, the parties are split almost entirely along racial lines, with just two white Democrats remaining -- one in the Senate and the other in the House of Representatives.The Republican Party, Dr. McKee said, ""has almost become a counterweight to the black vote in those states,"" with many white voters having come to see it that way. ""The Democratic Party,"" he added, ""is considered the black party.""On the campaign trail, partisan politics have been wedged into the larger debate over Southern identity. Arnold Mooney, a Republican running to challenge Mr. Jones in November, told a crowd in Huntsville last week that the senator was no Alabamian as far as he was concerned. ""He doesn't represent us, he doesn't look like us, and he doesn't even sound like us anymore,"" Mr. Mooney said, drawing laughter from the crowd. (Mr. Jones does, in fact, still speak with a noticeable Southern drawl.)As Ms. Diehl sat in a group of a half-dozen women at lunch last week at the Noble South, the topic of impeachment elicited eye rolls and groans -- all aimed at Democrats. One of the women, who typically votes Republican, said she had voted for Mr. Jones in the last election but would not do so again. A second, who did not vote for Mr. Jones, said she was not impressed by what she had seen from him so far. ""All he did was fall in with Pelosi and Nadler and the rest,"" she scoffed, referring to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York.In fact, Mr. Jones voted with Alabama's Republican senator, Richard Shelby, 69 percent of the time during his first year in office, according to a ProPublica analysis, but has more consistently opposed Republican policies since. He voted against a permanent ban on using federal funding to pay for abortions, for instance, and opposed Brett M. Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court.At a nearby table, Jan Herndon of Fair Hope said she believed both parties had drifted too far from the center.""There's nobody who's middle of the road anymore -- and I just want somebody middle of the road,"" said Ms. Herndon, who did not vote for Mr. Moore or Mr. Jones last time. When she thought about what kind of politician fit her centrist criteria, Mr. Jones was not one -- a sign that no matter how pragmatic he tries to sound on impeachment, many Alabama Republicans cannot get past the fact that he is a Democrat.Emily Cochrane contributed reporting from Washington.PhotographSenator Doug Jones, who has taken a contemplative approach to the impeachment trial, risks losing support from voters in Alabama.

| Jump to first hitHis tweets Monday morning misrepresent his record on health care.President Trump was not in Washington when the Affordable Care Act established a right to health insurance for Americans with pre-existing health conditions. His first legislative priority as president was a bill that would have repealed key parts of Obamacare and weakened such protections. His Justice Department is arguing in court that the entire law should be overturned.His tweets Monday morning, describing himself as ""the person who saved pre-existing conditions,"" contradict this record.It is true that Mr. Trump signed a law eliminating the tax penalties for Americans who go without health insurance -- the so-called individual mandate. That provision was one of the least popular parts of Obamacare. But that legislative change has not improved protections for Americans with pre-existing health conditions. If anything, it has placed them in jeopardy, by forming the basis of a lawsuit that could erase the Affordable Care Act.Here's a brief history of President Trump's record on pre-existing health conditions.Did he pass the Affordable Care Act?No. The president was not in Washington and not in politics when the Affordable Care Act was written, debated and passed in 2009 and 2010. The health law established consumer protections for Americans who buy their insurance, including a rule that health insurers must offer coverage to anyone who wishes to buy it, with prices varying only by region and the age of the customer.Before Obamacare, some states protected people with pre-existing conditions in this way, but most did not. Americans with prior illnesses like cancer, asthma, even acne, often had trouble buying insurance for themselves and their families. One state that did protect people with pre-existing conditions was New York, where the media executive and presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg currently resides and where Mr. Trump did at the time. (Mr. Bloomberg's recent television advertisements, which attack Mr. Trump's health care record, appear to have prompted the tweets.)The Affordable Care Act was a large and complex law, with many provisions that have proved controversial. But the protections for people with pre-existing conditions enjoy widespread public support.Has he tried to weaken pre-existing conditions protections as president?Yes. President Trump's first legislative priority after his election was to ""repeal and replace"" the Affordable Care Act. Republicans in Congress voted on several different bills, but each of them had provisions that would have substantially eroded the current protections for Americans with prior health conditions, by weakening the regulations that make such insurance available, affordable and useful.The bills would have weakened rules that require insurance to cover a standard set of health benefits, for example, and would have established policies that would have raised prices for people with a history of health problems.Those bills didn't pass, in part because of public concern about the erosion of these popular protections. The Republican-led Senate was unable to muster a majority to vote for any of several repeal bills.The president is also responsible for a number of regulatory changes that critics have characterized as ""sabotage"" of Obamacare. Despite these changes, Obamacare markets have remained fairly stable. But economists and actuaries say that some of the changes, which allow the sale of insurance lacking protections for pre-existing conditions, probably raise insurance prices for sicker customers, if only by a little.Has he supported a lawsuit to erase pre-existing health protections?Yes. The Justice Department filed its latest brief in the lawsuit just last week. If the Trump administration wins the case, all of Obamacare would be declared unconstitutional and eliminated.Such a change would cause many changes and could set off widespread disruption throughout the health system. Among the changes, the protection for pre-existing conditions in Obamacare would go away if the courts agreed with the White House's legal position.The basis of this case is the change to the health law that Mr. Trump mentioned in his tweet. By eliminating the tax penalty for people who do not buy insurance, the White House argues that Congress has made all of the health law legally invalid. So far, a Federal District Court judge in Texas has agreed with this argument. An appeals court in New Orleans is waiting for more analysis to decide whether it agrees, but it has signaled openness to the argument.The president has promised on numerous occasions to release a new health plan, which he presumably would champion should he win in court. But he has never released such a plan or even discussed its broad contours.His silence on concrete policy preferences makes it hard to assess his statement that this plan will ""protect your pre-existing conditions."" His record so far has not been strong.What about the Democrats?The party has been consistent and united in defense of Obamacare's pre-existing conditions protections. Preserving them was a centerpiece of 2018 midterm campaigns. Democratic state officials and the House of Representatives have intervened in the Obamacare lawsuit to defend the law.Some Democrats support large changes to the health system. ""Medicare for all,"" a proposal endorsed by more than 100 Democratic House members and two major presidential candidates, would reshape the health system by eliminating private health insurance and replacing it with generous government coverage funded with tax revenues. But by providing identical health coverage for every American, this proposal would do nothing that could plausibly weaken access for people with a history of illness.What does this have to do with Michael Bloomberg?Mr. Bloomberg responded to the president's tweets with sarcasm, focusing on the lawsuit.Mr. Bloomberg is blanketing airwaves with an advertisement on his own health care record. The ad opens with a very critical assessment of the president's health care record, describing it as ""threatening coverage for millions of Americans.""It is worth noting that Mr. Bloomberg also had no role in passing Obamacare. His ad claims credit for cutting the uninsured rate in New York City in half while he was mayor. The main cause of that change was the Affordable Care Act, not any particular action he took.But Mr. Bloomberg has taken no positions that would directly imperil the health law's pre-existing conditions protections. His campaign's health care plan, released recently, would tend to expand insurance access and make insurance more affordable for groups that struggle to buy insurance now. Assessments of various Trump proposals, including legislation that Congress considered and the effects of a legal victory in the lawsuit, support the ""millions"" claim.PhotographPresident Trump during a 2017 ceremony in the Rose Garden after the House of Representatives passed the American Health Care Act, which would have weakened protections for pre-existing health conditions.

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump claims Nancy Pelosi has intentionally undermined Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign by delaying the impeachment trial. Mr. Sanders denounced that theory on Friday.WASHINGTON -- The first version of the conspiracy theory was hatched on Twitter last Friday, Jan. 10.""Don't rule out that the reason Pelosi hasn't sent impeachment to the Senate is to hurt Warren and Sanders, and to help Biden,"" Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary for President George W. Bush, tapped out on his iPad. ""By timing the trial so it takes place during the Iowa lead-up, she has leverage over the liberals.""Mr. Fleischer's message was retweeted 1,400 times.Seven days later, Mr. Fleischer's theory that Speaker Nancy Pelosi was attempting to influence the Democratic primary -- for which there is no evidence -- was being promulgated by President Trump.""They are rigging the election again against Bernie Sanders, just like last time, only even more obviously,"" Mr. Trump tweeted on Friday, claiming his Senate trial was designed to keep Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator, grounded in Washington instead of campaigning in Des Moines ahead of the Feb. 3 caucuses.""Crazy Nancy thereby gives the strong edge to Sleepy Joe Biden, and Bernie is shut out again,"" the president added.An idea that caught fire on Twitter and became grist for Mr. Trump demonstrates how the same echo chamber of right-wing media that boosted him in 2016 is exerting its power again just before the first primary votes are cast in 2020.There was nothing new in terms of the process that got the idea in front of Mr. Trump. But the evolution from online conspiracy theory to Fox News fodder to presidential talking point demonstrated how a world of conservative influencers, Republican lawmakers and online media outlets can drive disinformation through repetition and amplification.Two days after Mr. Fleischer's tweet, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House minority leader, appeared on Maria Bartiromo's show on Fox News and repeated it. ""This is the dirty little secret nobody is talking about: why the Speaker held these papers,"" Mr. McCarthy said on Sunday. ""This benefits Joe Biden. This harms Senator Sanders, who is in first place and could become their nominee.""In fact, Mr. Sanders is not the national front-runner for the nomination and never has been, although he had a narrow lead in a recent poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers. But Mr. Trump's re-election campaign in recent weeks has been seeking to elevate Mr. Sanders, viewing the self-described democratic socialist as the president's ideal Democratic opponent in November.The Trump camp, in turn, is worried about Mr. Biden's competitiveness against the president in Midwestern battleground states, and would like to do anything possible to trip up the moderate former vice president in his tight primary race against the liberal Mr. Sanders.Mr. McCarthy has continued to repeat the theory and profess support for Mr. Sanders, repeating the talking points in an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News. His television commentary was then written up by Breitbart News, the right-wing news and opinion site.On Thursday, The Federalist, a conservative website, ran an article with the headline: ""Is Impeachment Delay How Democrats Are Rigging Iowa Against Bernie Again?"" It said Ms. Pelosi's decision to delay impeachment ""provokes the question whether she is deliberately helping Joe Biden.""One day later, the message had reached the White House, where Mr. Trump, a frequent purveyor of conspiracy theories, presented the idea as a fact.""It's easy to see why Bernie and his supporters would think the establishment is screwing them again,"" said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, noting that the campaign often looks to Mr. Trump's Twitter feed for its daily message.Conspiracies surrounding Mr. Sanders's political fortunes have been a particular fixation for Mr. Trump, dating back four years. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump circulated the false and unsourced claim that an ""analysis"" -- he did not say who wrote it or where it was published -- concluded that Mr. Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if not for superdelegates, the party leaders and officials who were not bound to vote for the winner of their states' primaries or caucuses.At the time, Mr. Trump and his advisers realized the potential political benefit in lobbing these kinds of accusations. Their campaign, which relied heavily on depressing Democratic turnout as a way to win battleground states like Florida and Michigan, stood to gain by fanning the flames of the rivalry between Mr. Sanders and Hillary Clinton and dredging up the bitterness that many Sanders supporters felt over their loss.Even after winning the election, Mr. Trump continued to claim that Mrs. Clinton had somehow robbed Mr. Sanders of victory. When Donna Brazile, the former Democratic National Committee chairwoman, released a memoir in 2017, Mr. Trump inaccurately said the book showed that Mrs. Clinton ""bought the DNC & then stole the Democratic Primary"" from Mr. Sanders.In an interview, Mr. Fleischer said he had not seen the idea about the timing of the impeachment trial anywhere else and had not consulted with anyone when he first pitched it on Twitter. ""I just do my best to realistically assess what's happening in Washington,"" he said. Mr. Fleischer said he believed that Ms. Pelosi does not think Mr. Sanders can beat Mr. Trump in November, and that ""she has one big thing on her mind: that's winning the White House.""He said his tweet took off because ""if it has merit, it starts to gather momentum.""""If it has no merit, it's just another tweet,"" he added.Republican staff members on Capitol Hill said the theory gained traction because of a broader narrative -- pushed by Mr. Sanders's own supporters -- that Mr. Sanders was generally getting a raw deal from the mainstream news media and other candidates in the race.In a statement on Friday, in response to a question from The New York Times about the president's conspiracy tweet, Mr. Sanders denounced the theories. ""Let's be clear about who is rigging what: It is Donald Trump's action to use the power of the federal government for his own political benefit that is the cause of the impeachment trial,"" he said. ""His transparent attempts to divide Democrats will not work, and we are going to unite to sweep him out of the White House in November.""Ms. Pelosi's team has also made it clear she was not trying to meddle in the nominating process.""Impeachment has nothing to do with politics or the presidential race,"" a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi, Drew Hammill, wrote on Twitter this week, responding to Mr. McCarthy's accusation. ""As usual, the Minority Leader has no idea what he's talking about.""On Friday, he added: ""Regardless, Senator Sanders isn't the only senator running, so this doesn't make any sense.""Annie Karni reported from Washington, and Jeremy W. Peters from New York.A journey from Twitter to Fox News to the president's feed.PhotographPresident Trump claimed without evidence that Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, was ""rigging"" the Democratic presidential primary.

| Jump to first hitAre Americans as divided and siloed as the Republicans and Democrats are in Washington? People visiting the capital shared a range of views on impeachment.WASHINGTON -- The impeachment of President Trump has played out like a searing snapshot of the partisan divide, the two parties mostly inhabiting turf so different they might as well be on different planets.We asked Americans visiting the National Mall last weekend to share their thoughts on impeachment. The goal was to see if people's statements broke down as neatly and predictably on partisan lines as the vast majority of the views expressed in Congress.One thing was clear: Almost everyone agreed that impeachment has been a fraught process that has further divided Americans and made them reconsider where we are as a nation. Alas, that may be all we agree on.-- Carol Morasch, 71 --Ms. Morasch is a retired social worker from Fairfax City, Va. Though she voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, she is not registered with a party. She came to Washington to protest how the Senate was conducting the impeachment trial.The way everything gets twisted, you know, whatever your belief is, you can make that the truth. So I don't have a lot of hope. And it's sad. That's the frightening thing. I'm 71 and it's sad not to have hope at this age.You know, I was thinking about the Pledge of Allegiance and the national anthem when we go to the ballgames. And the last line, America, ""The land of the free and the home of the brave."" And I thought, what happened?And I do think he's going to be re-elected. I'm just afraid for my grandchildren.-- Mike Mullis, 70 --Mr. Mullis is a retired sports administration official from Houston. He is a Republican.I don't think he did anything wrong. If you scrutinized every president and every president's tight-knit circle, could you say something regarding something that happened? There'd be a lot of presidents that would be scrutinized under that. Ultimately, the Democrats are not going to benefit at all.I have always felt good about the country. I think sometimes politics gets in the way of everything that really needs to be done. All the representatives are supposed to represent their constituents, and they really haven't done that, in order to get new legislation done since Trump's been elected. Actually, the citizens of the United States are the ones who have been hurt by this.-- Anthony Williams, 27 --Mr. Williams is an entrepreneur who was visiting Washington from Philadelphia. He said he was ""not a fan of Trump.""I just felt over all it's kind of sketchy. It doesn't give the American people, or people globally, confidence about where America is headed.I don't think they're giving the trial a chance to play out if they're not bringing witnesses. If you're not bringing witnesses, you have something to hide. So it's very suspicious why they don't want to bring witnesses. Him not bringing witnesses forward is like saying you can hit somebody with your car but get away with it at the same time.-- Ragan Fletcher, 20 --Ms. Fletcher is a sophomore at Belmont University, in Nashville, who is studying music business. She is from Tulsa, Okla., and a registered Republican who said that if the election were today, she would ""vote for Trump.""I don't think there's enough to convict him for. If it's a question of character, I don't think it's enough for impeachment. I think the Senate's so polarized right now. I don't think the Republicans are going to be willing to impeach him.I feel like, if anything, less hopeful, not more hopeful. It's just upsetting that we're at that place right now where we have to go through a trial in the first place. The fact that we have to go through this as a country isn't a positive thing.-- Jimmy Hadden, 72, and Ollye Hadden, 70 --Mr. Hadden is a veteran of the Vietnam War from North Augusta, S.C., and was in Washington for a funeral at Arlington National Cemetery. Politically, he leans Republican. He voted for Mr. Trump in 2016.Look at the economy, everything is great. I think it's been a sham. It was a basic phone call. We give too much money to foreign countries anyway. He was right to hold it for corruption. I think he's done the right thing. I don't think what he did was corrupt. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer were just wasting time.Ms. Hadden also voted for Mr. Trump and said she planned to do so again in November.I think that impeachment has hurt the country because if you can impeach him, I just think it's wrong. We're just glad it's over. We're America. We need everybody to get along. Why can't they?-- Ella Williams, 35 --Ms. Williams was visiting Washington for the weekend from Columbus, Ohio, where she works in information technology. She is an independent who voted for Mrs. Clinton in 2016.I think the G.O.P., they have a lot to lose, and they don't really want to spend the time to invest in a new candidate. I think it will probably hurt Democrats, which is unfortunate to say. I think at this point people just feel like it's a waste of time and a waste of money, and they feel like he's gotten away with so much anyway.At this point I just feel like it's created more division in the country. At this point, the Democrats just need to put their energy behind getting really strong candidates for the 2020 election.-- Lee Gately, 52 --Mr. Gately is a project manager in HVAC sales in Raleigh, N.C. He said he tended to view himself as a ""little bit of a moderate.""I don't think President Trump did anything wrong. I think he was looking after the taxpayers' dollars on the way they would be spent; he wanted to make sure to spend appropriately. He wanted to make sure it wasn't wasted and involved in any corruption.It's not about the American people anymore. I think the Democrats are just making it all politics. I just want to see more for the American people.-- Kelly Akins, 41 --Ms. Akins is from Norman, Okla., and is an account manager at a software company. She is a Democrat who was in Washington to tour the United States Capitol and witness the impeachment trial.I think that any president and actually any political appointee who uses their office to gain personal benefit and uses resources outside of the government to try to coerce and bribe a foreign government to benefit him and or his election should be removed, and actually never allowed to serve again, in any public capacity.We actually were touring the U.S. Capitol today. We were going to go into the Senate impeachment trial to watch, and I was standing in line. So where have we come to in politics? President Trump and all of the elected officials -- who typically are Republicans -- who support and turn a blind eye to his behavior, his character, the way that he bullies people, it's just we're losing our democracy based on corruption, on bullying from the highest places in office. It's just really sad to me, and I actually was tearing up in the line. I had to leave because I didn't want to witness it. It's just disgusting.-- Sam Riddle, 49 --Mr. Riddle is an equipment company manager based in Charleston, W.Va., who identifies as a Republican.It appears it's completely partisan, mostly hearsay. And what evidence has been available to the general public has not been convincing me at all. I believe that all of the efforts that have been spent on this could have been much better spent on a lot of other issues this country has going on right now, such as the economy, the China trade deals, things President Trump's trying to work on.I think it's been a distraction. I feel like if we all got together and made some compromises and quit building walls between each other, we could probably get a lot more done in this country. It seems harder to do that today than it's ever been. And that part is troubling.-- Angela Peebles, 53 --Ms. Peebles is a cabinetmaker from Prineville, Ore., and identifies as a Republican. She said the impeachment against Mr. Trump -- and overall partisan politics -- had left her worried about the country's future.I don't really think there was anything to impeach him on. No crime. Politics, but no crime. I think it was purely political. And I don't think I'm really right-wing, but I just don't think they proved it. I do think that political favoring is wrong, but I think everybody does that. But I don't think it raised the bar of coercion or bribery. But you're not going to tell me every other president hasn't said, ""Hey, you do this for me,"" you know, the idea?It scares me if we get, let's say, a Democratic president, House and Senate, or something, it just scares me what could happen. I think we're so political now. It worries me that there's not enough reasonable people to compromise. It's your way or the highway lately.Kitty Bennett contributed research.Photograph(PHOTOGRAPHS BY JUSTIN T.

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump's decision to strike a top Iranian general has upended Congress's priorities, thrusting matters of war and peace into the spotlight.WASHINGTON -- President Trump's abrupt decision to kill Iran's top security commander has reshuffled the already fraught political dynamic around impeachment and thrust matters of war and peace into the middle of an election-year debate over whether to remove Mr. Trump from office.As Congress reconvenes on Monday, the specter of escalating hostilities with Iran and a searing debate over the justification behind Mr. Trump's action will take center stage on Capitol Hill. The unexpected turn of events has added a volatile new element to the pitched fight over Mr. Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate.For Republicans, the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the leader of Iran's elite Quds Force, fueled a new line of defense of the president, as they argued that Democrats' effort to oust Mr. Trump while he tended to matters of national security was irresponsible.""Think of the contrast,"" Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the top House Republican, wrote on Twitter on Sunday. ""While Democrats are trying to remove President Trump from office, the President is focused on removing terrorists from the face of the earth.""Democratic leaders insisted the two issues must not be interwoven, and said that lawmakers were obligated to follow through with the impeachment process even as they debated the way forward on Iran. Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday evening told Democratic lawmakers in a letter that the House would act swiftly and vote later in the week on a resolution to limit the scope of the president's war-making powers in Iran.Many of their rank and file have charged that Mr. Trump authorized the strike precisely to distract attention from the charges at the center of his impeachment.""Congress has to do both of our constitutional responsibilities,"" said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee.""One, to protect the American people and be a coequal branch of government with the administration to make sure that we keep Americans safe,"" he added on NBC, referring to Iran. ""Secondly, we also have to take on the responsibility of what's going to come over at some point from the House, and that's to conduct a full and fair trial.""Related or not, the rapid developments in recent days mean that Congress will grapple simultaneously in the coming weeks with two of its most consequential constitutional duties: the power to impeach and to weigh matters of war. The outcome will clarify the legislative branch's appetite for checking an expansive presidency and will also likely play a continuing role in Mr. Trump's fight for re-election.The timing and outlook for the president's impeachment trial were already murky. In a pair of votes in December, the House impeached Mr. Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The charges stem from his bid to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, while withholding nearly $400 million of military aid.Ms. Pelosi has refused to transmit the charges against Mr. Trump to the Senate, in a bid to give Senate Democrats more leverage as they try to force Republicans to agree to call administration witnesses and gain access to more documents. The president blocked administration officials from testifying in the House inquiry and refused to turn over documents that impeachment investigators requested, prompting the obstruction charge.Now, the question is whether the coming debate on Iran will affect the calculations by Democrats and Republicans strategizing over the terms and length of a trial.Democrats on the left argue that the impulses that led Mr. Trump to strike General Suleimani are themselves grounds for his removal.""The issues are connected,"" said Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, who sponsored legislation to block Mr. Trump from launching an unauthorized strike against Iran. ""It shows the same reckless pattern of policymaking that he engaged in with Ukraine. It's no longer a matter of standing up for the rule of law and the Constitution. This is a matter of safeguarding our national security and peace because a president that disregards constitutional processes can pose a huge risk to stability and peace.""Senators spent the year-end holidays preparing for the impeachment trial, a showdown over the fate of Mr. Trump's presidency that could consume parts of January and February.Lawmakers and aides close to Ms. Pelosi say she has not yet made up her mind on how or when to proceed, and said foreign policy would not affect her thinking. A decision could come as soon as this week, when House lawmakers reconvene on Tuesday and the speaker holds a series of meetings with her leadership team.But the strike on the Iranian general was preoccupying many lawmakers. Some Democrats, calling the action unauthorized and illegal, made clear over the weekend that they intended to try to curtail Mr. Trump's ability to strike Iran in the future. After the White House on Saturday sent Congress an unusual, completely classified notification of the drone strike, Ms. Pelosi said it raised ""serious and urgent questions"" about the decision.""Congress and I will do everything I can to assert our authority,"" Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said Sunday on ABC. ""We do not need this president either bumbling or impulsively getting us into a major war.""But in a clear signal that he has no interest in consulting with Congress on his military moves or strategy, Mr. Trump suggested on Sunday that lawmakers should monitor social media to discern how he plans to proceed.""These Media Posts will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any U.S. person or target, the United States will quickly & fully strike back, & perhaps in a disproportionate manner,"" the president tweeted. ""Such legal notice is not required, but is given nevertheless!""Senators are expected to receive a full briefing from administration officials in the coming week on the strike. An all-members briefing in the House has yet to be scheduled, according to a senior Democratic aide.""As members of Congress, our first responsibility is to keep the American people safe,"" Ms. Pelosi said in a letter announcing the war-powers vote. ""For this reason, we are concerned that the administration took this action without the consultation of Congress and without respect for Congress's war powers granted to it by the Constitution.""Senators could be forced to vote on a similar resolution as soon as mid-January.That timing could collide directly with an impeachment trial, an all-consuming proceeding that brings other Senate work to a halt.Though they did not explicitly connect the two issues, Republicans have begun looking for ways to force Ms. Pelosi's hand and move the trial along. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said on Sunday that he would seek a long-shot change to the Senate rules to compel the House to bring its case forward so it could be dispensed with quickly.""If we don't get the articles this week, then we need to take matters in our own hands and change the rules. Deem them to be delivered to the Senate,"" he said on Fox News.In an interview on Sunday evening, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 House Republican, said that the strike ""puts more pressure"" on Ms. Pelosi to put aside impeachment and focus on ""things that really matter.""""It's time to let the Senate do its job and move on because there are real, significant issues that the country is facing right now -- both foreign and domestic,"" Mr. Scalise said.Democratic leaders insisted on Sunday that Congress owed it to the country to air what they believe are serious charges of high crimes and misdemeanors against Mr. Trump. They chastised Republicans, saying they were seeking to use the threat of war to paper over the president's wrongdoing.""It's complicated, but I do think they are separate responsibilities,"" Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, said in an interview. ""And while the president may hope that there is some effort to set aside the impeachment while we try to figure out how to avoid going to war with Iran, we have to do both at once.""Across the political spectrum, Democrats' response to the escalation in Iraq and Iran underscored the deep mistrust between their party and Mr. Trump. Some liberal lawmakers have begun questioning whether Mr. Trump's decision to kill General Suleimani could have been influenced by his desire to neutralize the impeachment threat against him.""It is a reasonable question to ask, particularly when the administration, immediately after having taken this decision, offers a bunch of contradictory explanations for what's going on,"" Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, one of the Democrats vying for her party's nomination to challenge Mr. Trump, said Sunday on CNN.Liberals like Mr. Khanna may also push the debate toward a place Ms. Pelosi had sought to avoid by conflating specific impeachment charges the speaker argues are separate from Mr. Trump's other behavior with foreign policy decisions they do not like.About a dozen progressive advocacy groups planned to converge on the Senate daily beginning on Monday to demand Mr. Trump's removal from office, rallying not just around the charges against him but against military escalation.For now, at least, the debate over the procedures of a Senate trial has continued on its own track. With his counterpart, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, unwilling to negotiate, Mr. Schumer on Sunday began explicitly appealing to a handful of moderate Republicans who Democrats believe could join them in voting to call witnesses once the trial begins.""McConnell will not go for a fair trial,"" Mr. Schumer said on ABC. ""You can't have a fair trial without witnesses and documents, particularly those that were right at the scene of the charges. But four Republican senators can join us.""PhotographAfter the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani of Iran, Senator Chuck Schumer, left, said that Democrats would try to curtail the president's ability to strike again.

| Jump to first hitThe president traveled to Wildwood, N.J., to return a political favor for a former moderate Democrat who last month switched parties and pledged his ""undying support.""WILDWOOD, N.J. -- President Trump told his supporters at a raucous rally on Tuesday evening that Representative Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, who recently left the Democratic Party, was a symbol of the future. Without evidence, he said that an increasing number of Americans were ""disgusted"" by congressional Democrats who, he said, are ""obsessed with demented hoaxes, this crazy witch hunt and deranged partisan crusades.""""They've spent the last three years and probably even before I came down on that beautiful escalator with our beautiful future first lady,"" Mr. Trump said, ""trying to overthrow the last election, and we will make sure that they face another crushing defeat in the next election.""The president traveled to Wildwood, a boardwalk town on the southern end of the Jersey Shore that is deserted in the winter, to return a political favor for Mr. Van Drew, a former moderate Democrat who last month switched parties and pledged his ""undying support"" for Mr. Trump. Mr. Van Drew had also been a strong anti-impeachment voice in the House before he made the switch, saying the Republican Party was a ""better fit.""Mr. Van Drew said he had requested a rally when Mr. Trump asked how he could help.""They're trying to steal that election,"" Mr. Trump said, ""and Jeff had the guts to defy the left-wing fanatics in his own party and to stand tall in defense of our Constitution, our freedom and democracy itself.""At the rally, Mr. Van Drew was immediately embraced by Trump supporters as one of their own. Mr. Trump lost New Jersey by 14 points to Hillary Clinton, his Democratic challenger in 2016, but the rally drew thousands who hope to change the political fortunes for local Republicans, starting with Mr. Van Drew's re-election.""He has the conservative values that we want,"" James Toto, a councilman in Somers Point, N.J., said as he joined the line outside. ""He has conservative values more so than some Republicans do. He wants to make sure people can be independent and on their own.""Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's communications director, said that campaign officials were betting that Mr. Van Drew represented the type of politician that moderate Democrats might want to hear more from.""We think a lot of Democrats across the country are looking for a new home,"" Mr. Murtaugh said at the rally.Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, a former 2020 presidential candidate, said the opposite in a fund-raising email sent to supporters of his Senate re-election campaign.""Trump will be spreading his platform of hatred and bigotry to help re-elect Jeff Van Drew, the congressman who shamefully switched his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican during the impeachment process,"" the email said.The rally location -- essentially empty in January -- gave attendees an opportunity to bundle up and engage in a spiritual takeover of the area for a few days. Beachside motels opened up to board an influx of supporters.On Monday evening, the Trump faithful overran local bars, singing renditions of ""Sweet Caroline"" late into the night. Hundreds of people were lined up outside the Wildwoods Convention Center, staking out their claim to the front of the line with plastic chairs. Near the boardwalk, Trump-themed recreational vehicles were parked in the shadow of dormant roller coasters.""There is nobody in the middle of winter,"" the president remarked, ""and those streets are packed all the way back to the airplane, probably.""Mr. Trump, who on his way out of Washington did not stop to answer questions as his impeachment defense team wrapped up its case in the Senate, used his time at the rally podium to fight back -- and to train the spotlight back on his own re-election campaign. He promised that his campaign would be signing up ""millions and millions"" of registered independent and Democratic voters, and bragged about his poll numbers.""I had the best polls that I've ever had since being elected,"" he said, ""the best we've ever had. Remember, I used to go over polls, but I only used to talk about them when I was doing well otherwise.""The president's approval rating has hovered at around 43 percent, but an increasing number of Americans are voicing support for hearing witnesses in his impeachment trial.Mr. Trump is facing several roadblocks in his administration's quest for a speedy acquittal in the Senate. His former national security adviser, John R. Bolton, wrote in a book draft that Mr. Trump had held up aid to Ukraine to further his political ambitions, making it harder for Senate Republicans to abstain from requesting that witnesses offer further testimony.On Tuesday evening, cracks in the united front that the White House has tried so hard to build with Senate Republicans started showing when Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, told a closed-door meeting of Republicans that he did not currently have the votes to block Democrats from calling witnesses at the trial.While he targeted the topic of impeachment at times, calling out individual Democrats like Speaker Nancy Pelosi by name, Mr. Trump's hourlong address largely hewed to the same red-meat themes he has introduced to his base.""I never even knew the swamp was this bad,"" Mr. Trump, who frequently attends high-dollar donor events, told the rapt crowd. ""A lot of bad people in the swamp. Bad people in the swamp.""Mr. Trump introduced several inaccurate claims, including falsely accusing the Obama administration of choosing not to end the AIDS epidemic -- even though President Barack Obama directed billions to accelerate efforts to find a cure.He also claimed that the Republican Party would protect patients with pre-existing medical conditions. ""We are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will,"" said Mr. Trump, whose administration has taken steps to weaken such protections.PhotographPresident Trump held a rally in Wildwood, N.J., as a favor to a congressman who switched parties.

| Jump to first hitSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, on his first visit to sub-Saharan Africa, promotes partnerships with American companies, but finds China's presence pervasive.NAIROBI, Kenya -- When U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo landed in Ethiopia as part of his first foray into sub-Saharan Africa, he arrived in a city shaped by the same adversary that he had come to preach against: China.Mr. Pompeo and his delegation were received on Monday night at the Bole International Airport, one of Africa's biggest, expanded in part by Chinese funds. His entourage passed through the capital, Addis Ababa, where Beijing has built highways and factories, and financed a metro system and a multibillion dollar railway to neighboring Djibouti.On Tuesday, Mr. Pompeo met the chairman of the African Union at its towering headquarters, built and paid for by China at a cost of $200 million.Almost two years since President Trump named him America's top diplomat, Mr. Pompeo has traveled to Africa to convince its leaders to shun Chinese investments and, instead, look to Washington and American companies for collaboration.But he has come to Senegal, Angola and Ethiopia without offering any major new American government investment, initiatives or assistance. Instead he promoted American companies, boasting that their practices are superior and motives purer when compared to China's.""When we come, we hire Angolans,"" Mr. Pompeo said at a news conference in the Angolan capital, Luanda. ""We do high-quality work. It's transparent.""""Not every nation that comes here to invest does that,"" Mr. Pompeo said. ""There's no political objective.""Mr. Pompeo's efforts to contain China's role in Africa come as the Trump administration is sending mixed signals about its engagement with the continent.Amid growing extremist violence, the United States is weighing proposals to reduce or completely pull out its forces from West Africa, drawing sharp criticism from both allies and lawmakers.In early February, President Trump announced an expanded travel ban that now affects nearly a quarter of Africa's 1.2 billion people -- including Nigeria, the continent's biggest economy and its most populous nation.As both China and Russia step up their presence and investments, the United States has proposed cutting aid and development funding to African states -- which still dwarfs that of China and Russia. President Trump himself has also faced censure for reportedly calling African states ""shithole countries,"" drawing outraged responses across the continent and potentially harming strategic American interests.The Trump administration's Africa policy has focused almost exclusively on countering the influence of China and Russia, said Aubrey Hruby, a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council's Africa Center.While previous American presidents sent mixed cues about their depth of commitment to Africa, Ms. Hruby said, they also had signature programs that reflected their visions. This included Barack Obama's initiative to boost electricity access, George W. Bush's program to address the H.I.V./AIDS epidemic, and Bill Clinton's signing of the landmark African Growth and Opportunity Act in 2000, a cornerstone of the U.S.-Africa trade relationship.The Trump administration, she said, is yet to find ""a positive focus to promote in Africa.""Over the past two decades, China has deepened its reach in Africa, financing large infrastructure projects like roads and a railway in Kenya, opening up a military base in Djibouti, deploying peacekeepers in South Sudan and Liberia, and spreading its culture and language by funding Confucius Institutes across the continent.The first trip that China's foreign minister takes each year is to Africa, and other senior Chinese officials regularly visit countries across the continent to solidify relations. African leaders themselves have often trooped to Beijing. Paul Kagame, the president of Rwanda, described the partnership between Africa and China as not just ""equal"" but ""a revolutionary posture in world affairs.""Since Mr. Trump took office, African leaders look at America and see signs of its neglect. Over three years, Mr. Pompeo and his predecessor Rex Tillerson have visited fewer than ten African countries -- a decline from the nearly two dozen African states visited by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who served under President Obama for four years.In light of this, ""U.S. government officials just don't seem to understand that talking trash about the Chinese in Africa, regardless of its merit, just does not help their cause,"" said Eric Olander, co-founder of a research initiative, The China Africa Project.In addition, Mr. Pompeo's suggestion that Chinese companies operating in Angola do not hire locals was not accurate, Mr. Olander said, noting that locals got a majority of the jobs on Chinese projects.Beijing has been accused of offering cheap, no-strings-attached loans to African governments that are in dire need of financing to boost their economies -- with the sting of default coming when those nations can't repay those debts. China critics and Western officials, including Mr. Pompeo himself, have said these lending programs amount to a ""debt trap,"" pose a risk to the sovereignty of African states, and could push debt limits to unsustainable levels. Chinese officials have fervently denied these claims, and cast their engagement with Africa as a win-win.In Angola, which is in the midst of a massive corruption scandal involving the former president's daughter, Mr. Pompeo railed against the ""destructive"" nature of corruption and its impact on ordinary people. Yet analysts say that this message may ring hollow among Africans well aware that President Trump just underwent an impeachment trial and has been accused of steering U.S. government business to his own hotels and resorts.But it may be that Mr. Pompeo's trip will convince some African leaders that the Trump administration is now ready to focus on Africa. His visit, said Addisu Lashitew, a research fellow with the Brookings Institution, a research organization in Washington, ""testifies to a modicum of interest in the continent"" and signals a step toward resetting the relationship with Africa in anticipation of President Trump's re-election.This is especially true in the choice to visit Ethiopia, a strategic American ally that is undergoing sweeping changes under Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. A fast-growing economy, Addis Ababa plays a critical security role in the Horn of Africa, is home to the African Union, is liberalizing its economy and privatizing key sectors like telecom. The country has extensive relations with China, but has engaged the United States in trying to resolve a dispute with Egypt over a dam that Ethiopia has built on the Nile.American officials traveling with Mr. Pompeo said on Tuesday they were encouraged that Mr. Abiy hasn't deviated from his commitment to reforms, and commended his efforts to renegotiate Ethiopia's debt with China.Besides the two secretaries of state, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and Mr. Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump have visited Ethiopia in the past three years, demonstrating the country's ongoing significance no matter the American administration, Mr. Lashitew said.While ""Chinese finance and investment is far from perfect,"" Mr. Lashitew said, ""it is not fair"" that Mr. Pompeo ask African leaders to choose between the U.S. and China. ""If the U.S. is a genuine development partner of Africa, it must respect the right of African countries to partner with any other country that can help them grow their economies, including China,"" he said.In trying to compete with China in Africa, Ms. Hruby said that the United States should focus on sectors where it has unique advantages, including education, finance, media and entertainment. The N.B.A.'s push into Africa, for instance, could act as a tool to attract support in Africa.""In terms of building U.S. influence in African markets and enhancing brand USA,"" Ms. Hruby said, ""Black Panther,"" the superhero film based on the fictional African nation of Wakanda, and ""the new N.B.A. Africa league have done far more than a handful of cabinet level trips ever could.""Simon Marks contributed reporting from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.PhotographSecretary of State Mike Pompeo with the prime minister of Ethiopia, Abiy Ahmed, on Tuesday.

| Jump to first hitAppearing before cameras sometimes multiple times a day to talk about the outbreak, the president has offered rosy assessments and unproven or even false assertions.WASHINGTON -- At a campaign rally this week in North Carolina, President Trump reassured the crowd that he had jawboned the nation's pharmaceutical companies into quickly tackling the coronavirus.""They're going to have vaccines, I think, relatively soon,"" he said.But ""soon"" was correct only if it meant 12 to 18 months from now.Both health officials and drug industry executives have repeatedly told Mr. Trump that a vaccine was still a long way off. Yet by promising a vaccine ""soon,"" the president almost certainly misled at least some of the public into thinking a solution to the outbreak was just around the corner.In confronting the first major health crisis of his presidency, Mr. Trump has made himself the primary source of information to the public with mixed results. Appearing before cameras sometimes multiple times a day to talk about the coronavirus, he has offered a consistently rosier assessment of the situation than health experts and has put forth unproven or even false assertions.He originally claimed that his travel restrictions on China would ""shut it down,"" preventing the spread of the virus to the United States, and he has undercounted the number of infections as they have emerged. He has suggested that the virus would most likely ""go away"" by spring, a prediction born more of hope than knowledge. And he has minimized any economic effects.""The market's in great shape,"" he said after stocks plummeted on Tuesday.At times, Mr. Trump has been corrected, gently but unmistakably, by the health experts standing next to him at the microphones. On Tuesday, they brought him to the National Institutes of Health for a tour and a Virus 101 seminar of sorts, flashing slides on a screen to make points they wanted him to absorb and repeat to the public -- including the timetable for a possible vaccine that, while fast for this sort of drug development, remains in the distance.""This isn't political, left-right, this is a scientific thing,"" said Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, the vice provost of global initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania and a health policy adviser to President Barack Obama. ""The politicians are learning on the job. Let the experts talk about it. They're the definitive ones and don't make statements that have no basis in fact or are extrapolations of fact that aren't reasonable.""Over the past week, Mr. Trump at times has seemed to follow some of that advice, appearing with experts and inviting them to take the microphone. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the renowned director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has joined the president for public statements and denied that he has been muzzled.But Mr. Trump has made clear he will be the main voice on the coronavirus. He addressed it publicly four times on Tuesday alone, while cameras were barred from the daily briefing by Vice President Mike Pence, who is managing the response along with Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services.""I think it's fair to say that President Trump has struggled, and that's not surprising,"" said Matthew Seeger, a dean at Wayne State University who has written extensively on crisis communications. ""One of the real challenges we've seen is a tendency to over-reassure. There is a tendency for us to say, 'Don't worry, everything is going to be fine, don't panic.""'Mr. Trump and his allies said the problem was the other way around, that the president's critics were too eager to proclaim doom and gloom for the purpose of hurting him politically as he headed into his re-election campaign. The president last week went so far as to call Democratic criticism the ""new hoax,"" although he later stressed that he did not mean that the outbreak itself was a hoax.""Unfortunately, what we are seeing from the left and some in the media is a disgusting effort to distract and disturb the American people with fearful rhetoric and palace intrigue,"" said Judd Deere, a White House spokesman. ""The coronavirus is a serious situation that is changing hourly, which is exactly why Vice President Pence, Secretary Azar and the entire task force continue to lead a whole-of-government response.""At the start of the crisis in China, Mr. Trump acted quickly and decisively to curb travel from there to the United States, a move that Dr. Fauci said on Tuesday had ""really saved us a lot of hurt.""But the president at first overstated how effective it would be, boasting to reporters last month that he had ""pretty much shut it down coming in from China.""It is unclear exactly how the virus entered the United States and whether it was carried from China, but Mr. Trump may have left the impression that he had successfully cut off its path into the United States.Mr. Trump has also misstated the number of Americans with the virus. He said on Saturday that 22 people in the country were infected, but at that time, 70 cases had been reported. He also incorrectly described the first United States citizen to die of the virus as ""a wonderful woman,"" when the victim was actually a man. (The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention later tweeted that Mr. Trump had been given inaccurate information.)The president has theorized that the virus is likely to dissipate during warm weather. ""A lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat -- as the heat comes in,"" he said. ""Typically, that will go away in April."" Many health experts say that it is true of some strains of influenza and may be possible in this case, but that too little is known about the coronavirus for such predictions.At a news conference last week, the president spoke with an optimism that even then appeared misguided. Asked whether schools should prepare for the virus's wider spread, Mr. Trump played down the prospect. ""I don't think it's going to come to that,"" he said, ""especially with the fact that we're going down, not up. We're going very substantially down, not up.""""We have it so well under control,"" he added.More recently, Mr. Trump has taken to suggesting that drug makers are making rapid progress toward a vaccine. ""They're moving along very quickly. All of the pharmaceutical companies are moving along very quickly,"" he said on Saturday and then repeated similar sentiments on Monday after meeting with drug company executives.But health officials caution that, even under the best circumstances, a vaccine would most likely not be available for widespread use before mid- to late-2021. Dr. Fauci made a point of emphasizing that more than once on Tuesday, using the slide show at the National Institutes of Health to demonstrate that while safety trials on a vaccine will begin soon and progress has been strikingly fast compared with past health crises, it will take considerable time to move to mass production if it proves safe.""Very soon, we'll be sticking the first person with the vaccine,"" Dr. Fauci said at a later appearance with the president after landing by helicopter back at the White House. ""But I want to caution everybody: That's only the first stage of the development of the vaccine."" Over all, he said, ""the whole process is going to take a year, a year and a half at least.""Mr. Trump did not quarrel with that, but urged Dr. Fauci to tell reporters about the progress toward ""therapeutics"" that will combat the infection once a person has it.Dr. Fauci noted that two large trials for such medication are underway in China and the United States that could move more quickly than a vaccine. ""That may take three months. That may take five months. I don't know,"" he said. ""When the trial is over and they evaluate the data, if the drug works, then you'll be able to apply it.""With fears of the coronavirus sending waves of concern through the country, Mr. Trump has focused as much on the economic consequences as the medical ones. He repeatedly demanded that the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to bolster the economy, but when the central bank did so on Tuesday, investors were unimpressed and markets tumbled another 3 percent.Some critics have complained that the administration's message on the markets has been ill considered. Larry Kudlow, the director of the White House National Economic Council, has urged Americans to ""buy the dip,"" saying that ""stocks look pretty cheap to me.""But some of his predecessors said such boosterism of markets from the White House set a dangerous precedent. ""Making these kinds of confident assertions about the unknowable will always lead to substantial errors that undercut officials' credibility,"" said Larry Summers, who held Mr. Kudlow's post under Mr. Obama and served as Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton. ""This is one kind of high-order blunder.""The White House has bristled at the criticism, seeing it as insincere point scoring. Seeking to push back, Mr. Pence's office has begun compiling praise for the administration's handling of the crisis and sending it out to supporters and news organizations.""Shame on Dems for trying to play politics with the Coronavirus,"" Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the second-ranking Republican in the House, wrote on Twitter in a message circulated by the White House. ""The health and safety of Americans should be everyone's top priority. Period.""Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.PhotographPresident Trump visiting the National Institutes of Health's vaccine research center in Bethesda, Md., on Tuesday.

| Jump to first hitForeign affairs have played a strictly limited role so far in the Democratic primary, but the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani could reshape the contest.The American strike in Baghdad that killed the Iranian general Qassim Suleimani thrust foreign policy to the center of the Democratic presidential race, drawing expressions of grave concern from the leading candidates and stoking a new debate in the party about the American military presence in the Middle East.The party's presidential field reacted to the attack with a measure of unity, at least on the surface level, condemning General Suleimani's role directing violence against Americans but criticizing what they called the Trump administration's penchant for reckless action and the threat of all-out war.But during a series of campaign events on Friday, the top Democrats began to signal their differences on matters of national security, opening the way for what could become the party's most serious conversation of the race about war and peace. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., whose long diplomatic résumé and global stature have been seen as crucial assets to his campaign, seized the occasion to remind voters of his experience, pressing them to elect a president who could ""command the world stage with no on-the-job training.""Delivering stern remarks in Dubuque, Iowa, Mr. Biden said President Trump was risking nuclear proliferation and ""direct conflict with Iran."" On Twitter, he described the president as ""erratic, unstable and dangerously incompetent.""""The threat to American lives and interests in the region and around the world are enormous,"" Mr. Biden said in Iowa.But elsewhere in the state, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont called not just for the replacement of an impulsive president but for a wholesale overhaul of American foreign policy in the Middle East. Opening a town-hall-style meeting in Anamosa, Iowa, with a somber address, Mr. Sanders urged a total military pullback from the region and noted at length that he had forcefully opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, without explicitly mentioning that Mr. Biden had voted to authorize the war.""We need to firmly commit to ending the U.S. military presence in the Middle East in an orderly manner, not through a tweet,"" Mr. Sanders said, reiterating his past calls for a pullout from Afghanistan and an end to cooperation with Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. ""Instead of provoking more volatility in the region, the United States must use its power, its wealth and its influence to bring the regional powers to the table to resolve conflicts.""And Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who in the past has urged a pullout of all American combat troops from the Middle East, echoed that sentiment on Twitter, warning that the country was ""on the brink of yet another war"" and urging Americans to mobilize against military escalation. ""No more Middle East Wars,"" she wrote.Both Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren used the word ""assassination"" to describe the killing of General Suleimani, a term that has significant legal and diplomatic implications. One of the prominent centrists in the race, Michael R. Bloomberg, rebuked Mr. Sanders for that description, calling it ""outrageous."" He described the felled general as a fair target, questioning instead whether Mr. Trump was prepared for the fallout.Whether military matters come to dominate the primary, in the remaining month before the Iowa caucuses, is likely to depend on events in Iraq and Iran -- and perhaps in neighboring countries -- and how severe and visible any ensuing clash with Iran turns out to be. Foreign affairs have so far played a strictly limited role in the Democratic race.There have been major debate-stage duels over health care, taxation, immigration, criminal justice and gun control, but only glancing disagreements about the role of the United States abroad and the proper way to resolve American military engagements in the Middle East and Central Asia.On Friday, much of the Democratic field proceeded with -- and recommended -- caution. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota called on the Trump administration to consult with Congress about a ""strategy for preventing a wider conflict. ""And in North Conway, N.H., Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., called the Baghdad attack ""an extremely provocative act,"" noting that Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush had both considered but opted against attempting to kill General Suleimani.""If we have learned nothing else from the Middle East in the last 20 years, it's that taking out a bad guy is not a good idea unless you are ready for what's coming next,"" said Mr. Buttigieg, who referred several times to his own service in the military.The possibility of a new and protracted conflict abroad could well reshape the general election, even beyond the Democratic race. Mr. Trump ran for president on a pledge to pull back the United States from foreign wars, drawing support from unconventional quarters for a Republican because of the perception that he would pursue an ""America First"" policy of relative isolationism and national self-interest.But Mr. Trump had already drawn criticism from his Democratic rivals, and even within his own party, for presiding over a chaotic pullback from Syria, and the eruption of large-scale violence in Iran and Iraq could profoundly complicate his aim to seek a second term on a message of peace and prosperity. After Thursday's attack, the Trump administration announced that thousands more troops would deploy to the region in anticipation of Iranian action.At Democratic campaign events on Friday, there was already a strong ripple of anxiety running through the primary electorate, as voters who turned out to see several candidates voiced alarm as they imagined what Mr. Trump might do next.""Nobody wants war, and that's what I am afraid of, is that there is going to be war,"" said Brenda Bachman, a 63-year-old from Marengo, Iowa, who had come to see Mr. Sanders. ""We don't need war.""Ross Mercer, 37, a disabled Navy veteran in New Hampshire who served two tours in Iraq, said at Mr. Buttigieg's event that he was worried about Iranian retaliation.""We attacked their country first and I'm scared that they're going to come back and attack our country,"" Mr. Mercer said.There is some precedent for events overseas reshaping American primary elections, often to the benefit of a candidate regarded as a figure of experience -- in this case, perhaps Mr. Biden. In December 2003, the capture of Saddam Hussein in Iraq formed a backdrop for the final phase of a Democratic presidential primary that yielded the quick nomination of John F. Kerry, a Vietnam veteran who served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.Four years later, in 2007, the troop surge in Afghanistan and the December assassination of a former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, in Pakistan pushed national security to the center of an unsettled Republican primary that ended with the nomination of John S. McCain, the war hero whose campaign focused overwhelmingly on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Kevin Madden, a political strategist who advised Mr. Bush and Mitt Romney's presidential campaigns, said national security tended to become an election issue in response to major external developments. He cited the Benghazi attack in the fall of 2012 and the Paris nightclub massacre in 2015 as other recent examples.""Every recent contest has had one of these events,"" Mr. Madden said, ""where everything seems to stop and cause all the participants, from the candidates and campaigns to the voters and the media, to recalibrate the stakes of the election through the lens of national security and foreign policy.""But an intensifying debate over foreign policy could have the effect of both spotlighting Mr. Biden's extensive track record in the Middle East and subjecting it to new scrutiny. There have been signs in recent days that several of the leading Democratic candidates were angling for a foreign policy debate with Mr. Biden, even before the outbreak of violence in Iraq and the Suleimani killing came to consume the news.Mr. Sanders has campaigned consistently on his antiwar record, and he has repeatedly highlighted Mr. Biden's past support for the Iraq war, warning Democrats that Mr. Trump would use that record against the former vice president in a general election. On Friday morning, an aide to Mr. Sanders posted images on Twitter showing the progressive lawmaker speaking out against war in Iraq in 1991, 1998, 2002 and 2014.Mr. Biden told reporters in Iowa on Friday that he would not respond to Mr. Sanders's criticism, calling it ""ridiculous"" and countering that Mr. Sanders had his own ""baggage."" He did not specify what he meant by that.Mr. Buttigieg, meanwhile, has attempted to counter questions about his own relative inexperience by pointing to Mr. Biden's stances on Iraq, as an example of how experience was not always an asset in campaigning or governing.""He supported the worst foreign policy decision made by the United States in my lifetime, which was the decision to invade Iraq,"" Mr. Buttigieg said in an Iowa television interview.Mr. Sanders's speech on Friday also indicated how he might use foreign policy to separate himself from other senators who are running for president: He pointed out that he has voted against all of Mr. Trump's military budgets, a distinction that Ms. Warren and Ms. Klobuchar cannot claim.It is impossible to predict precisely how an extended debate over foreign affairs might alter the dynamics of the Democratic race. On Friday, some voters said they yearned for a candidate with Biden-like credentials, while others said they wanted one with a Sanders-like aversion to war.""I don't think it would have escalated to this point if he was the current president,"" Craig Bruxvoort, a 62-year-old Iowa voter, said of Mr. Sanders.At Mr. Biden's event in Dubuque, Karen Sudmeier, a retired teacher, said she had begun the day considering several options -- including Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg -- but after hearing Mr. Biden speak about the Middle East she had decided to support him.""Joe knew everything about it,"" said Ms. Sudmeier, 72. ""He had a plan. And the consequences he laid out of what could happen, I thought, were frightening.""Reid J. Epstein contributed reporting from North Conway, N.H., Sydney Ember from Anamosa, Iowa, and Katie Glueck from Dubuque, Iowa.PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., far left, denounced President Trump's decision to approve a military strike in Iraq on Friday, describing Mr. Trump as ""dangerously incompetent.""

| Jump to first hitHours after an article described an unpublished manuscript by his former national security adviser, President Trump rejected John Bolton's account.WASHINGTON -- President Trump on Monday pushed back on a firsthand account from his former national security adviser, John R. Bolton, about tying military aid for a foreign ally to his own personal agenda, as senators consider the president's future in the Oval Office.""I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens,"" Mr. Trump wrote just after midnight, referring to a widely debunked theory that the president had pursued about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter.In an unpublished manuscript of his upcoming book, Mr. Bolton described the White House decision to withhold military aid from Ukraine until he left the White House in September. As national security adviser, Mr. Bolton would have been involved in many of the high-level discussions about Ukraine.Mr. Bolton's account directly undercuts one of Mr. Trump's defense arguments, that the frozen funding was not connected to his petitioning of Ukraine's leader, President Volodymyr Zelensky, to help him in the 2020 presidential election by announcing an anticorruption investigation into the Bidens.The new details come at a time when senators approach making a final decision -- possibly by the end of the week -- on whether to allow new evidence and new witnesses, like Mr. Bolton, to be introduced in Mr. Trump's trial in the Senate. Mr. Trump's defense team started presenting his defense on Saturday and has through Tuesday to argue against his removal from office.""There can be no doubt now that Mr. Bolton directly contradicts the heart of the president's defense,"" Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, said in a joint statement on Sunday after The New York Times's article about Mr. Bolton's account was published.Hours after his midnight posts, Mr. Trump falsely stated that the Democrats never asked Mr. Bolton to testify during the House impeachment inquiry last year. Republicans and Mr. Trump's defense team have argued that to call witnesses at this stage in the impeachment proceedings amounts to Democrats telling the Senate to do the work the House did not.Mr. Trump also falsely claimed that his White House released the critical military aid to Ukraine ahead of schedule.Democrats have been pushing the Republican-led Senate to allow new witnesses, including possibly Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, who played a key role in the Ukraine pressure campaign. There were few signs by the end of last week that any Republicans would vote with Democrats on the matter.But Mr. Bolton's account about Mr. Trump's motivations for freezing the military aid appeared to further sway at least two Republican senators -- Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- to consider hearing new testimony.""I think it's increasingly likely that other Republicans will join those of us who think we should hear from John Bolton,"" Mr. Romney told reporters on Monday.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and one of the president's biggest supporters in the Senate, said if Democrats call witnesses, Republicans should be able to as well. Republicans have been clamoring to hear from Mr. Biden and his son about their ties to Ukraine, which Mr. Trump has called corrupt.By Monday morning, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, and Mr. Graham had pressed the White House for an explanation of Mr. Bolton's account.Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Bolton's manuscript was provided to the National Security Council and edits to it had not been seen or made by anyone else in the White House.""That is something that we have kept walled off for obvious reasons,"" Ms. Grisham said Monday on Fox News. ""Just could be a conflict with the trail going on, so it's nothing that I've seen and nothing that I know about in terms of what they would remove for national security.""Fred Fleitz, Mr. Bolton's former chief of staff, called on him in an opinion piece for Fox News to immediately withdraw the book from the publisher.Mr. Bolton's lawyer blamed the White House for the disclosure of the book's contents, which Mr. Bolton submitted for a standard security review 12 days after the House impeached Mr. Trump. It is possible that the submission of Mr. Bolton's book to the White House deepened desires to keep Mr. Bolton from testifying.In his manuscript, Mr. Bolton describes an effort that he had made, along with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, to push Mr. Trump to release the aid. Mr. Bolton said he also spoke with Attorney General William P. Barr about his concerns over the parallel diplomacy with Ukraine led by the president's personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Barr, whom Mr. Trump mentioned in his July phone call with Mr. Zelensky, has tried to distance himself from Mr. Giuliani and the Ukraine matter.Bob Driscoll, a lawyer for Mr. Mulvaney, disputed Mr. Bolton's account and said Mr. Bolton was merely trying to sell his book, which is set to be released in mid-March.Mr. Bolton, who has said he would testify at the Senate trial if he was subpoenaed, wrote in the manuscript that Mr. Pompeo told him privately that there was no basis to criticize the American ambassador to Ukraine at the time, Marie L. Yovanovitch. Career diplomats have testified that there was no justification to fire Ms. Yovanovitch. Mr. Giuliani and two of his associates had been pushing Mr. Trump to fire her since the spring of 2018.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.PhotographPresident Trump at the White House on Friday.

| Jump to first hitThe president, in a series of tweets, said the U.S. would not restrict sales to the country, a sharp shift in administration policy.WASHINGTON -- President Trump publicly objected to efforts within his own administration to restrict the sales of American technology to China over national security concerns, insisting on Tuesday that such fears were an ""excuse"" and that the United States was open for business.Mr. Trump's comments appeared to represent a striking reversal of his administration's aspirations to curb China's ascent as a global leader in technology and came as cabinet officials were expected to discuss tougher restrictions on China later this month.That meeting, set for Feb. 28, was expected to include a discussion about whether to halt sales to China of an aircraft engine produced in part by General Electric by blocking its license to export the technology. Officials were also expected to consider new rules that would further curtail the ability of Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, to have access to American technology, including semiconductors.But on Tuesday, Mr. Trump seemed to scuttle such moves. Two people familiar with the matter said that the late February meeting was on hold and that the United States would not block G.E.'s ability to sell jet engine parts to China.""The United States cannot, & will not, become such a difficult place to deal with in terms of foreign countries buying our product, including for the always used National Security excuse, that our companies will be forced to leave in order to remain competitive,"" Mr. Trump wrote. ""We want to sell product and goods to China and other countries.""""As an example, I want China to buy our jet engines, the best in the World,"" he said in another tweet. ""I have seen some of the regulations being circulated, including those being contemplated by Congress, and they are ridiculous.""Speaking on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, Mr. Trump insisted that he cared deeply about America's national security but suggested that the term was being wielded too broadly and at the expense of the U.S. economy.""I think people were getting carried away with it,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I want our companies to be allowed to do business,"" he added, referring specifically to chip-makers, which have complained about lost sales to Huawei, a large buyer of American semiconductors. ""Things are put on my desk that have nothing to do with national security.""Mr. Trump said that he had been ""very tough on Huawei"" but that he wanted American companies ""to be able to sell all of this incredible technology.""The about-face is the latest blow to the China hawks in the Trump administration and another win for more moderate advisers like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has been pushing for greater accommodation of Beijing amid pressure from corporate America.The administration's efforts to restrict the flow of American technology to China has triggered objections from companies, who say it undermines their ability to compete on a global scale. Foreign firms have already taken steps to limit the American components in their products over concerns that access to parts they need could be cut off. And some American companies say they may begin to do more research and development outside the United States to avoid running afoul of the administration's stricter China rules.General Electric, in response to media reports on Saturday about the administration's review of its export license, said in a statement that it would comply with any requirements imposed by the United States but played down concerns about the risks of sales to China.""We aggressively protect and defend our intellectual property and work closely with the U.S. government to fulfill our responsibilities and shared security and economic interests,"" General Electric said in a statement. ""G.E. has provided products and services in the global marketplace for decades.""The potential U.S. restrictions have gotten China's attention.Geng Shuang, spokesman for China's foreign ministry, criticized the U.S. proposal to halt the jet engine deliveries during a news conference on Tuesday.""It would expose certain U.S. officials' ignorance in science and technology, disregard of the market principle, and anxiety with China's development,"" he said during a briefing. ""It will be another example of the U.S. using political means to undermine bilateral commercial cooperation and wantonly oppress China.""Mr. Trump's description of national security as an ""excuse"" for interfering in international commerce is surprising given the president's decision to routinely link economic and national security. Mr. Trump has cited the need to protect national security in his decision to impose tariffs on foreign metals and to consider placing them on foreign autos. The U.S. has also cited national security in expanding its ability to block international mergers and acquisitions.The shift in position is also notable given the administration's ongoing efforts to crack down on Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant that is on a government blacklist. Administration officials were expected to further restrict American sales to Huawei by closing a loophole that has allowed technology companies like Intel and Micron to continue shipping chips, software and other products to Huawei. While the Pentagon initially opposed the tighter rules, fearing it could hurt defense suppliers, it has now reversed its position under pressure from other administration officials.That reversal came amid tougher words toward China from top Trump administration officials, who in recent days have expressed growing concern about China's technology dominance.Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper assailed China for stealing technology and then developing its own systems to dominate critical sectors.""Huawei and 5G are today's poster child for this nefarious activity,"" Mr. Esper said.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took the criticism of China a step further at the conference, referring to Chinese state-backed technology companies as ""Trojan horses for Chinese intelligence.""It appeared that Mr. Trump shared that sentiment. Richard Grenell, the American ambassador to Germany, said on Twitter on Sunday that the president had just called him from Air Force One and asked him to make clear that ""any nation who chooses to use an untrustworthy 5G vendor will jeopardize our ability to share Intelligence and information at the highest level.""But Mr. Mnuchin -- a close confidante of Mr. Trump who has repeatedly warned against pursuing draconian measures that would stifle business and inhibit the United States economy during an election year -- appeared to have influenced the president's decision.The Treasury Department had no comment.Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who advises the Trump administration, said that Mr. Trump's comments reflected the president's focus on increasing trade, boosting jobs and making Americans wealthy.""The president has been clear about wanting American companies to get rich in China,"" Mr. Pillsbury said. ""President Trump frequently says he doesn't want China to surpass us but he never said he wants to put them out of business or be vindictive.""On Tuesday, business groups cheered the shift in tone, which came suddenly and took some by surprise.""We applaud President Trump's tweets supporting U.S. companies being able to sell products to China and opposing proposed regulations that would unduly curtail that ability,"" John Neuffer, president and chief executive of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said in a statement. ""As we have discussed with the administration, sales of nonsensitive, commercial products to China drive semiconductor research and innovation, which is critical to America's economic strength and national security.""Jacob Parker, senior vice president of the US-China Business Council, said that the administration was notorious for giving mixed messages on such policies and that he was hopeful that the White House would put out a formal notification that the tighter rules affecting companies that sell components to Huawei are off the table.""We hope that the message that this is undermining the ability of companies to invest in long-term research and development is beginning to resonate with those in the administration,"" Mr. Parker said.However, signs that Mr. Trump is softening his stance on China could draw backlash from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers who have been urging him to keep pressure on Beijing.""The Chinese Communist Party is engaged in a whole-of-state effort to supplant the United States and our critical industries by stealing intellectual property and through state-owned or state-directed enterprises,"" said Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida. ""The United States must ensure our current export controls are sufficient to prevent handing over sensitive technologies to Beijing.""Julian Barnes and David McCabe contributed reportingPhotographTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is among those who have been pushing to accommodate Beijing.Word count: 1398Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hitThe Democratic candidates are all debating a singular issue. New polls offer insights, not answers.Hi. Welcome to On Politics , your guide to the day in national politics. I'm Giovanni Russonello, your morning newsletter writer taking over your afternoon edition.Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.At Wednesday night's Democratic presidential debate, the candidates bickered and battled over health care policy; over Michael Bloomberg's record and his right to represent a party that he only recently rejoined; over the possible dangers of nominating a democratic socialist.But in a way, it all seemed like just window dressing around one big question: Who has the best chance in November? Every policy critique seemed to lead inexorably back to this issue of electability.In his very first comments at the debate, Mr. Bloomberg didn't just criticize Senator Bernie Sanders's plan to create a single-payer health care system -- he said it would cause Democrats to lose the general election.""I don't think there's any chance of the senator beating President Trump,"" Mr. Bloomberg said. ""You don't start out by saying I've got 160 million people, I'm going to take away the insurance plan that they love.""Mr. Sanders shot back, arguing that Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, was ""a billionaire saying that we should not raise the minimum wage or that we should cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.""""If that's a way to beat Donald Trump, wow, I would be very surprised,"" Mr. Sanders said.A wide majority of Democratic primary voters have said in poll after poll that they care about finding someone who can win the general election more than finding a candidate who agrees with them on the issues.But who is that candidate? It's far from clear.Until recently, Democratic voters tended to see former Vice President Joe Biden as the strongest option. But after he failed to place in the top three in either Iowa or New Hampshire, he lost any veneer of invincibility. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released Wednesday showed that for the first time in the race, Democrats are most likely to name Mr. Sanders as the candidate with the best chance to beat Mr. Trump.Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's approval rating has risen, most likely lifted by the strength of the economy and his acquittal in the Senate's impeachment trial. His Gallup approval rating hit 49 percent this month -- the highest number of his presidency. So while a majority of Americans still disapprove of him, he has the potential to win at least as much support as he did in 2016, when he lost the popular vote but pulled off a decisive win in the Electoral College.The ABC/Washington Post poll showed that in head-to-head matchups with all six of the candidates onstage at the debate, Mr. Trump would earn between 45 and 47 percent of the vote nationwide. The Democrats' shares varied from 49 to 52 percent. The differences between each Democrat were all within the poll's margin of error.This suggests that, despite Mr. Sanders's claim that a ""political revolution"" would be needed to drive turnout, and in spite of his more moderate rivals' argument that his left-wing proposals would alienate a huge swath of voters, any Democratic nominee would probably have a good chance of winning the popular vote.But Republicans have won the Electoral College three times this century, even though they have won the popular vote only once. So what really matters is who can beat Mr. Trump in a handful of key swing states.That's why Quinnipiac University asked voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- three states that Mr. Trump narrowly flipped in 2016, giving him an Electoral College win -- to choose between the president and each of the six leading Democratic candidates.The data from those polls suggests that Mr. Trump is in a very strong position to win Wisconsin, a heavily white state that was once solidly blue but has trended conservative over the past 10 years. None of the six leading Democratic candidates finished ahead of Mr. Trump there.Conversely, in Michigan and Pennsylvania, he didn't have a lead against any of them. Mr. Biden beat Mr. Trump by eight percentage points in Pennsylvania -- where he was born -- and by four points in Michigan. Mr. Sanders was up by five points against the president in Michigan, and by four points in Pennsylvania. Mr. Bloomberg led Mr. Trump by six points in Pennsylvania, and by five points in Michigan.The other three candidates included in the poll -- Senator Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Senator Elizabeth Warren -- generally fared a little less strongly, though Ms. Klobuchar had a strong, seven-point lead over Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania, and none of them were behind him there or in Michigan.A University of North Florida poll released this week found meaningful differences between the candidates' chances in that state. Mr. Bloomberg beat Mr. Trump by six points among registered Florida voters, thanks in part to the strength of his support among voters with college degrees, according to the poll. Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, both hobbled by relatively weak support from black and Latino voters, each finished four points behind the president.Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden both ran neck-and-neck with Mr. Trump.Like all surveys, head-to-head polls are not actually able to predict the future. They simply show what might happen if the election were held today. A lot will change over the course of the campaign.Still, what happens in these bellwether states will determine the election -- so you can expect these kinds of head-to-head polls to be more common as the primary season rambles on, and as Democrats continue to fret over their chances to take down Mr. Trump.Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We'll try to answer it. Have a comment? We're all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com .From Opinion: The trickiness of electabilityIn this new weekly feature, our colleagues from The New York Times's Opinion section will share expert analysis and perspectives from across the political spectrum. In today's installment, there's more to read about why electability is so unpredictable.There is a home base that all the conversation about the Democratic presidential primary comes back to in the end: Primary voters prioritize, above all, someone who can defeat President Trump.In any election that features an incumbent president, the main goal of the out-of-power party is to nominate a candidate well-suited to defeating the incumbent. That's why both Republican Party elites and less enthusiastic conservative voters got behind Mitt Romney after a series of polls in 2011 showed he was the only Republican beating President Barack Obama in head-to-head matchups.This year, Democrats' desire to replace the incumbent has reached a fever pitch, arguably higher than it's ever been for either party. But paradigm-shifting presidents have complicated the idea of electability, as Adam Jentleson, a former deputy chief of staff for Senator Harry Reid, pointed out this week in an Op-Ed.Mr. Obama won his first election despite being a ""black man who had admitted to using cocaine, who was caught on tape calling working-class whites 'bitter' people who 'cling to guns and religion,' and who sat in the pews with a pastor who declared, 'God damn America',"" Mr. Jentleson said.Mr. Romney, the Republicans' supposed safe bet, lost despite running against the sluggish economy under Mr. Obama.And Hillary Clinton, another supposed safe bet, lost to Donald J. Trump.So does anyone know what electability even means anymore? Our columnist Bret Stephens believes that ""of course Bernie can win,"" but also thinks that the current front-runner's democratic socialist vision may be disqualifying for many voters: ""For some of us, none-of-the-above is a viable option. For far too many others,"" he writes, Trump will ""be the devil they know.""-- Talmon Joseph SmithThanks for reading.

| Jump to first hitThe amount far exceeds what Congress allocated for border barriers this year as the president, with his eye on his re-election campaign, rushes to show major progress on a signature promise.President Trump plans to divert an additional $7.2 billion in military funding for the construction of a wall on the southern border, according to two people familiar with the plans, as officials rush to show major progress on his signature campaign promise in time for the 2020 election.The money would be stripped from Defense Department construction and counterdrug projects, the officials said, and amounts to even more than the billions the administration transferred from the Pentagon last year to pay for Mr. Trump's border wall.Congress allocated a fraction of that in December in the 2020 budget for border barrier construction -- just $1.375 billion. But there were also no limitations placed on Mr. Trump's ability to transfer funds from Pentagon accounts. The administration has now allocated more than $18 billion for Mr. Trump's border wall.The funding would allow the administration to complete more than 880 miles of border wall by 2022, the officials said. But Mr. Trump is still far behind on his promise to deliver 450 miles of wall by the end of this year. Just last Friday, the acting homeland security secretary celebrated the completion of 100 miles of border wall, much of it on land already owned by the federal government.""The wall system you see behind me is an undeniable impediment to smugglers, traffickers and other criminals who have exploited our lack of effective border infrastructure to smuggle drugs, illicit goods and engage in human trafficking,"" the acting secretary, Chad Wolf, said on Friday.Mr. Trump's pursuit of a border wall picked up momentum last Thursday when a federal appeals court allowed the administration to use $3.6 billion in military construction funds, a move that delayed or suspended 127 military projects. The ruling overturned a decision by an El Paso judge who had found that Mr. Trump's emergency proclamation, which allowed him to obtain the military funds, was unlawful.""Multiple courts have already ruled that President Trump has no authority to take billions from service members for his xenophobic wall,"" said Dror Ladin, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union's National Security Project. ""The A.C.L.U. won't rest until the president's illegal power grab is blocked once and for all.""The plans to transfer more funds from the Pentagon, first reported by The Washington Post, reaffirm that Mr. Trump is likely to again center his campaign on the border wall, a project that was initially used as a mnemonic device to remind him to focus on immigration at 2016 presidential campaign rallies.Mr. Trump faces other impediments for his construction, including an investigation into a $400 million contract for wall construction awarded to Fisher Sand & Gravel by the Office of Inspector General for the Defense Department. The company's chief executive, Tommy Fisher, has repeatedly pushed for the wall on Fox News, the president's favorite news channel, which has helped others win senior positions in the Department of Homeland Security.Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, has taken a lead role in Mr. Trump's presidential campaign and specifically the construction of the wall. Mr. Kushner has held meetings with military leaders to discuss moving money to Mr. Trump's border wall.But money is not the only obstacle: Even as the administration secures funding for the wall, the potential path of the project still runs through land the government does not own.Mr. Trump has encouraged officials to use eminent domain powers to seize land from private landowners. But many owners of land in the wall's path are fighting the federal government in court, a process that delayed previous administrations' efforts to construct border barriers for years.PhotographPresident Trump in September in Otay Mesa, Calif.

| Jump to first hitAs the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump nears, the Republican senator from Colorado has gone to ground as he tries to keep moderates and independents in his corner while facing a tough re-election race.DENVER -- They keep expecting to see Senator Cory Gardner everywhere -- on the local Fox affiliates in Colorado, on Facebook, on literature crammed inside their mailboxes. They are voters who wear tasteful crepe blouses and carry structured Kate Spade totes, who like how their 401(k)'s are performing but say they could do without President Trump's ""temperament.""They are members of one of the most coveted groups in electoral politics: suburban women. But in their field of vision, Mr. Gardner, Colorado's top Republican officeholder, is almost nowhere to be found.""I don't hear him speaking out on things,"" said Jennifer Gremmert, 50, the executive director of an energy nonprofit. She is the kind of voter who could help Mr. Gardner win re-election in November, a registered Democrat who considers herself ""nonpartisan,"" ""not that enthusiastic"" about her party's Senate candidates, and ""totally"" open to Mr. Gardner. But when it comes to the bipartisan stands that Ms. Gremmert said she prized in a candidate, ""I don't see him.""On one level, this is strange: Many of these voters were crucial to Mr. Gardner's narrow Senate victory in 2014, when he carried the suburban vote and was ahead among independents, according to exit polls. And they may be even more essential to him now -- he is widely considered to be one of the most at-risk G.O.P. senators seeking re-election this year.But Mr. Gardner's invisibility -- he hasn't held a town hall-style meeting in two years -- is also pragmatic, a means of avoiding questions about his ties to the divisive president, especially as the Senate impeachment trial nears. If Mr. Gardner ends up vocally supporting the president, or votes to acquit him in the trial, it will complicate and perhaps even endanger his race to hold onto his seat.Unlike most Republican senators, Mr. Gardner has been largely mum on the articles of impeachment against the president and the Senate trial starting Tuesday. Early in the process, he called the impeachment inquiry a ""total circus,"" but notably refused to answer questions about whether the president's conduct with Ukraine had been appropriate.Mr. Gardner hasn't indicated one way or the other whether he'd vote to subpoena witnesses in President Trump's impeachment trial, even as some other senators facing tough re-election fights, like Senator Susan Collins of Maine, have expressed an openness to doing so. Last week on Capitol Hill, he evaded reporters eager to pin down his thoughts, his handler hurrying him into the nearest elevator. On Thursday evening, when a local Colorado reporter caught him at the Denver airport, a smiling Mr. Gardner offered still no clarity. ""We have a trial,"" he said. ""That's where we're at right now.""While Ms. Collins and some other senators open to calling witnesses have been critical of the president at times, Mr. Gardner is far more circumspect about Mr. Trump, and relies heavily on Republicans and conservatives for votes -- people who are intensely loyal to the president.But if Mr. Gardner is going to win in 2020, in a state that votes Democratic in presidential elections, he is also going to need voters like the women who joined Ms. Gremmert for lunch on a recent Friday in Denver's Greenwood Village. They consider themselves moderate Republicans and likely to support Mr. Gardner, but want to hear him make a case for himself and his record.""I think his presence is being overshadowed by Donald Trump,"" lamented Sandra Hagen Solin, a 51-year-old Republican who runs her own lobbying firm. ""He needs to get his message out.""That message, many Republicans insist, is a strong one. Mr. Gardner's supporters often note how in the last four years, he has had more legislation signed into law than the rest of Colorado's congressional delegation combined. But such is the trade-off, perhaps, of Mr. Gardner's disappearing act: While it allows him to sidestep uncomfortable questions about the president, it also prevents him from aggressively promoting the record that Republican strategists believe he can win on.Dick Wadhams, a veteran Colorado Republican operative, was not bashful about calling out Mr. Gardner's fear of public exposure. ""If I had one criticism of him,"" Mr. Wadhams said, ""it's that his team keeps him locked up in a fortress."" (Mr. Gardner and his aides did not return multiple requests for comment.)Impeachment has served only to highlight Mr. Gardner's silence, whether on his own record or the national issues du jour, according to other Colorado Republicans. His caginess has frustrated some Trump supporters in Colorado, whose votes Mr. Gardner will almost certainly need to prevail in November, when Democrats are likely to come out in force in the presidential election.""I think he wants to please everybody, but he needs to be more transparent,"" Angela Carr, a 44-year-old flight attendant, said at the Denver Republican Party's recent monthly breakfast.Ms. Carr, who said she became a Republican ""because of Trump,"" recalled the October day that Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina introduced a resolution condemning the House impeachment inquiry. ""We're watching all the other Republican senators sign on it, and we're like, 'O.K., Cory ...""' she said. ""And he finally did toward the end, but you kind of want to see your guy or gal more out there.""She and others at the Denver breakfast acknowledged the political considerations that prevent Mr. Gardner from mirroring the approach of a Southern lawmaker like Mr. Graham on impeachment. In 2016, Mr. Trump lost Colorado to Hillary Clinton by just under five percentage points. In 2018, Democrats swept every statewide office in Colorado in what was largely seen as a rebuke to Mr. Trump's administration. And now, Mr. Gardner, according to Morning Consult, has an approval rating of just 36 percent.But many Republicans were quick to point out that Mr. Gardner is no stranger to long-shot races and the complicated political dynamics that come with them.In 2014, Mr. Gardner, then a congressman, challenged Senator Mark Udall in a race where ""Cory was seen as a dead man walking,"" according to Tyler Sandberg, a Colorado Republican operative. The reason: Just two years earlier, President Barack Obama had beaten Mitt Romney in the state by more than five points.But Mr. Gardner won his seat in 2014 by 2.5 percentage points, or about 50,000 votes, in a year when Republicans flipped nine Democratic-held seats nationwide and took control of the Senate. He was able to do so in large part, Mr. Sandberg said, ""because he refused to let himself be pigeonholed into something he wasn't.""In his campaign, Mr. Udall sought to characterize Mr. Gardner as an extreme social conservative, which Mr. Gardner -- in a steady stream of television ads, digital media and public appearances -- consistently pushed back on.It's an approach that Republican strategists believe would work well in this environment, too, as some Democrats try to portray him as too pro-Trump and some conservatives say he is not pro-Trump enough.""I'm confused as to why he's not out on the stump more, because that's what he was so good at in 2014,"" Mr. Sandberg said.In addition to not holding a town hall event since August 2017, Mr. Gardner has no upcoming events listed on his Facebook page. In an August 2019 editorial, The Greeley Tribune, which serves Mr. Gardner's former congressional district, criticized the senator for his dearth of public events. ""Gardner has been largely absent during the past five years when it comes to being available for his constituents, to whom he needs to be accountable,"" the editorial board wrote.And on impeachment, he has rankled even local talk radio hosts for dodging interviews. In late November, Steffan Tubbs, who hosts a Denver station owned by the conservative broadcast company Salem Media, told his viewers that Mr. Gardner's team had declined a request to interview the senator about ""the impeachment inquiry, campaign, and Thanksgiving plans."" Mr. Tubbs, who called Mr. Gardner ""a friend,"" criticized the senator for his ""crickets"" during ""a very critical time in this administration.""Some Republican voters sympathize with Mr. Gardner's predicament. In his last town hall event, which was his first in a year, Mr. Gardner was all but shouted offstage by liberal protesters as he tried to explain his efforts to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act.""I don't blame a senator or congressman for trying to find another way to engage that's actually productive and collaborative,"" said Debbie Brown, the president of the Colorado Business Roundtable, who considers herself a moderate Republican.But other observers think he missed an opportunity, if only to make a point about liberals like those who shouted him down. ""I thought Cory should have held one town hall after another right away, then stopped them on the grounds the left was so asinine,"" said Lynn Bartels, a former longtime political reporter in Colorado.Mr. Gardner's supporters are optimistic that once voters hear the extent of his record ""separate from Trump,"" as Ms. Solin put it, his stance on the president will matter less. His supporters point to his yearslong effort to relocate the Bureau of Land Management from Washington, D.C., to Colorado, which the administration has announced as officially underway. They also promote his work with Democrats including Senator Elizabeth Warren to allow cannabis businesses access to the banking industry in states like Colorado, where marijuana is legal.Mr. Gardner is likely to end up facing John Hickenlooper, the former Democratic governor now running for Senate, in the general election, and he will probably maintain many Republican votes -- even if cast grudgingly.At the recent Denver G.O.P. breakfast, where some people wore ""Make America Great Again"" and ""Keep America Great"" hats, but where Mr. Gardner's campaign was limited to a leaflet, Herb Glasser, a 54-year-old public accountant, said he planned to support Mr. Gardner despite resigning himself to being ""unhappy"" with the senator a long time ago.""We have no choice,"" said Mr. Glasser, who described himself as a ""true conservative.""According to Mr. Sandberg, the G.O.P. operative, it's now up to Mr. Gardner's campaign to reach those Coloradans who, despite their disdain for the president, might still be persuaded to give his party a chance.Voters, perhaps, like Amy Conklin. Ms. Conklin, a former Littleton City Council member, is a registered Democrat, but says she has long ""put out yard signs for both sides."" She was a legislative aide when Mr. Gardner was a member of the state House, and remembers him as ""a really good legislator,"" someone who ""would reach across the aisle.""Her feelings since have changed. ""I've been intensely disappointed in his behavior since he's gone to Washington,"" she said.Ms. Conklin conceded that Mr. Gardner had done some good work in the Senate. But what looms largest in her mind, what she says she'd be hardest pressed to forget, are a handful of photographs she's seen of Mr. Gardner, including one from last winter, in which she described him as ""smiling and waving, following Trump out of Air Force One.""PhotographCory Gardner of Colorado is widely considered to be one of the most at-risk Republican senators seeking re-election this year.

| Jump to first hitThe president injected new instability into his looming impeachment trial as Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned that nothing could ""erase"" the stain on his presidency.WASHINGTON -- President Trump on Sunday injected fresh instability into final preparations for the Senate's impeachment trial, suggesting that senators should dismiss the House's charges of high crimes and misdemeanors against him outright rather than dignifying them with a full tribunal.That unexpected statement, arriving amid a flurry of tweets, not only appeared to put the president at odds with Republican Senate leaders moving toward a full trial but also contradicted Mr. Trump's own words from just hours earlier, when he argued for a trial that would include as witnesses Democratic House leaders who are prosecuting him.""Many believe that by the Senate giving credence to a trial based on the no evidence, no crime, read the transcripts, 'no pressure' Impeachment Hoax, rather than an outright dismissal, it gives the partisan Democrat Witch Hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday afternoon. ""I agree!""It was the latest instance of the president publicly vacillating between his apparent desire to make the charges disappear and to precipitate an extended spectacle in the Senate that would turn the tables and put his critics on trial. Hours before, Speaker Nancy Pelosi had warned that anything short of a full trial with new witnesses and evidence would abet Mr. Trump's attempts to cover up wrongdoing.As the subject of the charges on trial, Mr. Trump has no direct say over how the Senate proceeds and, by all accounts, Republicans do not have the votes needed to dismiss the case as Mr. Trump suggested, at least not before hearing opening arguments.But the remarks could put lawmakers from his party in a difficult position in the weeks ahead if they have to justify to constituents loyal to the president why they are even giving a hearing to a case he derides as a ""sham.""And the zigzagging underscored the challenge facing Mr. Trump's defense team and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, as they try to navigate competing interests just days before the trial is to begin. Mr. McConnell has said he intends to run a trial similar to the 1999 impeachment proceeding against President Bill Clinton, meaning both House prosecutors and Mr. Trump's defense team will be given a chance to present their arguments.Mr. Trump's running impeachment commentary came on a day when much of Washington was busy preparing for the trial, only the third such proceeding in American history. Ms. Pelosi has said the House will send the two articles of impeachment charging Mr. Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress sometime this week, with a trial commencing as soon as Wednesday.Appearing Sunday on ABC's ""This Week"" before Mr. Trump's tweet, Ms. Pelosi told senators considering forgoing a full trial that ""dismissing is a cover-up"" and asserted that whatever the outcome, the trial could never ""erase"" the stain of impeachment from Mr. Trump's record.Even as the speaker expressed optimism that the House's three-month impeachment inquiry had collected enough evidence to win a conviction on its two charges, she implicitly acknowledged the difficulty Democrats would have in doing so. And she warned that the Senate proceeding might be little more than a cover-up if Republican senators did not agree to summon new witnesses and documents that Mr. Trump blocked from the House.""We have confidence in our case that it's impeachable, and this president is impeached for life, regardless of any gamesmanship on the part of Mitch McConnell,"" the speaker said, referring to Mr. McConnell.The House impeached Mr. Trump last month on two counts related to what Democrats concluded was a campaign by the president to pressure Ukraine to investigate his domestic political rivals, including by withholding as leverage a White House meeting and nearly $400 million in vital military aid from the country.""There's nothing,"" Ms. Pelosi said, ""the Senate can do that can ever erase that.""The comments appeared to be an acknowledgment that given the highly polarized state of the nation and the Senate, there was little chance that the two-thirds of senators needed for conviction and removal would agree to do so. They also foreshadowed a likely election-year strategy by Democrats, who are prepared to argue that voters should serve as an appeals court on Mr. Trump's fitness for office.""They take an oath to have a fair trial, and we think that would be with witnesses and documentation,"" Ms. Pelosi said. ""Now the ball is in their court to either do that, or pay a price for not doing it.""Before he called for a dismissal of the case, Mr. Trump appeared to be piqued by Ms. Pelosi. He suggested on Twitter questions for Ms. Pelosi to answer on air and later responded to her statements about his legacy.""Why should I have the stigma of Impeachment attached to my name when I did NOTHING wrong?"" he asked in one tweet, after her appearance, adding, ""Very unfair to tens of millions of voters!""In other posts, Mr. Trump repeated familiar attacks on the speaker and Representative Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat and House Intelligence Committee chairman who oversaw the impeachment inquiry and is likely to lead the prosecution in the Senate. Both Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schiff, he said, ought to be witnesses during the impeachment trial, a common argument among Republicans who believe the two lawmakers have mishandled their duties in their conduct of the impeachment inquiry.Congressional Republicans close to Mr. Trump also pounced on the speaker's prediction, arguing that it betrayed the Democrats' true motivation throughout the impeachment process: to build a case, any case, to slime Mr. Trump's re-election campaign before the November election.""Remember this, next time they try to pretend they were 'prayerfully' or 'reluctantly' impeaching @realDonaldTrump. They weren't,"" Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina, wrote on Twitter. ""It was all about trying to politically damage the President.""Ms. Pelosi unexpectedly withheld the articles in a bid to increase pressure on Republican senators to commit to calling witnesses, without whom Democrats privately concede they have no shot of even coming close to a conviction. Though she relented without winning any commitments from Republicans, the speaker argued on Sunday that she had succeeded in showing the public ""the need for witnesses.""Republican senators have already challenged the speed and exhaustiveness of the House's inquiry, and questions about the strength of the evidence it gathered and witnesses it did not secure are likely to be front and center as the trial gets underway.Under the rules Mr. McConnell intends to adopt, senators will eventually be able to vote on whether to call witnesses or other evidence, but there is no guarantee they will do so. Mr. McConnell has made clear that he wants a narrow and speedy trial, and that he does not foresee any chance of a conviction.It would take only four Republican senators to break ranks and join Democrats to secure the majority needed to compel the new testimony -- though even that may not be a guarantee.""I don't expect anything, but I don't think it's impossible,"" said Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination to take on Mr. Trump this fall, when asked about possible Republican defections.The most animated witness fight may be over John R. Bolton, the former White House national security adviser who said last week that he would be willing to testify in the trial if called by the Senate and even if the White House ordered him not to. Other impeachment witnesses and people close to him say that Mr. Bolton was deeply alarmed by Mr. Trump's actions toward Ukraine and, as one of his top aides, has relevant, firsthand information to share with lawmakers.Ms. Pelosi said on Sunday that she had not ""excluded"" the possibility that the House could subpoena Ms. Bolton to testify, but indicated that it was the Senate's responsibility for now. Mr. Schiff agreed, saying that there was ""little sense"" in bringing Mr. Bolton into the House now.PhotographPresident Trump, with Vice President Mike Pence, on Sunday issued contradicting tweets about impeachment charges against him.

| Jump to first hitThe escalation of a Senate inquiry into Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s son has coincided with the former vice president's overwhelming electoral turnaround.WASHINGTON -- Republicans are wielding the power of their Senate majority to intensify an election-year investigation of Hunter Biden's work for a Ukrainian energy firm, putting new scrutiny on the son of Joseph R. Biden Jr. as the former vice president re-emerges as President Trump's chief rival for the presidency.In elevating questions about the younger Mr. Biden's work in Ukraine, Senate Republicans are effectively picking up where the president left off last year when he pressed the country's leaders to investigate the Bidens, an effort that led to his impeachment in the House on charges that he abused his power by seeking foreign help in the 2020 election. It is part of a broader attempt by his allies on Capitol Hill to breathe fresh life into politically charged inquiries into issues that have preoccupied Mr. Trump.Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin and the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, plans to hold a vote next week despite Democratic objections to issue a rare Senate subpoena to Andrii Telizhenko, a former Ukrainian official who worked for Burisma, the energy firm. Mr. Johnson told reporters on Wednesday that he would release an interim report this spring summarizing what Republicans had learned from months of quiet queries.For now, Republicans insist Burisma is a matter of longstanding interest unrelated to Mr. Biden's presidential candidacy, and no evidence has emerged to suggest that either Biden acted improperly. But Mr. Johnson acknowledged that his investigation could affect the election and said that was as it should be.""These are questions that Joe Biden has never adequately answered,"" Mr. Johnson told reporters in the Capitol, a day after Mr. Biden's remarkable Super Tuesday turnabout. ""And if I were a Democrat primary voter, I'd want these questions satisfactorily answered before I cast my final vote.""The increased interest in the Bidens comes as Senate Republicans have ramped up other investigations that could benefit Mr. Trump politically, including an inquiry into the F.B.I.'s Russia investigation and claims that Democrats colluded with Ukraine in the 2016 election.Mr. Biden's campaign has branded the Johnson investigation an abuse of congressional authority and maintained that it would find no evidence of wrongdoing by the former vice president or his family. But Democrats are concerned that Republicans are trying to recreate their playbook for the run-up to the 2016 election, when Mr. Trump -- aided by Republicans and Fox News -- worked to weaponize a steady stream of small disclosures from an investigation into Hillary Clinton to cast her as secretive and potentially corrupt.Some Republicans have privately voiced discomfort about the effort. On Thursday, Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah and a member of the Homeland Security Committee, told reporters that there was ""no question"" that ""looking into Burisma and Hunter appears political."" He said he was not yet sure if he would support the subpoena.Mr. Romney was the only member of his party who voted at the Senate impeachment trial to convict Mr. Trump of abuse of power and remove him from office.""People are tired of these kind of political investigations, and would hope that if there is something of significance that needs to be evaluated, it would be done by perhaps the F.B.I. and some other agency that is not as political as a committee of our body,"" he said.But Mr. Trump has embraced the effort, using his megaphone to try to create a shroud of innuendo and doubt about an increasingly viable opponent. On Wednesday, he circulated on Twitter a report about Mr. Johnson's investigation and later told Sean Hannity of Fox News that portraying the Bidens as corrupt would be a central theme of his bid for re-election.""That will be a major issue in the campaign,"" Mr. Trump said in the interview. ""I will bring that up all the time.""At issue is Hunter Biden's position on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian oil and gas company with a history of corruption, which he held while his father served as vice president overseeing United States policy toward the former Soviet republic. The younger Mr. Biden had no expertise on energy issues and was paid a large salary. Mr. Trump and Republicans have continually raised questions about the arrangement, claiming with no evidence that it was part of a corrupt scheme.Mr. Johnson and Senate Republicans are specifically investigating whether Burisma used Hunter Biden's name and influence to gain access to the Obama administration.The investigation closely resembles the one that Mr. Trump pressed Ukraine to undertake last year into whether Mr. Biden sought to remove a Ukrainian prosecutor for investigating Burisma. That allegation has been discredited -- the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was widely viewed as corrupt, and his removal was supported by many American and European officials. (Mr. Johnson was among the Republican and Democratic senators who signed a letter at the time calling for ""urgent reforms"" to his office.)But Republicans mounting an impeachment defense for the president in the Senate later said Mr. Trump had been justified in wanting Ukraine to scrutinize the episode, insisting that the president had been asking for a legitimate investigation of possible corruption, not a political favor to smear a rival.Now, Republican senators argue that Mr. Biden's son is fair game.""I am not saying Joe Biden is corrupt -- far from it,"" said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. ""But he had knowledge that his son was sitting on the most corrupt board in the Ukraine, when he was trying to clean up the Ukraine. We are going to hold him accountable for that.""Democrats say Senate Republicans are knowingly raising a false flag for an operation designed to legitimize claims by Mr. Trump and some in the conservative news media.""What is actually new here?"" said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, one of the Democrats trying to counter the inquiry. ""There is no evidence to date that has implicated Vice President Biden in wrongdoing of any kind, and we base that on our review of hundreds of documents.""Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr. Biden's campaign, accused Mr. Johnson of ""abusing congressional authority in a manner that would make the founding fathers spin in their graves.""""We already knew that Donald Trump is terrified of facing Joe Biden -- because he got himself impeached by trying to force a foreign country to spread lies about the vice president on behalf of his re-election campaign,"" Mr. Bates said. ""Now, Senator Johnson just flat-out conceded that this is a ham-handed effort to manipulate Democratic primary voters.""Those leading the inquiries insist their focus on Burisma is not politically driven, noting that it dates to 2017, before it was clear that Mr. Biden would be a presidential candidate.""We are proceeding with the investigation whether Biden is in or out,"" said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Finance Committee, who co-signed numerous requests with Mr. Johnson. ""This investigation is about conflicts of interest, not political candidates.""In addition to the Burisma matter, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Grassley are investigating whether Democrats conspired with Ukrainian officials to harm Mr. Trump's campaign in 2016. Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, has previously warned his fellow chairmen in private that any investigation that turned on information from Ukraine should be handled delicately because it could advance Russian efforts to spread disinformation, according to two officials familiar with the discussions, which were first reported by Politico. (Mr. Burr said this week that he had no objection to Mr. Johnson's investigation.)It is unclear how far the Burisma investigation has advanced. The senators indicated they had received documents from multiple individuals in recent weeks, and the State Department has handed over 2,800 pages of records.Mr. Johnson sought approval for the subpoena from Senator Gary Peters of Michigan, the top Democrat in the Homeland Security Committee, but Mr. Peters refused, citing concerns similar to Mr. Burr's.In a letter to committee members on Sunday informing them of the subpoena vote next week, Mr. Johnson stressed that his staff was going to ""great lengths"" to consult with intelligence and law enforcement officials first.""I share the ranking member's interest in ensuring that the Senate and this committee not be used to advance disinformation,"" he wrote in the letter, which came the day after Mr. Biden won the South Carolina primary.PhotographJoseph R. Biden Jr. in Los Angeles on Wednesday. His campaign has branded an inquiry by Senator Ron Johnson, left, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, into Hunter Biden's ties to a Ukrainian energy company an abuse of congressional authority.

| Jump to first hitThe majority leader -- who has proved adept at the hand-to-hand procedural combat of the Senate, frustrating Democrats at every turn -- had been preparing for a trial for nearly a year.WASHINGTON -- On a Tuesday afternoon a week into President Trump's impeachment trial, Senator Mitch McConnell could see his carefully laid plan to deliver a swift acquittal veering off the rails.An explosive report detailing how John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, had confirmed a central allegation against Mr. Trump had roiled the Capitol and upended his push to block new witnesses, and if Mr. McConnell did not corral restive Republicans into submission, the trial could be blown wide open.""We can be smart or we can be stupid,"" Mr. McConnell warned his rank and file during a closed-door lunch of halibut, fried chicken and pecan pie in the Capitol, steps from the Senate floor where the trial was to convene shortly. ""The choice will be up to us.""Republicans ultimately opted, as they almost invariably do, to stick with Mr. McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and block Democrats' attempts to allow new evidence to be considered. All but one of them voted on Wednesday to acquit Mr. Trump of both of the charges against him.The story of how Mr. McConnell held Republicans together -- even in the face of stunning revelations about the president's conduct and uneasiness in his party about Mr. Trump's actions -- reflects how a master Senate tactician deployed his command of procedure and keen political instincts to lock down a process that posed an existential threat to the president. In doing so, he may have cemented the president's hold on his office and provided a defiant campaign message to propel him to re-election, uniting the party around a figure who brooks no dissent and dealing a death blow to Democrats' hopes of removing him.""If this was all about politics, and it was, at least at the moment I think it is fair to conclude that we won and they lost,"" Mr. McConnell said in an interview on Thursday in his Capitol office, before he headed to the White House, where he was effusively thanked by the president and received a standing ovation in the East Room.A Year of PreparationDemocrats contend that the victory is hollow, and that they won something as well, showing the public that Senate Republicans -- including several who are facing re-election this year in politically competitive states -- were unwilling to challenge Mr. Trump on either his behavior or his blithe dismissal of Congress's right to oversee the executive branch.""What we feel is we created Pyrrhic victory for them,"" Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said in an interview. ""This trial is regarded by most Americans as not a real trial, a sham. The acquittal has virtually no value because American know it wasn't fair.""But it evidently has great value to the president and to Mr. McConnell, who had spent nearly a year preparing for it. From the instant that Democrats assumed power in the House last January, denying that they had any intention of impeaching Mr. Trump, Mr. McConnell, a six-term Kentuckian and the longest-serving Senate Republican leader, directed his staff to quietly dig into the history of impeachments and consult with outside experts.""We thought they would finally work themselves up to doing this on something,"" Mr. McConnell said. ""It has been threatened endlessly. We needed to come up to speed on what actually happens, and that began in earnest last fall.""So when Mr. McConnell fielded a phone call from Mr. Trump days before Christmas, he was ready. Stung by the House vote to impeach him on two charges, the president reached out to the majority leader from his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Palm Beach, Fla., throwing out ideas about how to handle his coming Senate trial.Mr. McConnell had a reassuring response for the third president ever to face removal by the Senate, urging Mr. Trump to trust him to manage the confrontation.""What I have consistently said to him is I think I know more about the Senate than you do, which he usually concedes,"" Mr. McConnell recalled, saying he told the president to keep public commentary about impeachment to a minimum. ""My consistent advice to him with regard to this subject was to avoid it -- and for the most part, for the most part, he did.""Throughout the process, Mr. McConnell consistently refused to say how he viewed the president's conduct, even as other Republicans eventually said that Mr. Trump's actions were wrong, inappropriate and even shameful.""I say things I choose to say,"" he said when pressed Thursday.Yet that reticence did not dampen Mr. McConnell's zeal for beating back the impeachment push. Interviews with more than two dozen senators and top aides reflected how the impeachment fight that came to a close on Wednesday was never about whether Mr. Trump would be the first president to be removed from office -- both sides knew he would not. It was instead about how Republicans and Democrats would arrive at the inevitable outcome, and how much damage they would inflict on one another, the president and the Senate in the process.Mr. McConnell set out to create the framework for a trial that his members could get behind, that could withstand the possibility of compromising new information emerging and that would deliver the White House a quick but credible verdict of ""not guilty."" It went far from perfectly for Republicans -- among other setbacks, Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, voted ""guilty"" on the charge of abuse of power, depriving Mr. Trump of the absolute party loyalty he coveted -- but Mr. McConnell reached his desired end.""He is very good at what he does,"" said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas and a close ally of Mr. McConnell.By October, Mr. McConnell recognized that a trial was a near certainty. An anonymous White House whistle-blower had accused Mr. Trump of trying to cheat in the 2020 election by seeking to condition crucial military aid to Ukraine on the country announcing investigations into his political rivals, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden. The Democratic-led House was plunging ahead over solid Republican opposition.Mr. McConnell tasked Andrew Ferguson, his chief counsel, with mapping out a full trial strategy. He spoke with Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, counseling him that the White House needed to take the impeachment process seriously and study how President Bill Clinton's White House built a legal and communications defense team in 1998.Then he began to educate his colleagues, delivering a PowerPoint presentation to his members on what an impeachment trial would look like, introducing senators with a self-conscious matter-of-factness to what he called the ""Clinton model."" He and his advisers quickly determined that the question of calling witnesses would be the focal point of the trial fight and they seized on the ground rules governing Mr. Clinton's 1999 trial. In that proceeding, the modern precedent, the debate over witnesses came only after the House and the White House made opening arguments and senators posed written questions.That approach would help address a problem Mr. McConnell saw coming: likely demands by Democrats to include new testimony in the trial. In November, Mr. McConnell began sharing with Republicans his fear that votes to allow witnesses could create messy interparty disputes with the White House that would prolong the trial for weeks or more, without changing the outcome.He warned his fellow Republicans that Democrats would use the trial to force senators in tough re-election fights to take difficult votes as part of their drive to recapture the Senate.And Senate Democrats, led by Mr. Schumer were plotting just such a strategy. With no hope of reaching a two-thirds threshold for removing a president from office, they had no illusions about ousting Mr. Trump.The 'Legal Eagles'But Democrats wanted to make Republicans -- especially those facing voters in November -- cringe in defending the conduct of the president and force them to go on the record absolving Mr. Trump despite compelling evidence from the House that he had abused his power and sought to hide his actions from Congress.As the Thanksgiving recess approached, Mr. McConnell deputized a group of the senators who were lawyers to help him sell the plan. The ""Legal Eagles,"" as the group was informally called, included Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, Ted Cruz of Texas, and John Cornyn of Texas and their role was to educate their colleagues in constitutional law. Mr. Cruz eventually set up a war room for the trial in a rented space off Capitol Hill, staffed by members of his congressional office and political organization.Mr. Schumer had his gaze down the road as well. In November and again in December, Mr. Schumer summoned to his office a dozen moderate Democrats known to have relationships with Republicans to make a request: They should feel out their Republican counterparts in the chamber on the Ukraine matter and the looming trial, and report back. The overtures went nowhere. There would not be another of the famous bipartisan Senate ""gangs"" to try to find a compromise outcome.One more twist would come before lawmakers departed for Christmas. After the House impeachment vote, Ms. Pelosi announced that she would delay sending the articles needed to formally spur the Senate trial until she was assured that Mr. McConnell would conduct a fair one. Democrats now say they were also worried that Mr. McConnell might use the holiday recess crunch to seek a quick dismissal of the accusations.He was not planning to do so, but also did not intend to relinquish his grip on the proceedings or bend to Ms. Pelosi. When he spoke with Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, on a call to celebrate the passage of a bipartisan omnibus spending bill, he offered a quiet warning.""I've been in politics long enough to know you should never say never, but let me say this,"" Mr. McConnell told Mr. Hoyer. ""I will never allow the House of Representatives to dictate rules to the Senate. Never.""Behind the scenes, Mr. McConnell was trying to nail down the backing of the handful of Republicans who could complicate his careful planning. Four senators had expressed enough qualms about the president to give them leverage to win concessions from Mr. McConnell: Mr. Romney of Utah, the 2012 presidential nominee; Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who had in the past bucked Mr. McConnell and the White House; Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a veteran politician with plans to retire, and Susan Collins of Maine, a centrist facing the re-election challenge of her career.In two early January meetings in Mr. McConnell's office, with Mr. Alexander participating by conference call, the four negotiated a guarantee that the Senate would vote on whether to allow witnesses as it had been done in the Clinton trial.When Mr. McConnell unveiled his proposed resolution on the eve of the trial, it immediately provoked an uproar. The language guaranteeing a vote on witnesses was there, but so was a provision limiting to two days the 24 hours the House prosecutors and the president's defense team had for their oral arguments. And the rules said the record of the House impeachment inquiry would not be admitted unless the Senate voted to do so later.In a private lunch before the trial was to open, Senate Republicans rebelled, saying that the two-day limit was too abbreviated and that the House record had to be admitted to provide the basic evidence in the proceeding. Mr. McConnell and his team quickly backtracked, scrawling last-minute changes in the margins of the resolution moments before the debate began. Senate Republicans adopted it on a party-line vote, after rejecting Democratic attempts to subpoena Mr. Bolton and other witnesses, beginning the trial on a contentious and partisan note.From the outset, the pace was grinding, with senators unaccustomed to the long hours confined to the chamber. The grueling schedule was no accident. Mr. McConnell had instructed his staff to make it punishing, to exhaust senators and fuel their eagerness to bring it to a quick end.But as the trial progressed, it remained uncertain whether enough Republicans would break with the party to force the Senate to call witnesses. Mr. McConnell and his lieutenants were increasingly confident that the prosecution's arguments -- often repetitive -- were not taking hold and that Republicans were eager to move on.Then on Jan. 26, The New York Times reported that Mr. Bolton's firsthand account directly undercut the president's defense, rattling Republicans and complicating Mr. McConnell's plans.At the luncheon, Mr. McConnell led his anxious colleagues through a litany of sharp questions about what could go wrong if Republicans buckled and called Mr. Bolton. He kept up the pressure after the trial adjourned later that afternoon, gathering Republicans again, this time in a smaller room with just one door to limit comings and goings. Brandishing a card bearing a whip count, he made it clear that Republicans still lacked the votes to defeat witnesses, an unmistakable message that it was time for them to fall into line.""I thought they needed to hear it,"" he said in the interview. ""There were no free passes.""As he worked to round up votes to block witnesses, Mr. McConnell told wavering Republicans that they were being used as pawns in a Democratic scheme to undermine the courts by embarrassing Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who was presiding over the trial.Managing 'Quid Pro Quo'When Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat running for president, asked whether a chief justice overseeing a trial without witnesses would undermine the courts, Mr. McConnell scrawled a quick note to Ms. Murkowski, who was still undecided on witnesses, to point out the attack.With his eye on the undecided senators, Mr. Cruz also counseled the White House legal team to avoid arguing that there was no quid pro quo -- ""a strategic mistake"" that might make Mr. Bolton's testimony seem more relevant to those lawmakers. During questioning, Mr. Cruz helped draft a question, submitted jointly with senators like Ms. Murkowski and Mr. Alexander, that asked Mr. Trump's legal team whether, if Mr. Bolton testified to the existence of a quid pro quo, it would amount to an impeachable offense.When Patrick Philbin, a deputy White House counsel, rose to answer, asserting that Mr. Trump had never engaged in a quid pro quo, Mr. Cruz was ""a little white-knuckled,"" he recalled. But then the answer he was looking for came: Even if there was a quid pro quo, it did not matter.""I think that answer played a really important part in helping get the votes of both Lamar and Lisa,"" Mr. Cruz said later.By the next day, Ms. Murkowski had come out against witnesses, using as a rationale what she characterized as an attack on Chief Justice Roberts. She followed Mr. Alexander, who said that while Mr. Trump had acted inappropriately, his actions did not merit impeachment. The final vote on witnesses was 51 to 49 and the trial hurtled to its finale, with Mr. Romney's vote to convict the president as the final twist.Mr. McConnell shrugged off fierce criticism that he had overseen a sham.""I didn't rig anything,"" he said. ""We had a vote. No vote was prevented. No debate was prevented. These guys didn't have the votes,"" he said of Senate Democrats.""These guys would win more often if they win more elections,"" he said, ""and they have the opportunity to do that this year.""PhotographFrom top, Senator Mitch McConnell directed his staff to prepare for impeachment the instant Democrats assumed power in the House. ""We needed to come up to speed on what actually happens,"" he said. In the end, Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, saw a hollow victory for Republicans. Along the way, Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced a twist, delaying the sending of the articles to the Senate as she pressed for assurance a trial would be fair. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY T.J.

| Jump to first hitThe new acting director of national intelligence also asked to see the facts underlying the finding that Russia is interfering in the 2020 election and favors President Trump's re-election.WASHINGTON -- Richard Grenell's tenure as the nation's top intelligence official may be short-lived, but he wasted no time this week starting to shape his team of advisers, ousting his office's No. 2 official -- a longtime intelligence officer -- and bringing in an expert on Trump conspiracy theories to help lead the agency, according to officials.Mr. Grenell has also requested the intelligence behind the classified briefing last week before the House Intelligence Committee where officials told lawmakers that Russia was interfering in November's presidential election and that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia favored President Trump's re-election. The briefing later prompted Mr. Trump's anger as he complained that Democrats would use it against him.Joseph Maguire, the former acting director of national intelligence, and his deputy, Andrew P. Hallman, resigned on Friday. Mr. Grenell told Mr. Hallman, popular in the office's Liberty Crossing headquarters, that his service was no longer needed, according to two officials. Mr. Hallman, who has worked in the office or at the C.I.A. for three decades, expressed confidence in his colleagues in a statement but also referred to the ""uncertainties that come with change.""The ouster of Mr. Hallman and exit of Mr. Maguire, who also oversaw the National Counterterrorism Center, allowed Mr. Grenell to install his own leadership team.One of his first hires was Kashyap Patel, a senior National Security Council staff member and former key aide to Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Mr. Patel will have a mandate to ""clean house,"" CBS News reported, citing a person close to the matter.Mr. Patel was best known as the lead author of a politically charged memo two years ago that accused F.B.I. and Justice Department leaders of abusing their surveillance powers to spy on a former Trump campaign adviser. The memo was widely criticized as misleading, though an inspector general later found other problems with aspects of the surveillance.Working with Mr. Nunes, Mr. Patel began what they called Objective Medusa to examine the F.B.I.'s investigation into whether anyone associated with the Trump campaign conspired with Russia's election interference in 2016.""I hired him to bust doors down,"" Mr. Nunes told the author Lee Smith for his book ""The Plot Against the President,"" which chronicles Mr. Patel's investigations on behalf of the Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. Mr. Patel was interviewed extensively in the book, which claims without proof that journalists, diplomats, law enforcement and intelligence officials engaged in a vast plot to undermine Mr. Trump's campaign and then bring him down as president.As acting director of national intelligence, Mr. Grenell has access to any secrets he may want to review. And he has requested access to information from the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies, according to two people familiar with the matter.The revelations about last week's briefing reignited fears about Russia's continuing efforts to interfere in the American election, including in the Democratic primary races.During the briefing, which was supposed to focus on coordination between government agencies to fight election interference, not the acts themselves, Republicans challenged the intelligence agencies' conclusion that the Russians continue to favor Mr. Trump. Some officials said the briefing was not meant to be controversial and that intelligence officials intended to simply reiterate what they had told the Senate Intelligence Committee weeks earlier.Intelligence officials have already documented instances of the Kremlin trying to influence American politics, namely attempts by Russian military intelligence officers to hack into the Ukrainian energy company that once employed the son of former Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. Officials want to know whether the breach was an effort to help Mr. Trump, whose efforts to persuade Ukraine to announce investigations into Mr. Biden helped prompt his impeachment.And during the congressional impeachment hearings, Fiona Hill, a former senior White House official who worked on Russia issues, warned about Moscow's continued efforts to spread disinformation.Mr. Trump himself wrote in a January letter accompanying the administration's national counterintelligence strategy that ""Russia remains a significant intelligence threat to United States interests -- employing aggressive acts to instigate and exacerbate tensions and instability in the United States, including interfering with the security of our elections.""Intelligence officials were scheduled to brief the full House and Senate on election security on March 10, arrangements that were made weeks ago, accounting to congressional aides.How long Mr. Grenell will be able to stay as the acting director is an open question. For him to remain past March 11 -- a limit imposed by federal law -- Mr. Trump must formally nominate someone else for the director of national intelligence post.Mr. Trump told reporters late Thursday that he was considering Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the intelligence committee, but Mr. Collins took himself out of the running the next morning.Mr. Collins, who helped lead the president's impeachment defense, had received no advance notice that he was under consideration for the top intelligence post. He saw no reason to entertain a job he did not want, especially as he wages a special election battle for a Senate seat in his home state of Georgia.""I know the problems in our intelligence community, but this is not a job that interests me at this time,"" Mr. Collins said on Fox Business. ""It's not one that I would accept because I'm running a Senate race.""People close to Mr. Collins have speculated that the president might have been trying to entice Mr. Collins out of that election to tamp down a messy intraparty fight that could cost Republicans control of the seat. Party leaders have converged around Senator Kelly Loeffler since Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia appointed her to fill the state's vacant Senate seat late last year and have made no secret of their disdain for Mr. Collins's refusal to exit the race.A nomination to a cabinet-level position would have required Mr. Collins to drop out of the race. But given his lack of intelligence experience and political track record, there was little likelihood the Senate would have confirmed him to the post.With Mr. Collins off the table, Mr. Trump will need another potential nominee. The White House is considering Pete Hoekstra, the former Republican congressman who is now the American ambassador to the Netherlands, according to three officials.Whether the Senate would be willing to formally consider Mr. Hoekstra is unclear. But if Mr. Trump were to send a nomination to the Senate it would, under federal law, allow Mr. Grenell to serve for at least another six months.In a statement praising Mr. Maguire and Mr. Hallman, Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, made no reference to Mr. Grenell.On Friday, questions arose about Mr. Grenell's past employment after ProPublica reported that he had done work for a Moldovan oligarch named Vladimir Plahotniuc who was banned from entering the United States because of his involvement in significant corruption.Mr. Grenell wrote articles defending Mr. Plahotniuc but did not disclose he had been paid for his work, ProPublica reported. A lawyer speaking on Mr. Grenell's behalf said he was not required to register with the Justice Department because he was not working at the direction of a foreign power.David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.PhotographAs the new acting director of national intelligence, Richard Grenell has access to any state secrets he may want to review.

| Jump to first hitRepresentative Adam B. Schiff took a risk in telling senators they must convict and remove President Trump because ""you know you can't trust this president to do what's right for this country.""WASHINGTON -- Senator James M. Inhofe, a conservative Republican from Oklahoma, has made clear that he intends to vote to acquit President Trump. But after Representative Adam B. Schiff's fiery speech Thursday night calling for the president's removal, Mr. Inhofe felt compelled to give his fellow lawmaker some grudging respect.""I have to say this,"" Mr. Inhofe told reporters Friday morning in the Capitol. ""Schiff is very, very effective.""Mr. Schiff, a California Democrat who steered the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump and is the lead prosecutor in his Senate trial, has long been a hero to the left and a villain to the right. But never has he aroused as much passion as he has during his closing arguments in the president's impeachment trial.First, there was Thursday's declaration that ""you know you can't trust this president to do what's right for this country,"" and then on Friday, he invoked a news report that Republican senators had been warned that their heads would be ""on a pike"" if they voted against Mr. Trump.On Friday morning, the phrase #RightMatters -- from the last line of Mr. Schiff's Thursday speech -- was trending as a hashtag on Twitter. The Daily Beast declared that the remarks ""will go down in history."" Ryan Knight, a progressive activist, called it ""a closing statement for the ages."" Video of the speech quickly went viral. Liberals lavished him with praise.""I am in tears,"" wrote Debra Messing, the ""Will & Grace"" actress and outspoken Trump critic. ""Thank you Chairman Schiff for fighting for our country.""Republicans had precisely the opposite reaction. Many view Mr. Schiff, 59, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, as a slick and self-righteous political operator intent on undoing the results of the 2016 election -- or preventing Mr. Trump from winning in 2020. In the Senate, Republicans took particular umbrage at his declaration that they could not trust the president.""I don't trust Adam Schiff,"" Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, shot back.On Fox News, Mr. Schiff was filleted. ""Amateur Thespian Schiff Tries Out Some New Lines,"" TV monitors broadcasting the network declared Thursday, as the host Tucker Carlson mocked the congressman, calling him a ""wild-eyed conspiracy nut.""And if Mr. Schiff had made any inroads with Republicans in the Senate chamber, he may have undercut them on Friday with his ""head on a pike"" remark, drawn from an anonymously sourced CBS News report. Mr. Schiff used it to liken Mr. Trump to a monarch, but the implication was that Republicans were terrified of crossing him.""The whole room was visibly upset on our side,"" said Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, ""and it's sad, it's insulting and demeaning to everyone to say that we somehow live in fear and that the president has threatened all of us to put our head on the pike.""A Stanford- and Harvard-educated lawyer, Mr. Schiff is drawing on skills he honed as a young federal prosecutor in Los Angeles. He first drew national attention in 1990 by winning the conviction of an F.B.I. agent who became romantically entangled with a Russian spy, and was accused of selling government secrets in exchange for promises of gold and cash.Prosecutors said Mr. Schiff took a risk in his bald declaration Thursday night that the president could not be trusted because Republicans in the chamber, almost all of whom support Mr. Trump, would see the criticism as implicitly directed at them.""When you make an argument like that, you better be sure that your entire audience is with you,"" said James G. McGovern, a criminal defense lawyer at Hogan Lovells in New York and a former prosecutor.Multiple Republicans said afterward that they had not at all been moved by Mr. Schiff. ""It seems to me their case is weaker today than it was yesterday,"" said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Senate Republican.But Anne Milgram, a former attorney general of New Jersey and now a law professor at New York University, described Mr. Schiff's sharp criticism of Mr. Trump as a ""wise calculation,"" because unlike a regular jury trial, Mr. Schiff does not need a unanimous verdict. The argument was aimed, she said, at the four or so moderate Republicans whose votes Democrats will need to call witnesses at the trial.Regardless of the risk, it was clear on both sides of the aisle -- and to experienced prosecutors who watched -- that after a long day of complicated and sometimes monotonous testimony, Mr. Schiff's oratory broke through. Mr. Schiff apparently thought so himself. He posted the last eight minutes, the most dramatic part of his speech, on Twitter Thursday night, and by Friday evening it had been viewed 5.9 million times.""Sometimes when Schiff steps to the mic I think he's a little scripted,"" Ms. Milgram said. ""I did not feel that last night. I thought it was the most authentic I have seen him. He sort of crossed into another level.""Mr. Schiff opened by carefully leading the Senate through the House's case that the president abused his office by trying to enlist Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, weaving in bits and pieces of testimony and commentary along the way. He then turned to his Senate audience and stated what he believes to be the obvious: Mr. Trump is guilty.""Do we really have any doubt about the facts here?"" Mr. Schiff asked. ""Does anybody really question whether the president is capable of what he's charged with? No one is really making the argument Donald Trump would never do such a thing, because of course we know that he would, and of course we know that he did.""But that, Mr. Schiff said, led to the most critical question of all: ""Does he really need to be removed?"" The answer was yes, Mr. Schiff said, then offered a situation in which the Russians interfered in the 2020 election to help Mr. Trump, just as they did in 2016.""Can you have the least bit of confidence that Donald Trump will stand up to them and protect our national interest over his own personal interest?"" Mr. Schiff said. ""You know you can't, which makes him dangerous to this country.""In the Capitol, Mr. Schiff is ordinarily serious, composed and in control. But as he moved toward his closing comments, he grew visibly emotional as he recalled the testimony of Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the White House national security aide and Ukrainian immigrant who testified in impeachment hearings before Congress and helped Democrats build their case.Colonel Vindman, who fled the former Soviet Union with his family when he was 3, testified that he felt deeply uncomfortable with a telephone call Mr. Trump had on July 25 with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, when Mr. Trump asked the Ukrainian leader to ""do us a favor"" and investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.Mr. Schiff recalled how Colonel Vindman told lawmakers that unlike in the former Soviet Union, ""right matters"" in the United States.""Well, let me tell you something,"" Mr. Schiff went on, his forefinger jabbing the air for emphasis. ""If right doesn't matter, if right doesn't matter, it doesn't matter how good the Constitution is. It doesn't matter how brilliant the framers were. Doesn't matter how good or bad our advocacy in this trial is."" If ""right doesn't matter,"" he concluded, ""we're lost.""Michael D.

| Jump to first hitThe Democrats in Iowa are making a furious last-minute case against the president. So is a Tea Party hero.DES MOINES -- The line outside the Trump rally on Thursday night was perhaps not the safest space to try to conduct a Socratic dialogue about the nature of truth. But Joe Walsh -- former Tea Party congressman, former right-wing radio host, current Trump opponent -- leaned right in.""I'm a Republican and a conservative and I'm challenging Trump in the primary,"" he announced to a Trump supporter festooned in campaign-themed clothing. ""Let me ask you this: Has Donald Trump ever lied to the American people?""A nanosecond passed, while the supporter bristled at this unfamiliar scenario. ""Nothing comes to mind,"" he said.Mr. Walsh mentioned that President Trump, despite promising fiscal responsibility, had presided over an increase in the federal deficit greater than that under President Barack Obama.""I couldn't speak to that,"" said the supporter, who did not want to give his name, on account of not trusting reporters. ""Sometimes we say things and they might not be full of truth, but we all make mistakes. He's a straight guy. I love his tenacity.""Another supporter had been growing noticeably agitated as he heard this exchange. (He also did not want to give his name.) ""Let me ask you something!"" he said. ""Has Adam Schiff ever lied?"" he asked, referring to Representative Adam B. Schiff, a lead impeachment manager. ""What about 'Shifty Schiff'? You're like Adam Schiff"" -- he pointed at Mr. Walsh -- ""lying to the American people!""If it is hard to be a Democratic candidate in the crowded and uncertain 2020 field, it may be even harder to be a Republican trying to present a legitimate alternative to a president whose supporters won't entertain the idea of anyone else, and who is all but certain to be the party's nominee.Mr. Trump won Iowa with 51 percent of the vote in 2016 and still has high approval ratings from the state's Republicans. But if local party members were feeling rather left out this past week with so much focus on the Democrats -- all those candidates, all those events -- the president had swooped in to remind them that there was a new election coming up and that, as he said on Twitter, he was ""America's Greatest President."" And Mr. Walsh was there to present a countermessage: No, he wasn't.There used to be three Republican challengers -- Mr. Walsh, former Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts and former Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina -- but Mr. Sanford dropped out just two months after entering the race, and now there are two.The odds are never great for same-party challengers when an incumbent president runs for re-election. But the candidates say that as Mr. Trump has consolidated his hold over the Republican Party, things have gotten increasingly difficult. For one thing, the party has, in 37 states and territories, changed the rules for choosing delegates to the Republican National Convention, a move likely to limit dissenting voices on the convention floor.Also, many state Republican committees have canceled this year's primaries altogether; others have put up prohibitively difficult barriers for challengers to enter or said they would hold primaries with just a single name -- Donald J. Trump -- on the ballot.""They're behind Trump lock and key,"" Mr. Walsh said. When he showed up at the Republican National Committee in Washington last month to lodge a complaint about what he said was ""the disenfranchisement of millions of Republican voters,"" the guards wouldn't let him past the lobby.Mr. Weld gamely made his own voice-in-the-wilderness case to several dozen people at Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa, on Saturday. He was joined by Jim Leach, a longtime member of Congress from Iowa and former chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, whose public endorsement of Mr. Weld seems like a daring move in the current climate. (""The only reason I can is that I am not an elected official,"" Mr. Leach said by telephone.)In a phone interview, Mr. Weld said he felt like ""a two-headed cow at the Iowa State Fair,"" a figure of curiosity on account of his uphill campaign. He said that many Republicans shared his view of the president but were afraid to say so.""The party may be redeemable, but the president is not redeemable,"" he said. ""He's gone too far in the direction of wanting to undermine democratic institutions to amass power for himself. ""He and Mr. Walsh have also been making their case to voters in one-on-one conversations in bars and coffee shops in Des Moines in the lead-up to Monday's caucuses. James Marren, who showed up at the Exile bar to talk to Mr. Walsh the other night, said that he had encountered the candidate before, at a veterans' group in Dubuque, and that he was a changed man from his days as a right-wing, pro-Trump radio host spouting incendiary conspiracy theories.""It was all Democrats and him,"" said Mr. Marren, 75, a Democrat so impressed by Mr. Walsh that he is talking him up to his Republican friends. ""He said that Trump's a liar and a traitor. He apologized for what he used to say on his radio show. He was amazing.""But at the Trump rally, it was a different story. Virtually everyone Mr. Walsh spoke to disagreed with virtually everything he said.When he mentioned Ukraine, a Trump supporter said that ""Obama got that started."" When Mr. Walsh pointed out that Mr. Trump had vowed to make Mexico pay for the border wall, but was instead using money from the United States military budget, another supporter first said that Mexico was indeed paying for it, in that there are fewer Mexicans crossing the border and thus fewer Mexicans sending ""American money"" back home. Then she said: ""Well, he would have made the Mexican government pay for it, but a lot of people are standing in his way.""After just a few minutes of these encounters, Mr. Walsh was beginning to seem like the most masochistic person in Iowa.""These are the people who listened to me on the radio"" when he was a darling of the right, he said. ""I can relate to why they voted for Trump. I voted for him in 2016. But then I saw that he lies damn near every time he opens his mouth.""The turning point for him was Mr. Trump's 2018 meeting in Helsinki with Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, in which Mr. Trump said he believed Mr. Putin's claim -- contrary to American intelligence -- that Russia had not interfered in the 2016 election. ""That was the most unpatriotic thing I've ever seen an American president do,"" Mr. Walsh said.Suddenly, in line, Mr. Walsh ran into an old neighbor from Chicago, Mark Weyermuller, who had supported him in his congressional days but had traveled to Des Moines on this occasion for the president.It was an awkward encounter. ""You know they've canceled the Republican primaries in 10 states,"" Mr. Walsh said.Mr. Weyermuller said that he had not heard that before but that it was ""sort of a goofy system.""""I'm happy for you, but I'm supporting Donald J. Trump,"" he said, and he moved on.Then there was Matt Locke, a.k.a. the Conservative Sharpshooter, a talk-radio and podcast host who had traveled from Texas to spend an evening listening to Mr. Trump.""You're a Tea Party guy, Joe,"" Mr. Locke said. ""What happened?""The two talked at loud cross-purposes about topics like corruption among Ukrainian prosecutors; Democrats who have foreign investments; and, once again, whether Mr. Trump has ever lied. (""I don't know,"" Mr. Locke said sarcastically. ""Has he?"") The discussion turned to the time Mr. Trump publicly invited China to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his family.""He wasn't serious!"" Mr. Locke said. ""He was joking. You gotta have a sense of humor.""The two agreed to vehemently disagree, and Mr. Walsh went off into the cold to find some other voters who also disagreed with him.""I don't mind Joe,"" said Mr. Locke, ""but he doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell.""PhotographJoe Walsh, a former Republican congressman, tried to find an audience outside President Trump's rally in Des Moines on Thursday.

| Jump to first hit""Unfortunately, this virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration,"" Mr. Biden said. In his own address, Mr. Sanders said the coronavirus crisis was ""on the scale of major war.""WILMINGTON, Del. -- Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday delivered a forceful rebuke of President Trump's leadership amid the coronavirus crisis, seeking to project steadiness and resolve from his perch as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.In his own speech about the pandemic, Senator Bernie Sanders, Mr. Biden's main rival, also flamed the president's response. He provided a long list of policy proposals aimed in particular at helping low-income and working-class families, providing a glimpse of the extraordinary measures he might take if he were president.""The crisis we face from the coronavirus is on a scale of a major war,"" he said at a news conference in Burlington, Vt. ""And we must act accordingly.""Taken together, the candidates' blistering denunciations of the president's handling of the outbreak signaled that the coronavirus has fully overtaken the 2020 race, forcing the candidates to cancel events and propose new ways of campaigning, putting fresh political pressure on Mr. Trump, and placing matters of public health and trust at the forefront of the contest.Mr. Biden, the former vice president, spoke Thursday afternoon from the Hotel du Pont in Wilmington, Del., about the grave challenges the country faces, and he detailed his ideas for managing the outbreak. He also aimed to draw sharp contrasts with Mr. Trump a day after the president addressed the nation from the Oval Office, establishing a preview of what Mr. Biden hopes will be a general election matchup.""Unfortunately, this virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration,"" Mr. Biden said, speaking from the hotel where he announced his 1972 bid for the Senate. ""Public fears are being compounded by pervasive lack of trust in this president fueled by adversarial relationship with the truth that he continues to have.""This moment of national anxiety, some of Mr. Biden's allies believe, throws into sharp relief the choice Americans would face in a general-election matchup between Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump, and the stakes of that contest. Mr. Biden has been seeking to frame the race as a two-person contest against the president, in ways overt and subtle, even as he continues a primary battle with Mr. Sanders.In his remarks, Mr. Biden offered his own plan for combating the virus, with proposals that included rapidly and vastly expanding testing -- tests, he said, should be available at no charge -- moving aggressively to boost hospital capacity and supporting an accelerated push for a vaccine that he said should be ""again, free of charge."" And he argued that ""the administration's failure on testing is colossal.""""We are not ready yet, and the clock is ticking,"" he warned.He also described plans to help those who are struggling financially at a time of economic peril, appeared dismissive of corporate tax subsidies and said it was a ""national disgrace that millions of our fellow citizens don't have a single day of paid sick leave.""Mr. Sanders, for his part, urged the president to declare the pandemic a national emergency, and encouraged the public and private sectors to work together to combat the virus and its effects. Like Mr. Biden, he outlined a list of recommendations to deal with the pandemic, including establishing national and state information hotlines, making all treatment ""free of charge,"" providing ""emergency unemployment assistance"" to those who lose their jobs, and expanding the Meals on Wheels and school lunch programs and SNAP ""so that no one goes hungry during this crisis."" He also urged a ""moratorium on evictions, on foreclosures and on utility shut offs.""Perhaps above all, he used the health crisis as another opportunity to call for his signature health care plan, ""Medicare for all.""""Our country is at a severe disadvantage compared to every other major country on earth because we do not guarantee health care to all people as a right,"" he said.His remarks amounted to a vigorous critique of Mr. Trump, cloaked in the kind of sweeping, uncompromising proposals that have long defined his democratic socialist agenda. He left the news conference without taking questions.Mr. Biden's appearance here in Delaware came as his campaign underwent another shake-up after an initial shuffling last month. He brought on a new campaign manager as his team works to build out what has been an underfunded operation with major organizational challenges -- despite a flurry of primary victories over the past two weeks.Amid those successes, Mr. Biden has further intensified his focus on Mr. Trump, acting as if the general election were already underway. On Wednesday, his team announced the formation of a ""Public Health Advisory Committee"" studded with prominent health leaders and alumni of former President Barack Obama's administration -- a rollout that seemed intended to conjure the actions a president might take.Members included Vivek Murthy, a former surgeon general; Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a prominent oncologist and a vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania; and Lisa Monaco, who served as a homeland security and counterterrorism adviser to Mr. Obama. And when he spoke on Thursday, he did so against a backdrop of American flags, reading from teleprompters to the click of cameras and beginning with a nod to his ""fellow Americans,"" a setting reminiscent of a White House address.""No president can promise to prevent future outbreaks,"" he said. ""But I can promise you this. When I'm president, we will be better prepared, respond better and recover better. We'll lead with science. We'll listen to the experts. We'll heed their advice. And we'll build American leadership and rebuild it to rally the world to meet the global threats.""Throughout his remarks, Mr. Biden nodded -- as he often does -- to what he cast as the resiliency and potential of the American people.Mr. Biden, who is 77, did not stop to take shouted questions about his own health.He has previously expressed shock and frustration at Mr. Trump's past skeptical remarks about the severity of the virus, and has sketched out other steps he would take as president to fight it, noting his work as vice president in combating Ebola. Ron Klain, who was Mr. Obama's Ebola ""czar,"" is a top Biden adviser.Mr. Trump's own somber address Wednesday night, in which he announced he was blocking most travel from continental Europe and promised new aid for workers and businesses, was a break from his previous efforts to play down the effects of the outbreak. But he also mischaracterized some of his administration's new travel policies and described the threat as a ""foreign virus,"" though Americans are infected along with many in other countries.The Trump campaign quickly issued a response to Mr. Biden's remarks on Thursday. ""In times like this, America needs leadership and Biden has shown none,"" said Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman. ""President Trump acted early and decisively and has put the United States on stronger footing than other nations. His every move has been aimed at keeping Americans safe, while Joe Biden has sought to capitalize politically and stoke citizens' fears.""As for Mr. Sanders, Mr. Murtaugh said in another statement, ""He's just another Democrat candidate for president trying to score political points by recklessly provoking anxiety and fear."" He also argued that the proposal from Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator -- who supports a sweeping single-payer system -- would ""drive doctors and other medical workers away from the profession, leaving America woefully unprepared for public health emergencies.""Even as the candidates sought to project images of leadership, they are still politicians who face another debate and another round of primary elections in the coming days, and they are scrambling to adjust to a presidential contest now unfolding amid a pandemic.In one sign of the major changes the virus is forcing on the presidential race, Mr. Biden's team on Wednesday announced that previously scheduled campaign events in Chicago and Miami would be transformed into ""virtual events"" ahead of next Tuesday's primaries in Illinois, Florida and several other large, delegate-rich states. And Mr. Biden -- whose famously tactile campaigning style is off-putting to some and delights others -- acknowledged the need for ""radical changes in our personal behaviors"" that could affect ""deeply ingrained behavior like handshakes and hugs.""An internal campaign memo released Thursday instructed all staff members to begin working from home starting on Saturday, announced the closing of all offices to the public and said that the campaign would ""hold smaller events like roundtables, house parties, and press statements, as well as virtual events."" Fund-raisers, the memo said, would ""become virtual fund-raisers indefinitely.""Mr. Sanders likewise canceled a rally in Cleveland on Tuesday, and his campaign has not scheduled any new public events. Jane Sanders, Mr. Sanders's wife, told reporters on Thursday after he concluded his remarks that he would return to the Senate after the debate, and that he would stay in Washington.Still, surrogates are continuing to make the rounds in key upcoming contests, and volunteers may be encouraged to head to states like Illinois and Georgia to help with activities like door-knocking, according to Dick Harpootlian, a South Carolina state senator and a Biden supporter who has been in touch with the campaign.The remarks on Thursday were not the first time Mr. Biden has sought to assume the mantle of a sober, statesmanlike leader through a highly produced speech: In January, he delivered a sharp rebuke of Mr. Trump's stewardship of tensions with Iran against a backdrop that appeared reminiscent of the White House briefing room.Yet that issue faded from the national forefront, and Mr. Biden went on to a fourth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses a few weeks later as he competed against what was, at the time, a crowded and competitive Democratic field.He entered this speech, however, having amassed a big delegate advantage, and facing just one Democratic opponent, Mr. Sanders.Katie Glueck reported from Wilmington, Del., and Sydney Ember from Burlington, Vt.PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders denounced President Trump's handling of the outbreak.

| Jump to first hitThe secretary of state will ""reaffirm U.S. support for Ukraine's sovereignty,"" becoming the first cabinet official to meet with the Ukrainian leader since President Trump's impeachment inquiry began.WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo plans to meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in Kyiv on Friday, the State Department said Monday.Mr. Pompeo will be the highest-ranking member of the United States government to meet with the Ukrainian president since Vice President Mike Pence met with him in Warsaw on Sept. 1 and the first cabinet official to meet with him since the formal start of the impeachment inquiry, which centers on President Trump's interactions with Mr. Zelensky and his government.Since that inquiry began in late September, Mr. Pompeo has tried to maintain his distance from the Ukraine issue. He has refused to release State Department documents demanded by impeachment investigators in the House and has declined to speak in any detail about his own role in the affair.But on several occasions, he has reiterated some of Mr. Trump's positions on potential investigations related to Ukraine. And he has refrained from publicly supporting ambassadors and senior diplomats who have testified before Congress and come under attack by Mr. Trump. That has contributed to a sharp drop in morale at the State Department.Mr. Pompeo intends to ""reaffirm U.S. support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity"" on his trip, the State Department said, a reference to the yearslong war that Ukraine is fighting against a Russian-backed insurgency in the east. The State Department said Mr. Pompeo plans to lay a wreath at the monastery of St. Michael's in Kyiv to ""honor those who have fallen in the Donbass,"" the region where the war is unfolding.Mr. Pompeo also plans to meet with Ukraine's foreign and defense ministers, as well as with religious, civic and business figures, the State Department said.The Democratic-led House impeached Mr. Trump along a party-line vote for abuse of power and obstruction on Dec. 18. The abuse of power article rests on the fact that Mr. Trump pressed Mr. Zelensky for political favors while the White House withheld from Kyiv $391 million of military aid that had been approved by Pentagon and State Department officials and required by Congress.Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelensky in a July 25 telephone call ""to do us a favor"" by looking into a conspiracy theory about a Democratic National Committee server and Russia-promoted disinformation that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 United States presidential election. Mr. Pompeo was on the call.Mr. Trump also asked Mr. Zelensky to look into unsubstantiated claims that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a leading 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, engaged in corrupt acts related to his son Hunter and a Ukrainian company.Mr. Pompeo's visit comes a month after Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, visited Kyiv seeking to meet with former Ukrainian prosecutors whose allegations of corruption played a role in Mr. Giuliani's and pro-Trump news organizations' promotion of claims about Mr. Biden and his son.In March, after at least two telephone calls with Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Pompeo ordered the recall of the American ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch. Mr. Giuliani and associates tied to Ukrainian businesspeople had pushed for the ouster of Ms. Yovanovitch, who was known for promoting anti-corruption efforts in Kyiv.Mr. Pompeo picked a veteran diplomat, William B. Taylor Jr., to replace her as head of mission, but Mr. Taylor became concerned over the summer about the withheld aid, writing in a cable dated Aug. 29 that the administration's action was ""folly."" Mr. Taylor later testified to Congress, infuriating Mr. Trump.Mr. Taylor was scheduled to leave his post in January, but a close aide to Mr. Pompeo, T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, asked Mr. Taylor to turn over his duties to the deputy chief of mission on Jan. 1, before Mr. Pompeo's arrival, a person with knowledge of the discussion said. That would allow Mr. Pompeo to avoid interacting with Mr. Taylor, who then chose to leave Ukraine on Jan. 2.In late August, Mr. Pompeo joined John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, and Mark T. Esper, the defense secretary, to argue to Mr. Trump in an Oval Office meeting that the White House should release the aid, but Mr. Trump ignored their recommendation. Around the same time, Mr. Trump was told about a whistle-blower complaint filed by a C.I.A. officer on the issue, and separately members of Congress were pressing for the aid to be released. On Sept. 11, Mr. Trump ordered an end to the hold.Two senior State Department officials spoke with reporters on Monday about Mr. Pompeo's upcoming trip, which also includes stops in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Cyprus, but declined to answer repeated questions about the pressure from the White House on Mr. Zelensky.Mr. Pompeo spoke in general terms about the impeachment process when asked about it on ""Fox and Friends"" on Monday. ""Whatever happens here in Washington, the American people should know that President Trump and our national security team are focused on keeping them safe,"" he said.In mid-December, Mr. Pompeo unveiled a personal Twitter account, which added to speculation that he plans to run for Senate from his home state of Kansas. But Mr. Pompeo dismissed the idea. ""As long as President Trump wants me to serve in this capacity, there's still work to do,"" he said. ""I've watched my life take turns that one would never have expected, but it's not something I want to do.""PhotographPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine was pressured for political favors while the White House withheld from Kyiv $391 million of military aid that had been approved by Congress.

| Jump to first hitThe intention, with no commitment to calling witnesses or admitting new evidence, foreshadows a partisan vote to kick off a divisive proceeding.WASHINGTON -- Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, said Tuesday that he planned to move forward with President Trump's impeachment trial without committing to calling witnesses or hearing new evidence, foreshadowing a partisan vote to kick off a divisive proceeding.His decision deepened a standoff over the shape of a Senate trial that has gripped the Capitol in the weeks since the House voted to impeach Mr. Trump. But hours later, Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated it may not persist much longer, saying that she would ""soon"" transmit the two articles of impeachment, though not before Mr. McConnell made public the rules for the process.Mr. McConnell shared his intentions with senators over lunch in the Capitol, declaring that he had the votes he needed -- including among moderate Republicans -- to steamroll over Democratic objections and proceed with the trial that puts off final decisions on whether to consider evidence.That would mean the Senate would tackle those questions only after representatives of the House and the president make opening arguments and senators question both sides.""We have the votes,"" Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, told reporters afterward. He said he modeled his plan on the procedures used during the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton in 1999, the Senate's only modern precedent.""All we are doing here is saying we are going to get started in exactly the same way 100 senators agreed to 20 years ago,"" he said. ""What was good enough for President Clinton is good enough for President Trump.""But this time, both the facts of the case and the politics are far different. Mr. Trump directed a campaign to stonewall the House impeachment inquiry, barring testimony from some of his closest advisers and refusing to provide any documents.Mr. McConnell has promised a speedy acquittal, and Democrats charge that his refusal to hear from witnesses who could bolster the case against the president is tantamount to a cover-up. They are expected to oppose Mr. McConnell's resolution almost unanimously.After weeks of quiet haggling, the majority leader's announcement signaled that the traditionally cordial Senate was poised to begin a proceeding of high historical consequence just as polarized as the more volatile House, which split along party lines in charging Mr. Trump.Ms. Pelosi, returning to the Capitol for the first time in the new year, said she still wanted more detail from Mr. McConnell about what precise procedures he would follow before naming the lawmakers who will prosecute the case.""It is important that he immediately publish this resolution, so that, as I have said before, we can see the arena in which we will be participating, appoint managers and transmit the articles to the Senate,"" she said in a letter to colleagues released a short time later.She accused Mr. McConnell of being loyal to Mr. Trump rather than the Constitution and pursuing a trial ""designed to deprive senators and the American people of crucial documents and testimony.""A decision to transmit the articles could come as soon as this week, though a series of Iranian attacks on American forces early Wednesday in Iraq left the exact timing in doubt.For his part, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, promised to force a series of votes on calling John R. Bolton, the former White House national security adviser, and three other witnesses and document requests at the outset of the trial. Republicans could defeat the motions, but Democrats hope that some of them would instead break ranks, unwilling to go on the record against additional fact-finding in a trial of constitutional consequence.""If you are afraid of the facts, if you are afraid of what would come out, if you want to cover it up, even in something as weighty and serious as impeachment, then you say no witnesses and documents,"" Mr. Schumer said at a news conference.He predicted a handful of Republicans could end up supporting summonses for witnesses like Mr. Bolton or Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, whom Mr. Trump effectively blocked from testifying in the House.But for now, even moderate Republicans and those up for re-election this year were sticking with Mr. McConnell. Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have both expressed interest in potentially calling witnesses during the trial, but they have come around to Mr. McConnell's argument that the matter should be debated only after opening arguments.""I had certainly hoped that over the holidays, Leader McConnell and Senator Schumer would have been able to come to terms of an agreement,"" Ms. Murkowski said on Tuesday. Instead, she conceded, they had become hopelessly ""snarled up"" in the debate over witnesses.The renewed posturing came a day after Mr. Bolton said he would now be willing to testify if subpoenaed by the Senate. Other impeachment witnesses and people close to him have said Mr. Bolton could provide an unflattering account of Mr. Trump's decisions to withhold a White House meeting and almost $400 million in military aid from Ukraine as he sought investigations there that would benefit him politically.At the White House, the president played down Mr. Bolton's significance as a witness, and said that impeachment was perhaps ""the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on our country.""""He would know nothing about what we're talking about,"" Mr. Trump said of Mr. Bolton, who left the White House in September amid policy disputes with the president.The House's inquiry concluded in December that Mr. Trump had withheld the White House meeting and security aid as leverage to coerce Ukraine's new president to announce investigations smearing former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats.The goal, according to an abuse of power charge, was to bolster Mr. Trump's re-election campaign. The president was also charged with obstruction of Congress for his blanket stonewalling of the impeachment inquiry, which the House called an effort by Mr. Trump to conceal his conduct from the legislative branch.It is that stonewalling that has animated Senate Democrats' drive to secure a pledge to include additional witnesses and documents at trial.Unlike in 1999, when testimony from every major witness had already been made public by the time the case came to trial, Mr. Trump has succeeded in withholding from Congress nearly every piece of documentary evidence related to the case and a dozen witnesses with knowledge of his actions.Senate rules require only a simple majority -- 51 senators -- to call witnesses, and with a handful of Republicans professing at least some interest in doing so, additional testimony is still possible. Three witnesses were eventually called in Mr. Clinton's trial, all of whom had been interviewed in the inquiry that led to the charges.But Mr. McConnell's plan offers no such guarantee, and he is betting that once a trial is underway, the desire to bring it swiftly to a close may persuade members of his own party not to join Democrats.""There will be, I'm sure, intense discussion once you get past phase one about the whole witness issue,"" Mr. McConnell said, playing down Democrats' concerns.With the president's eventual acquittal by the Senate all but certain, both parties have tried to leverage the pause between impeachment and the trial for their own advantage.Democrats argue that it has forced individual Republicans senators to go on the record about their intentions and highlighted what they see as Mr. McConnell's intention to help Mr. Trump hide his wrongdoing. The intervening time, they say, has also allowed for new documents and evidence to become public through news reports and public records requests that the administration refused to hand over.""Pelosi is very good at this. She will know when the lemon has been fully squeezed,"" said Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont. ""But at the end of the day, the House impeaches and the Senate tries.""Some Senate Democrats appear to be losing patience.""Our best leverage right now over Republicans is votes inside the Senate trial,"" said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut. ""We should probably get to the point where we can put Republicans on record as soon as possible.""Republicans have assailed Democrats for what they contend is political gamesmanship and hypocrisy, after having asserted for weeks that impeaching Mr. Trump was an urgent matter.Republican leaders conducted a whip count to confirm support for the plan in their party. Though they did not publicize the results, it appeared all 53 senators in the Republican conference would vote with Mr. McConnell at the outset of the trial.At least one, however, suggested that he might ultimately side with Democrats during the proceeding and vote to call witnesses.""Going with the Clinton impeachment process is satisfactory to me because that process did provide, down the road, for an opportunity to hear from witnesses,"" Senator Mitt Romney said. ""And I would like to hear from John Bolton.""Emily Cochrane and Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.PhotographMitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, addressing the procedures for a prospective impeachment trial, said on Tuesday: ""What was good enough for President Clinton is good enough for President Trump."" Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, is under increasing pressure to deliver to the Senate the charges voted against Mr. Trump.

| Jump to first hitLatino voters in California, Texas and around the country are invested in picking someone who can beat President Trump, though they don't all agree on who that is.LOS ANGELES -- Latino voters are poised to pick the Democratic nominee.Long overlooked by the political establishment and dismissed as a sleeping giant of a demographic that didn't vote as reliably as it could, millions of Latinos are expected to go to the polls on Tuesday in key states like Colorado, Virginia, North Carolina and, most significantly, in Texas and California.One analysis estimates that roughly one-third of the 643 delegates up for grabs in those two states will be determined by Latino voters.Latinos are expected to make up the largest nonwhite ethnic voting bloc in 2020. Around the country, Latino Democrats are seeking the candidate who is best poised to take on President Trump, who many believe has placed a target on their own backs with his anti-immigrant rhetoric. These voters, far from a monolith but united on some key issues, will cast their ballots in Texas exactly seven months after the deadliest anti-Latino attack in modern American history took place in El Paso.""It's hard to be Latino right now,"" said Christian Arana, the policy director for the Latino Community Foundation, a philanthropic group based in California. ""There are so many of us who feel we have to constantly be on the watch for something terrible. People are channeling their anger into voting in a way we have not seen historically.""Polls have consistently shown that Latino voters in Texas and California list health care, economic inequality and immigration as their top issues. But the upcoming primaries are likely to show the splits and contradictions among the group. Interviews with dozens of Latino voters in El Paso and Los Angeles in recent days show that though Mr. Sanders has built up a loyal base among Latinos, particularly younger and working-class voters, there are many lifelong Democrats who are still searching for a moderate alternative.""It's a historic moment and a historic disappointment because yet again we are the most underinvested community from the establishment and the big donors and yet still in every election, the Latino voting segment keeps growing,"" said Héctor Sánchez Barba, the executive director of Mi Familia Vota, which does Latino voter outreach throughout the country. In 2018, Latino voters helped flip several Congressional districts to the Democrats.Now, he said, is the time Latino groups are pressing to get more promises from candidates on what they will do on health care, education and immigration.Democratic candidates have made more of an effort in recent weeks to court Latino voters, recognizing the decisive role they could play on Super Tuesday. No other candidate has put more effort into courting Latinos than Senator Bernie Sanders, who has made it clear that he is counting on Latinos as a kind of firewall on Tuesday, nationally and particularly in California. So far, recent surveys seem to reflect that effort: Mr. Sanders has a significant lead among Latino voters in both Texas and California, ahead of his rivals by double digits.""We've lived in fear for our families for the last three years,"" said Janette Espino, a 26-year-old sports merchandising buyer from Long Beach, Calif., who attended a rally for Mr. Sanders in Los Angeles Sunday. Ms. Espino said health care was the most important issue for her, but added that she has several family members who are undocumented immigrants. She said several of other family members had become citizens in the last two years and planned to cast their first ballot Tuesday, choosing Mr. Sanders. ""We've never had a candidate for president who listened to us like this, who we are really excited about.""Seeming to recognize the need for more of an effort targeting the Latino community, Joseph R. Biden Jr. held rallies in Texas leading up to Super Tuesday, and touted the endorsement of Congresswoman Veronica Escobar of El Paso. And on Saturday, four former Latino cabinet secretaries from the Clinton and Obama administrations published a letter in La Opinion, Los Angeles' largest Spanish-language newspaper, urging their ""Latino brothers and sisters"" to vote for Mr. Biden, arguing that they ""know Joe"" and that he is ""running to restore the American dream.""Former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has poured in a record-breaking amount of money into Spanish-language advertising in California and Texas. Mr. Bloomberg's campaign has focused particularly on finding local endorsements from heavily Latino regions and featuring those leaders in ""Ganamos Con Mike"" advertisements.Like Mr. Sanders's campaign, Mr. Bloomberg has opened field offices in heavily Latino regions that have long been ignored in presidential elections, such as the Central Valley and the Inland Empire in California. The campaign has also sent millions of campaign mailers to Hispanic voters in both states.""What used to happen was you avoided talking about Latinos until Florida,"" said Mayra Macías, the executive director of Latino Victory Fund, which tries to get more Latinos elected and backed Mr. Biden last month. ""Now we are seeing that there is no path to victory without speaking holistically to them.""In some ways, California Latinos began their steady march to political power after Proposition 187, an anti-immigrant ballot initiative approved by voters in 1994. Dozens of current Latino elected officials in the state became engaged in activism during the protests against the measure, which was eventually struck down by the courts. And many in California believe that Texas Latinos are in the midst of a similar political transformation.It has now been nearly seven months since the shooting at an El Paso Walmart. The white 21-year-old gunman, Patrick Crusius, turned a Saturday morning in the binational, majority-Hispanic border city into a scene of horror: He killed 22 people and wounded nearly two dozen others. Most of those killed or injured were either Mexicans or Mexican-Americans.Minutes before the shooting, the gunman had posted an anti-immigrant manifesto online, declaring that the attack was in response to ""the Hispanic invasion of Texas."" He wrote that he feared that the Hispanic population in Texas would make it a Democratic stronghold that would ""win nearly every presidential election.""For 27-year-old Elisa Tamayo, the shooting last year was personal. It was her neighborhood Walmart, a place to shop and meet her family from across the border. One of her mother's friends was killed in the attack -- Maria Eugenia Legarreta Rothe, 58, from the Mexican state of Chihuahua. Ms. Tamayo called her ""tía,"" Spanish for aunt, although they were not related.But for Ms. Tamayo, the attack has since veered to the political.She is running for public office for the first time in her life, pushed in part by the Walmart shooting and the rhetoric from President Trump and state Republican leaders that she believes fueled the anti-Latino hatred of the gunman. Ms. Tamayo is vying to become a Democratic lawmaker in the state House of Representatives and to represent the House district that includes the Walmart. She announced her candidacy eight weeks after the shooting, standing with relatives and supporters in front of a mural reading ""El Paso Strong.""Ms. Tamayo, who is on the Democratic primary ballot in El Paso on Tuesday and who voted for Ms. Warren for president, said that in knocking on doors for her campaign, she has seen firsthand a new level of engagement of Hispanic voters.""We've been knocking on doors for more than three months, and I keep hearing that they want to vote in this election,"" she said. ""They really want to vote in this election because they feel like we've got to get Trump out of office. Instead of saying my vote doesn't matter, I think people are now more willing to show up and more willing to vote because of that.""Around El Paso, many people described similar reasons for voting: Mr. Trump's rhetoric and the shooting last summer. But they came to different conclusions about their preferred candidates.Anna Casas, 33, a single mother and home health aide in El Paso, voted for the first time in her life last week -- her vote went to Mr. Sanders, and she had registered to vote last year about three months after the attack at the Walmart, where she would often shop with her three sons. ""What about if we were there and that happened?"" she said. ""It did open my eyes. It pushed me to vote.""Ms. Casas said it was clear to her that Mr. Trump's words fueled the shooter's hatred of Hispanics.""I'm trying to push other people to vote, because they think that their vote doesn't matter,"" she said. ""But it actually does. I used to think that way, honestly, until Trump became president.""Irma Vasquez, 67, a former school-district worker who voted for Mr. Bloomberg, put the role the president's words played in the attack this way, tugging at the skin on her cheek: ""He put a bull's-eye on our backs, especially this color.""Pedro Gandara, 74, a retired telephone-company repairman and Air Force veteran who voted for Mr. Biden, said Mr. Trump evokes for him the anti-Latino racism he has faced his entire life. He remembered being refused service at a restaurant in the Panhandle city of Amarillo when he was a high school student.""This was '63 or '64, so the racism has been here ever since, but Trump has really brought it out,"" Mr. Gandara said. ""He's very much against us all.""Perhaps no one exemplified the split of Latino Democratic voters in Texas heading into Super Tuesday better than the Balcazar family.Last Wednesday, Miguel Balcazar, 66, a retired middle-school history teacher, walked slowly to an early voting site at a recreation center in the city's Mission Valley neighborhood, a little more than two miles from the scene of the Walmart shooting. He used a cane because of his knee problems as his wife, Lucinda, 65, a retired special-education teacher's assistant, walked alongside him, just as slowly. They've been married for 41 years.They were making their way cautiously to vote, but they were eager for political revolution. When they got back to their car wearing ""I voted"" stickers, both said they had supported Mr. Sanders.""I feel strongly that he's more radical than anything else,"" Mr. Balcazar said of Mr. Sanders.Their three sons were not with them, but their parents know exactly how they will vote. One of their sons plans on voting for Mr. Sanders, one is undecided and the other will vote for Mr. Trump, a sign of the Hispanic Republican support for the president that exists in a conservative state like Texas.""I can't change his mind,"" Mr. Balcazar said, shaking his head and adding with a chuckle, ""He says, 'Dad, I'm going to put the sign up on top of your roof, because you can't get up there anymore.""'Jennifer Medina reported from Los Angeles, and Manny Fernandez from El Paso.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders, campaigning in San Jose, Calif., left, has built up a loyal base of younger and working-class Latino voters.

| Jump to first hitThe wife of former Representative Patrick Kennedy is vying to oust a congressman who pledged loyalty to President Trump.The field of Democrats vying to oust Representative Jeff Van Drew got more crowded on Monday as Amy Kennedy, the wife of former Representative Patrick Kennedy, entered the race, bringing the instant name recognition of a political dynasty to the New Jersey congressional race.Ms. Kennedy, who described herself as a former teacher and a mother of five in a minute-long YouTube video announcing her candidacy, did not mention Mr. Van Drew's defection from the Democratic Party last month or his pledge of ""undying support"" for President Trump.But the video did include an image of Mr. Van Drew shaking the president's hand in the Oval Office as he announced he would join the Republicans, one day after the South Jersey lawmaker voted against impeaching Mr. Trump. (The president repaid the favor on Monday, with his campaign saying he would appear at a rally in Mr. Van Drew's district on Jan. 28.)""Too many of our leaders have lost their moral compass,"" she said in the video clip. ""Trump and Van Drew are symptoms of a bigger sickness infecting our country and our politics.""Ms. Kennedy's husband is a former Rhode Island congressman and the son of former Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts.Mr. Van Drew, a first-term congressman who was elected as a conservative Democrat, represents a district the Republican president won by about 5 points in 2016.[Video: Watch on YouTube.]Ms. Kennedy, in the brief video, touched on what are likely to form the broad themes of her campaign: civility, climate change, mental health and addiction, and corporate tax incentives.""We continue to ignore the biggest public health emergency of our time -- the mental health and addiction crisis that affects virtually every family,"" she said.She added, ""People in South Jersey can't find good jobs, but the richest corporations pay almost no taxes.""Ms. Kennedy, who lives north of Atlantic City in Brigantine, could not be reached for comment.If Ms. Kennedy were to win the nomination, she would not be the only Kennedy campaigning for Congress. Representative Joe Kennedy III, the grandson of the former attorney general, Robert F. Kennedy, is running for the Senate from Massachusetts.Four other Democrats have already entered the primary race in the Second Congressional District, which cuts across New Jersey's southernmost counties and stretches from Cape May to the Pennsylvania border.Brigid Callahan Harrison, a professor who teaches political science at Montclair State University, announced her candidacy the same week Mr. Van Drew said he would join the Republicans, a shift that prompted most of his staff members to quit.Professor Harrison was quickly endorsed by many of the Democratic Party leaders in the district who hold sway over whose name will appear on the party's coveted ballot line in the June primary.Ashley Bennett, a freeholder representing Atlantic County who appeared on a 2018 cover of Time magazine with other progressive women, also has announced she is running for the Democratic nomination for the congressional seat.Ms. Bennett has said she intends to focus on issues affecting New Jersey's working class, and is likely to draw support from the state's increasingly active grass-roots organizations.John Francis III, a commissioner in West Cape May, and Robert Turkavage, a former F.B.I. agent who last month switched from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party, have also announced they will run in the Democratic primary.At least three Republicans, including David Richter, a former businessman who has said he will spend $1 million of his own money on his campaign, also are expected to compete against Mr. Van Drew for the Republican nomination.Benjamin A. Dworkin, a professor of political science at Rowan University and the director of the school's Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship, said Ms. Kennedy's entry into the race had the potential to change the playing field.He noted that the Democratic candidates' success at raising campaign funds is likely to be key to the primary race and the general election, especially in southern New Jersey, which is within the pricey Philadelphia media market.Professor Harrison's support from established Democratic Party leaders in the area will presumably help her fund-raising efforts, he said, and the Kennedy family's network of donors is expected to work to Ms. Kennedy's advantage.""There is an established Kennedy fund-raising network that she will be able to tap into and will allow her to be well financed in this race, which really matters,"" Dr. Dworkin said.A candidate's ability to independently generate funds is even more crucial in a year when the national Democratic organization is likely to be focused on protecting the three other congressional seats that the party flipped in 2018 in New Jersey swing districts, he said.""Democrats don't need it as much as they did in 2018,"" Dr. Dworkin said. ""You could lose Van Drew's seat and still maintain the majority, so it's not nearly as critical.""Professor Harrison said she welcomed all opponents.""The more the merrier,"" she said. ""This is healthy for our democracy. Primaries are important. It's a way for parties to flesh out their views.""The Democrat who does win is expected to face a major challenge in November's general election in a conservative district that for 24 years before Mr. Van Drew's election was held by a Republican. Last year, Republicans captured several seats in the State Legislature in an election area that overlaps much of Mr. Van Drew's district.Still, Mr. Trump's support for the Republican candidate is also a wild-card factor that could cut both ways in a state where the president remains deeply unpopular.""This is going to be a very tough race in November,"" Professor Harrison said.PhotographAmy Kennedy, daughter-in-law of former Senator Ted Kennedy.

| Jump to first hitLawmakers aim to pass veto-proof legislation in 2020 that would punish China over its treatment of ethnic Uighur Muslims.WASHINGTON -- In a rare show of bipartisan unity, Republicans and Democrats are planning to try to force President Trump to take a more active stand on human rights in China, preparing veto-proof legislation that would punish top Chinese officials for detaining more than one million Muslims in internment camps.The effort comes amid growing congressional frustration with Mr. Trump's unwillingness to challenge China over human rights abuses, despite vivid news reports this year outlining atrocities, or to confront such issues globally.To press Mr. Trump into action on China, lawmakers plan to move ahead with legislation that would punish Beijing for its repression of ethnic Uighur Muslims, with enough supporters to compel the president to sign or risk being overruled by Congress ahead of the 2020 election. A version of the legislation, known as the Uighur Human Rights Policy Act, passed both the House and Senate this year, but its path to the White House was stalled this month by a procedural process.Human rights causes draw rare bipartisan support in Congress, and many Republican lawmakers have broken from Mr. Trump on the matter, even as they move in lock step with the president on nearly every other issue, including defending him against impeachment.""There's been a sense by some that the administration hasn't prioritized human rights in its broader foreign policy,"" said Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida. ""I don't think that's necessarily accurate -- but that sense has grown. There's been a sense that Congress needs to step up.""Last month, Congress passed legislation by unanimous consent supporting the Hong Kong protests, forcing Mr. Trump to sign the bill. Mr. Trump, who had previously said he was ""standing with"" Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, risked being overruled by Congress and criticized as weak on China if he vetoed the measure. Still, when Mr. Trump signed the bill the night before Thanksgiving, he issued a statement saying he would ""exercise executive discretion"" in enforcing its provisions.Lawmakers this year also passed legislation recognizing the 1915 killings of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians as a genocide over the objections of Mr. Trump. And they approved a resolution calling for the end of American military support of the war in Yemen, in which a Saudi Arabia-led coalition is bombing civilians. Mr. Trump vetoed the measure.In October, after Mr. Trump withdrew American forces just inside Syria's border, paving the way for a Turkish military operation against Kurdish forces, lawmakers voted to rebuke the administration for the decision and show support for the Kurds, a persecuted group in the Middle East that has fought with American troops against the Islamic State.In the coming months, Congress is expected to try to pass legislation that would punish Turkey and Saudi Arabia for human rights abuses, though it is unclear whether those efforts would have a veto-proof majority. The effort includes a package of Turkey sanctions sponsored by Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. The legislation, which would penalize those who commit human rights abuses in Syria, was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in December.Some human rights issues draw greater bipartisan support than others. China hawks have become ascendant across Congress and in the administration, and many Americans increasingly see China as a threat.Although Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have criticized China on the persecution of Muslims, Mr. Trump has said nothing. In July, Jewher Ilham, the daughter of Ilham Tohti, a Uighur professor whom China sentenced to life in prison in 2014, joined other victims of religious persecution to meet with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office. When she tried to explain the camps to Mr. Trump, he appeared ignorant of the situation and simply said, ""That's tough stuff.""""It's hard to find evidence of genuine personal interest,"" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. ""On China, at a minimum, President Trump should stop describing an authoritarian, abusive leader as a 'terrific guy'; doing so gives Chinese authorities the opportunity to choose between that characterization and the far tougher ones offered up by other senior U.S. officials.""Mr. Trump, who has criticized China over its economic practices, has refrained from imposing sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for the camps for fear of jeopardizing the chances of reaching a trade deal. Many top aides and lawmakers from both parties have pushed for sanctions, but the Treasury Department has opposed the penalties. The Uighur act, which had Mr. Rubio and Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey, as sponsors, would compel Mr. Trump to impose sanctions on Chen Quanguo, the top Communist Party official in Xinjiang, where the camps are.In October, the Trump administration placed a few Chinese businesses and security organizations on a commercial blacklist because of their suspected roles in Muslim abuses, but many analysts considered that a weak punishment.Other countries are more complicated. Saudi Arabia has been a traditional American ally, and Iran hawks in Congress, who are generally Republican, argue Riyadh is a regional bulwark against Tehran. And Mr. Trump's positive declarations about President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia have spurred a gradual shift from the anti-Russia views previously held by Republican politicians, conservative voters and right-wing news organizations.Mr. Trump expresses open admiration for many authoritarian leaders, even those condemned by senior officials in his own administration for some of the world's worst atrocities. They include Mr. Xi, Mr. Putin, Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, and President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil.""He's celebrating the leaders who are the worst human rights abusers,"" Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said in an interview. ""It almost seems like the president's support for you is directly proportional to how brutal you are to your citizenry.""This month, the Trump administration blocked a move by members of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the human rights situation in North Korea for the second year in a row. Mr. Trump has expressed warmth for Mr. Kim of North Korea and has engaged in personal diplomacy, meeting him at two summits to try, without success, to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program.""The Trump administration has sent a clear message to Pyongyang and to the rest of the world that this administration doesn't consider starvation, torture, summary executions and a host of other crimes to be a priority,"" said Louis Charbonneau, United Nations director at Human Rights Watch.On other prominent issues this year, Mr. Trump used his executive power to reject measures that would have either punished countries for human rights abuses or simply affirmed the abuses were happening.Mr. Trump vetoed a bipartisan resolution that would have punished Saudi Arabia for its air war in Yemen and the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and permanent resident of the United States. Mr. Khashoggi's death last year -- a grisly killing that American intelligence officials have said was ordered by Prince Mohammed -- reignited a long-simmering effort among a small group of lawmakers to cut off American support for the Saudi-led bombings in Yemen that have helped create the world's worst man-made humanitarian crisis.Four of the six vetoes Mr. Trump has issued in his presidency overturned legislative attempts to penalize the kingdom. In May, Mr. Trump and Mr. Pompeo sparked bipartisan fury by declaring an emergency over Iran that allowed the United States to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan, bypassing a congressional hold on the sales. This fall, in closed door negotiations, the White House blocked similar language from making it into the final version of the annual defense policy bill, a must-pass package of legislation.""I'm a big fan of the president on many fronts, but on this, someone has to stand up,"" Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky and a proponent of withdrawing the United States from wars, said in a floor speech in June before voting to cut off arms sales to the kingdom.In another recent instance that privately confounded Republican lawmakers, the White House recruited multiple Republican senators to block attempts to pass legislation formally recognizing the Armenian genocide. The administration argued the timing of the bill would upend diplomatic relations with Turkey, including when Mr. Trump received Mr. Erdogan at the White House in November. Mr. Trump insisted on holding that meeting over the objections of some Republicans who have criticized Turkey, a NATO ally, for attacking the Kurds in Syria.The legislation finally passed this month, days after the Senate advanced a package of sanctions related to Mr. Erdogan's invasion of northern Syria and his purchase of a sophisticated Russian surface-to-air missile system.PhotographA protest on Sunday in Hong Kong in support of Muslim Uighurs, who face repression and detention in camps under policies set by the central government in Beijing.

| Jump to first hitWe checked misleading statements that President Trump made about his trial, his political enemies and his own record.President Trump celebrated his acquittal by the Senate in meandering remarks made on Thursday, when he recited a familiar litany of falsehoods and misleading assertions about the impeachment trial against him, his political enemies and his own record. Here's a fact check.""A corrupt politician named Adam Schiff made up my statement to the Ukrainian president. He brought it out of thin air. Just made it up.""This is exaggerated. For months, Mr. Trump has decried a re-enactment of his July 25 phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, read aloud by Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.At a hearing in September, Mr. Schiff said he was conferring ""the essence"" of the conversation and later clarified that his summary of the call ""was meant to be at least part in parody."" But he spoke in first person, leaving the impression that he was quoting Mr. Trump.On Thursday, Mr. Trump took particular umbrage at one of Mr. Schiff's erroneous lines in the parody: ""By the way, don't call me again. I'll call you when you've done what I asked."" According to the reconstructed transcript of the call, Mr. Trump said the opposite to Mr. Zelensky: ""Whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call.""But while Mr. Schiff's account at points veered from the transcript in chronology and details, it generally tracked with the transcript's version of what Mr. Trump said on the call (for example, his description of Mr. Zelensky's interest in a meeting and purchasing weapons, and Mr. Trump's asking for a ""favor""). It was not fabricated ""out of thin air.""""They said they didn't add this word. I said, 'Add it, they're probably wrong, but add it.' So now everyone agrees that they were perfectly accurate.""This is exaggerated. Mr. Trump was referring inaccurately to testimony from Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council who heard Mr. Trump's call with Mr. Zelensky. Colonel Vindman said that the reconstructed transcript included a few omissions, and that he had tried to make some changes. Some edits were successful, he said, but two ""substantive"" corrections were not made.On the fourth page of the transcript, Mr. Trump said former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ""went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into that ...""According to his notes, Colonel Vindman said, the ellipses took the place of Mr. Trump saying ""there are recordings.""On that same page, the transcript recorded Mr. Zelensky promising that Ukraine's next prosecutor general would ""look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue.""But Mr. Zelensky explicitly said Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company where Mr. Biden's son worked, and not ""the company,"" according to Colonel Vindman.""I think that's when Comey announced he was leaking, lying and everything else, right?""False. As Mr. Trump praised Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, he claimed that Mr. Grassley's questioning of James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, in May 2017 resulted in Mr. Comey confessing to the misdeeds Mr. Trump has long accused him of. But Mr. Comey had said the exact opposite, denying that he had leaked classified information:Mr. Grassley: ""Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source in news reports about matters relating to the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?""

Mr. Comey: ""Never.""

Mr. Grassley: ""Question two, relatively related, have you ever authorized someone else at the F.B.I. to be an anonymous source in news reports about the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?""

Mr. Comey ""No.""

Mr. Grassley: ""Has any classified information relating to President Trump or his association -- associates been declassified and shared with the media?""

Mr. Comey: ""Not to my knowledge.""""Tell me, why isn't Germany paying money? Why isn't France? Why isn't United Kingdom paying money? Why aren't they paying money? Why are we paying the money?""This is misleading. Mr. Trump was talking about international aid to Ukraine. Those European countries are, in fact, contributing to Ukraine's efforts to counteract Russian aggression. They provide more development and humanitarian aid to Ukraine than the United States does, though the United States is the largest provider of military assistance.European countries have contributed $1.6 billion in development assistance from 2014 to 2017, compared with $807 million from the United States, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.""We just won two seats in North Carolina, two wonderful seats in North Carolina that were not supposed to be won.""This is exaggerated. Two Republicans, Representatives Dan Bishop and Greg Murphy, won their special House elections in September. Contrary to Mr. Trump's claim that his party pulled off upset victories, both districts were conservative strongholds.Republicans have held Mr. Bishop's district, North Carolina's Ninth, since the 1960s. Mr. Murphy won his seat after the February 2019 death of Walter B. Jones Jr., a Republican who had represented the Third District since 1995. Mr. Trump carried both congressional districts by wide margins of 12 percent and 24 percent.""We are putting up walls in New Mexico, too; a state that has never been in play for Republicans is totally in play, right?""This is exaggerated. Mr. Trump has a point that the state has largely voted for Democratic presidential candidates in the past two decades, but he goes too far to say it has ""never been in play for Republicans.""Since New Mexico became a state in 1912, it voted for 15 Democratic presidential candidates and 12 Republican candidates, most recently George W. Bush in 2004. According to the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, the state currently leans Democratic for the 2020 presidential election.""Matt said, like five years ago, six years ago, and I made a speech. And then they do some kind of a straw poll. Who made the best speech? And he said I made the best speech.""False. Mr. Trump was addressing Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, which hosts the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. But he had never won the straw poll at CPAC before he became president.Ron Paul, the libertarian and former Texas congressman, won in 2011, and Mr. Trump, a write-in candidate who received about 1 percent of the votes, did not crack the top 15. Senator Mitt Romney of Utah won in 2012; Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky in 2013, 2014 (Mr. Trump tied for 14th place) and 2015 (Mr. Trump came in eighth place); and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in 2016 (Mr. Trump came in third).CPAC retired the poll for 2017 and 2018, but Mr. Trump did come in first place in 2019 with 82 percent of the votes, with Mr. Romney trailing in second at 6 percent.""We had first time in 51 years where drug prices actually came down last year, first time in 51 years.""This is misleading. The Consumer Price Index for prescription drugs has declined under Mr. Trump, most recently in September. But that measure does not include all prescription drugs. Nor was it the ""first time in 51 years"" that the index had declined -- it did so as well in December 2013, under the Obama administration. And it has risen since September.Other analyses show that drug prices have continued to rise, albeit at a slower rate than in the past. GoodRx, a website that tracks costs, has found that 639 drugs have so far increased by an average of 6 percent. That's in line with other surveys from 3 Axis Advisors, a consultancy firm that estimated an average rise of 5.3 percent this year, and Rx Savings Solutions, a company that advises employers on how to reduce drug costs, which found an average 6.9 percent increase on more than 2,500 drugs.Curious about the accuracy of a claim?

| Jump to first hitThe lawsuit concerns two opinion articles that tied the 2016 Trump election campaign to Russia. A week ago, the campaign filed a similar action against The New York Times.President Trump's re-election campaign sued The Washington Post for libel on Tuesday, citing two opinion articles from last year that linked Mr. Trump to Russian election interference. The action came a week after Mr. Trump's campaign filed a similar lawsuit against The New York Times.Mr. Trump's attacks on news organizations have been a defining mark of his presidency, and The Post has been one of his frequent targets. In 2017, the newspaper won a Pulitzer Prize for a series of articles by David Farenthold that examined Mr. Trump's philanthropic claims. The president has often belittled The Post and its owner, Jeff Bezos, the billionaire Amazon founder, who bought it in 2013.The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington, centers on two opinion articles from a Post blog called The Plum Line that accused the 2016 Trump election campaign of inviting help from foreign governments. The Post's opinion section operates separately from its newsroom.In one post, published on June 13, Greg Sargent wrote that Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, had ""concluded that Trump and/or his campaign eagerly encouraged, tried to conspire with, and happily profited off"" Russia's efforts.In a post on June 20, Paul Waldman wrote: ""Who knows what sort of aid Russia and North Korea will give to the Trump campaign, now that he has invited them to offer their assistance?"" The word ""invited"" in the article was hyperlinked to a transcript of an ABC News interview with Mr. Trump, in which he said he would consider accepting information from a foreign government about a political opponent.The Trump campaign accused The Post of making ""false and defamatory"" statements.""There has never been any statement by anyone associated with the campaign or the administration 'inviting' Russia or North Korea to assist the campaign in 2019 or beyond,"" the court filing said. ""There also has never been any reporting that the campaign has ever had any contact with North Korea relating to any United States election.""A spokeswoman for The Post, Kristine Coratti Kelly, said on Tuesday, ""It's disappointing to see the president's campaign committee resorting to these types of tactics, and we will vigorously defend this case.""Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer at Gibson Dunn who has previously worked on high-profile media cases, said the lawsuit ""flies in the face of basic First Amendment doctrine.""""The complaint is attacking opinions where the authors are expressing their views based on widely reported facts,"" he said. ""It's all part of the overarching war on the press.""Mr. Trump's re-election campaign sued The Times on Feb. 26, claiming that an essay published in the newspaper's Opinion section last March falsely asserted a ""quid pro quo"" between Russian officials and Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign. (Like The Post, The Times's Opinion section is separate from its newsroom.)In both lawsuits, the campaign is represented by Charles J. Harder, a lawyer who has worked on a number of legal battles with news organizations.Mr. Harder is best known for representing Terry G. Bollea, the former professional wrestler known as Hulk Hogan, in a lawsuit that decimated Gawker Media and was secretly underwritten by the tech investor Peter Thiel.He also represented Melania Trump, Mr. Trump's wife, when she sued The Daily Mail, a British tabloid, in 2016 over its report that a modeling agency she had worked for in the 1990s was also an escort service. The Daily Mail later retracted the article and paid damages in a settlement.PhotographA lawsuit filed against The Washington Post, a frequent target of President Trump, centers on two opinion articles.

| Jump to first hitSenator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, explained why he would cast a pivotal vote against having witnesses at President Trump's impeachment trial, ensuring a quick acquittal.WASHINGTON -- As he weighed the evidence against President Trump, Senator Lamar Alexander reached an unavoidable conclusion: Mr. Trump had done what he was accused of, pressuring a foreign power to investigate his political rival. But however inappropriate his conduct, another conviction overrode the first: Americans would not tolerate the Senate stepping in to substitute its own judgment for that of the voters fewer than 10 months before the next election.""The Senate reflects the country, and the country is as divided as it has been for a long time,"" Mr. Alexander said Friday during an interview in his Capitol office. ""For the Senate to tear up the ballots in this election and say President Trump couldn't be on it, the country probably wouldn't accept that. It would just pour gasoline on cultural fires that are burning out there.""With that logic, Mr. Alexander delivered a victory to Mr. Trump -- and to Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, with whom Mr. Alexander has been friends for more than a half-century. In announcing he would vote to block witnesses at Mr. Trump's impeachment trial, he set Mr. Trump on a quick course to his inevitable acquittal.Many Republicans appeared to be following Mr. Alexander's lead on Friday, saying the Tennessee senator had echoed the feelings of their caucus -- and the country.""Long story short, @SenatorAlexander most likely expressed the sentiments of the country as a whole as well as any single Senator possibly could,"" Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a close ally of Mr. Trump's, wrote on Twitter. ""Those who hate Trump and wish to take the voters choice away in an unfounded manner, Sen. Alexander rightly rejected their arguments.""Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, put it this way: ""Lamar speaks for lots and lots of us.""Mr. Alexander could easily have gone the other way. He is retiring from the Senate and free to vote as he pleases without political consequences. And he said in the interview that Mr. Trump had done exactly what Democrats had accused him of doing: He withheld military aid from Ukraine to pressure the country to investigate his political rival -- a move he could not condone.""I think he did something that was clearly inappropriate,"" Mr. Alexander said. ""I think it is inappropriate for the president to ask the leader of a foreign nation to investigate a leading political rival, which the president says he did. I think it is inappropriate at least in part to withhold aid to encourage that investigation.""""But that is not treason, that is not bribery, that is not a high crime and misdemeanor,"" he added, listing the criteria enumerated in the Constitution for impeachable offenses.It is hardly a surprise that Mr. Alexander is effectively coming down on both sides. Widely respected as a Senate ""institutionalist"" -- a guardian of its traditions -- he is a product of a bygone time in Republican politics: the pre-Trump era, when lawmakers worked across the political aisle to forge consensus on matters of national importance.A former governor, university president and secretary of education, Mr. Alexander has modeled himself on Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., another Tennessee Republican, who turned against President Richard M. Nixon during Watergate. Mr. Baker, who died in 2014, introduced Mr. Alexander to Mr. McConnell in 1969, when Mr. Alexander was an aide in the Nixon White House and Mr. McConnell was a legislative assistant to a Kentucky senator.Few friendships in the Capitol have been as enduring as theirs. Today Mr. McConnell calls Mr. Alexander ""my best friend in the Senate."" But Mr. Alexander said he did not give Mr. McConnell -- whom he described, aptly, as ""a person of few words"" -- advance notice of his vote.""I know what he thinks, and he knows that is not the way to influence my decisions,"" Mr. Alexander said.Yet Mr. McConnell did not really have to ask. Although Mr. Alexander was lumped in with three other Republicans -- Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah -- who had expressed openness to witnesses, it was clear early on that he was unlikely to vote to include them.Those close to him say he does not relish shaking things up.""I think that Lamar has been able to successfully navigate the ins and outs of the new administration because Lamar is very wise in how he shares, when he shares, any disagreement or policy difference he might have with the administration,"" said Tom Griscom, a close friend of Mr. Alexander's who worked as Mr. Baker's press secretary. ""He's not looking to be out on the front edge of it.""Another close friend, Tom Ingram, who ran Mr. Alexander's Senate races and served as his chief of staff, said he was not surprised by Mr. Alexander's decision. He said Mr. Alexander was troubled by what he regarded as a highly partisan impeachment process in the House, and wanted to assure that the Senate gave it thorough consideration, which was why he had expressed openness to witnesses.""Knowing the reverence he holds for the presidency -- the office, not the person -- and for the Senate process and how seriously he takes impeachment, it was going to have to be very clear in his mind that the offense clearly fit the high bar set in the Constitution.""With 47 Democratic votes (including those of two independents who caucus with them), Senate Democrats would need four Republicans to cross party lines in order to force the Senate to subpoena witnesses and fresh documents. In the end, it appears, they will fall short by two. Ms. Collins and Mr. Romney have said they will vote in favor of witnesses.A little more than 12 hours after Mr. Alexander had declared his intentions, Ms. Murkowski said Friday that she, too, would vote against.""Given the partisan nature of this impeachment from the very beginning and throughout, I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate,"" she said in a statement. ""I don't believe the continuation of this process will change anything.""""It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed,"" Ms. Murkowski added.Unlike Mr. Alexander, she did not pass judgment on Mr. Trump's behavior. Mr. Alexander's decision to do so gave Democrats a boost.""He came to the wrong conclusions about hearing evidence in this trial, that's clear,"" Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, told reporters on Friday. ""But Senator Alexander, a senior Senate Republican, a retiring member, said out loud what I think most Senate Republicans believe in private: That yes, the president did withhold military assistance to try to get Ukraine to help with his election.""Even so, Mr. Alexander told NPR that he supported Mr. Trump's re-election.In the interview with The New York Times, he said voters should take the charges against Mr. Trump into account, but offered a pointed contrast between the president and his would-be Democratic challengers, specifically mentioning Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, an icon of the progressive left who is a leading contender in her party's nominating contest.""Whatever you think of his behavior,"" Mr. Alexander said of Mr. Trump, ""with the terrific economy, with conservative judges, with fewer regulations, you add in there an inappropriate call with the president of Ukraine, and you decide if you prefer him or Elizabeth Warren.""PhotographConvicting the president ""would just pour gasoline on cultural fires that are burning out there,"" said Senator Lamar Alexander, center.

| Jump to first hitThe recording of a dinner President Trump held with big-dollar donors in 2018 demonstrates just how alive and well special-interest access and influence remains in Washington.WASHINGTON -- It became such a central slogan of Donald J. Trump's 2016 campaign that at rallies his supporters would chant the three words representing his pledge to take on big donors and special interests: ""Drain the swamp.""But as President Trump ramps up his 2020 re-election bid, it is clear that he has tolerated if not fostered a swamp of his own in Washington, granting up-close access to deep-pocketed supporters and interest groups willing to write six- and seven-figure checks to his political operation. Some have used the opportunity to plead their cases directly to him.The latest evidence came over the weekend, with the release of a secret recording of an April 2018 dinner for major donors and prospective donors to a super PAC supporting Mr. Trump.While news of the recording primarily focused on Mr. Trump's call for the removal of Marie L. Yovanovitch as ambassador to Ukraine after a donor claimed she had disparaged the president, the recording revealed that Mr. Trump engaged in policy discussions with many other donors pushing their own agendas.There was the New York real estate developer whose company's project in South Korea was proposed to Mr. Trump as a possible site for his summit with Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea.There was the Canadian steel magnate who pushed the president to further limit steel imports to the United States, and whose companies donated $1.75 million to the super PAC.Other attendees discussed government policies that could benefit their businesses, including building a highway for self-driving trucks and regulations that would help make trucks powered by gas compressors to be more competitive with electric-powered vehicles.The recording is a glimpse into a broader pattern in which the administration appointed industry lobbyists to key policymaking jobs, heeded the deregulatory wishes of big corporations and granted regular access to donors and influential political supporters. Some of the policies sought by the donors at the 2018 dinner have been subsequently introduced in Congress; it is unclear in those cases whether the president or the White House intervened.In other cases, Mr. Trump has directly championed the businesses of some of his biggest donors, as he did in the weeks after his inauguration when he reportedly discussed with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan an effort by the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson to build a casino there.Mr. Trump's assiduous courtship of major donors closely mirrors behavior for which he chastised his opponents in 2016, when he cast himself as a billionaire whose ability to finance his own campaign would ensure that he was not beholden to financial backers.In the months after starting his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump branded his Republican rivals, as well as his eventual Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, as ""puppets"" of major donors who funded their campaigns and supportive super PACs.In one characteristic broadside at his rivals in late 2015, he assailed Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, and Senator Marco Rubio, also of Florida, both of whom were seeking the Republican nomination at the time, for their embrace of super PACs funded by major donors.""And you look at Hillary -- let's go to the other side -- they have super PACs, where they control the candidate just like you control a puppet,"" Mr. Trump said. ""We don't want anybody to form super PACs for me. We sent legal notices: 'Please give all the money back.' We don't want it.""It was not long before Mr. Trump reversed himself.His campaign began aggressively courting donations to supplement the personal money he was spending on his 2016 bid, and his team eventually blessed the formation of a super PAC that solicited large checks from major donors to air ads attacking Mrs. Clinton.Once elected, Mr. Trump's team signaled that he did not intend to spend his own money on his re-election. His allies formed a pair of political groups using variations of the name America First that could accept unlimited donations. He began appearing at events for donors, the most generous of whom were invited to the White House for briefings with top administration officials.He has attended many donor gatherings and fund-raisers have been held at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, including the dinner that was the subject of the recording released over the weekend. Held in a private suite on April 30, 2018, it was for donors and prospective donors to America First Action, a super PAC that has raised nearly $50 million to support Mr. Trump and allied candidates.The recording, which includes video at times, shows Mr. Trump entering the suite and posing for some photographs before joining donors in a dining room with 16 plush chairs around an ornately set table accented with floral arrangements.Mr. Trump updated the donors on some of the most pressing issues facing his administration, including its ongoing negotiations with China over trade and North Korea over nuclear weapons. He seemed to encourage the donors to share their concerns.Mr. Trump mentioned to the donors that his administration had selected a date and a location for his first meeting with Mr. Kim, which would be held in Singapore in the weeks after the dinner. One of the dinner attendees suggested a different site for the summit: a so-called smart development outside Seoul, South Korea, called Songdo, featuring a convention center, apartments and a golf course designed by the golfer Jack Nicklaus.A leading stakeholder in the development was a company run by Stanley C. Gale, a donor to Republican campaigns and committees who attended the dinner, according to people familiar with the event. It was also attended by the golfer's grandson and namesake, Jack Nicklaus III, who works for Mr. Gale's company, according to a LinkedIn profile. Mr. Gale did not respond to a request for comment.During the discussion, Mr. Trump told the guests, ""You know that Kim Jong-un is a great golfer."" His remark prompted laughter and led another guest to suggest that Mr. Kim's scores were recorded as all holes-in-one in his authoritarian country.Another guest was Barry Zekelman, a Canadian citizen who owned a United States-based steel-tube manufacturing company that donated $1.75 million to America First Action, avoiding running afoul of a ban on foreign donations in American politics. He used the dinner to push the president on two challenges facing his company: cheap steel tube imports from Asia and new federal rules that made it harder to find truck drivers.He urged Mr. Trump to go further in his effort to limit steel imports to the United States and questioned the rules intended to prevent fatal truck accidents by using electronic monitoring systems to limit the hours drivers could be on the road.""Say someone is half an hour from home on their long-haul truck -- they literally have to pull over on the side of the road and stop,"" Mr. Zekelman said. ""They can't go home.""Mr. Trump did not seem to be aware of the new federal rules that required those monitoring systems.""They have a method that you shut down a truck?"" Mr. Trump said, after Mr. Zekelman questioned the effect the new rules had on his ability to move the steel pipe he manufactured. ""Wow.""Since that dinner, legislation has been introduced in the House with the cosponsorship of 12 Republicans, including the brother of Vice President Mike Pence, to allow smaller trucking companies to get exemptions from the rule.Legislation has also been introduced to help natural gas vehicles compete with electric ones. It was applauded by an Ohio company that makes gas compressors, Ariel Corporation. One of its executives, Thomas Rastin, was on the invitation list for the April dinner. He and a woman resembling his wife, Karen Buchwald Wright, who owns Ariel Corporation, are briefly visible in the video of the event. Together, the couple have donated a combined $875,000 to America First Action. He did not respond to questions about whether he was the voice on the recording urging the president to take steps to help the industry.Another invitee was Wayne Hoovestol, who owns trucking companies in the Midwest, including one that works with the United States Postal Service. On the recording, a male voice says he runs a company that does business with the Postal Service and urges Mr. Trump to consider supporting the construction of a 500-mile section of highway to be used exclusively by self-driving trucks.Paying truck drivers, the voice said, was one of his company's biggest costs.""All the technology is there, right now,"" he said. ""It is absolutely safe.""A limited liability company that shared an address and personnel with one of Mr. Hoovestol's companies donated $250,000 to America First Action on the day of the dinner.Mr. Hoovestol did not respond to a request for comment.The recording was made by a dinner attendee, Igor Fruman, and was released by the lawyer for another, Lev Parnas, an associate of Mr. Fruman.The two, both Soviet-born American businessmen, would go on to play central roles in the pressure campaign against Ukraine that led to Mr. Trump's impeachment.During the dinner, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman discussed with Mr. Trump a natural gas venture they were pursuing in Ukraine. Mr. Parnas also asked the president to consider changing banking regulations to aid another business venture they would soon pursue: a plan to win marijuana retail licenses in Nevada and elsewhere.The month after the dinner, they donated $325,000 to America First Action through Global Energy Producers, a company they had recently formed to pursue energy deals.The men have since been indicted on campaign finance charges related to their business ventures and have pleaded not guilty.Ben Protess contributed reporting from New York.PhotographPresident Trump speaking to a group of mayors at the White House on Friday.

| Jump to first hitA desire not to offend potential customers in a divided nation, as well as wariness of President Trump's Twitter account, means fewer topical ads.At this point in the 2016 election cycle Donald J. Trump was slashing through a field of more seasoned candidates and Hillary Clinton appeared to have a good shot at becoming the first female president. Americans were transfixed, and a number of advertising campaigns capitalized on the growing interest in an unusual race.A Chrysler commercial starred a pair of actors known for their portrayals of fictional White House occupants: Martin Sheen (President Jed Bartlet of ""The West Wing"") and Bill Pullman (President Thomas Whitmore of ""Independence Day"").An ad for Legal Sea Foods, a restaurant chain based in Boston, presented the company's chief executive, Roger Berkowitz, in a mock campaign poster with a slogan that referenced a Trump campaign promise: ""If we build a wall on the border, who will eat our delicious fish tacos?""Four years later, things have changed. The environment for advertising is ""more scary than exciting,"" said Ellis Verdi, the president of DeVito/Verdi, the agency that created the Legal Sea Foods ad, and most companies no longer see an upside in weighing in on politics, even jokingly.""There's fear, as opposed to the entertainment that was associated with the horse race a couple of years ago,"" Mr. Verdi said. ""Even free expression is a challenge right now. People are holding their hands over their eyes and ears a little bit. This is not the moment for advertisers to take risks.""With impeachment in the news and the 2020 campaign sparking nasty hashtags on social media, it has become routine for companies to reject pitches for ads that even touch on politics. They have also asked that their ads be placed far from candidates' campaign spots.""It's like McCarthyism -- people are too frickin' scared to say anything,"" said Gaston Legorburu, a longtime advertising executive who founded the agency Glue IQ. ""I've seen briefs where on Page 1 they're telling you to, by all means, stay away from anything that is political.""In the digital sphere, companies are taking steps to make sure that their ads do not appear next to content that includes keywords like ""Russia,"" ""Ukraine"" and ""election,"" according to data compiled by the technology company Integral Ad Science.""Impeachment"" is another no-no. In December 2018, few companies blocked that word. A year later, nearly 50 companies had done so.Some brand executives have told ad agencies that they are afraid of alienating customers or drawing the wrath of the presidential Twitter account.""It's a divided world that we live in,"" said Raja Rajamannar, the chief marketing officer at Mastercard. ""Can you afford to exclude half of your audience?""Other companies are avoiding politically engaged ads out of simple fatigue.""Trump has been in America's 24-hour news cycle for the past four years: countless hours of 'Saturday Night Live' skits, tweets, memes, #resistance microsites, etc.,"" Zachary Roif, an associate creative director at the marketing agency R/GA, said in an email. ""People have simply had enough -- enough outrage, enough disdain, enough shock value to the point where making a statement feels a little tired.""And then there is the risk of offending Mr. Trump and how that could affect business.""This notion that you pick on a president and then he tweets about you and is mean to your company is a new thing,"" said Eamonn Store, the chief executive of the consulting firm FairShare and a former North American chief executive of Guardian News & Media. ""If you happen to be a large technology brand like Microsoft, and the government is your biggest client, then the last thing you need is to be in conflict with the White House.""Many companies, Mr. Store added, believe Mr. Trump will win re-election. If that happens, he said, ""being the pro-impeachment enterprise is not going to be good for business.""The president has railed against Amazon, Google and Harley-Davidson. When Nike announced in 2018 that it had entered into a new marketing deal with the former N.F.L. quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had angered the administration by kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racism, Mr. Trump said on Twitter, ""Nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts.""Things are different on the other side of the Atlantic. Before the fractious general election in Britain last month, Burger King put up an ad on the sides of a double-decker bus featuring a photo of a burger and the tagline ""Another Whopper on the side of a bus. Must be an election."" The British supermarket chain Tesco commented cheekily on the political discord with an advertisement showing bottles of liquor crowded around the words ""Time for a cabinet reshuffle.""This is the kind of advertising -- politically engaged, cheerfully flippant -- that is not making the rounds in the United States.In recent years companies have been willing to associate themselves with broad messages on social issues, using ads to support female empowerment, the environment and other causes that do not raise many hackles. But the specifics of 2020 seem too hot to touch.""It just feels wrong right now,"" Mr. Verdi said.PhotographPolitically themed ads were common in the last election cycle, as in a Chrysler commercial starring Martin Sheen, above center, and Bill Pullman, but the mood has changed since President Trump's election.

| Jump to first hitBut his speech had the surreal quality of a president on trial for high crimes and misdemeanors addressing lawmakers in the chamber where he was impeached just seven weeks ago.WASHINGTON -- The defendant finally showed up to have his say. President Trump never uttered the word impeachment, but in a 78-minute speech to the nation that combined a celebration of the American economy, hard-edge policy pronouncements and reality show-style surprises for the audience, he made the case for his presidency as only he could.It was not a case that persuaded Democrats, who remained seated stonily during the applause lines, shaking their heads and rolling their eyes, but it was not meant to. Assured of acquittal in the Senate trial on Wednesday, Mr. Trump moved past preserving his first term and focused on securing a second with an argument aimed at both his political base and dubious suburban voters.It had a surreal quality, a president on trial for high crimes and misdemeanors addressing lawmakers in the same House chamber where he was impeached just seven weeks ago. While Mr. Trump resisted the impulse to show up at the Senate trial to reject the charges against him over the last couple of weeks, he used his State of the Union address to present a different sort of defense without the burden of cross-examination, in effect arguing that the ""great American comeback"" he claimed credit for outweighed the allegations against him.If Democrats were unmoved, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi ostentatiously ripped up her copy of his speech once it was done, making sure the cameras would catch the moment, Republicans embraced the president many of them once scorned. They welcomed him with hearty applause and even chanted, ""Four more years! Four more years!"" as if it were a campaign rally rather than an affair of state.On its surface, the speech presented an optimistic assessment of the country and its progress, perhaps reflecting his sense of his own. ""America's enemies are on the run, America's fortunes are on the rise, and America's future is blazing bright,"" Mr. Trump said.But he also laid out a darker view of an America still plagued by ""criminal aliens,"" terrorized by Islamic radicals and threatened by budding socialists eager to take over the health care system.Throughout his time in the chamber, the president seemed sullen, even gloomy, barely cracking a smile and making no attempts at humor. He refused to shake Ms. Pelosi's hand when he handed her his speech and she refused to say it was a ""distinct honor"" to present him when she announced him, both abandoning custom.All around Mr. Trump were reminders of his ordeal over the last several months. One of the members of the escort committee that brought him in, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, is part of the team of House Democrats prosecuting him. The president encountered Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who is presiding over the Senate trial and seemed intent on maintaining a studious neutral expression during their brief exchange.While he made no mention of impeachment, Mr. Trump did single out Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader who has single-handedly ensured he would survive the trial without witnesses testifying against him. ""Thank you, Mitch,"" Mr. Trump said at one point, referring to the senator's help confirming judges, but it would not be surprising if he were grateful for other reasons.The president's grim mood belied what was otherwise a good day for him. Aside from his coming acquittal and the chance to address the largest television audience of the year uninterrupted, Mr. Trump earlier in the day reveled in the Democratic dysfunction in the Iowa caucus and avidly sought to exploit it to promote suspicion among his rivals.He and his sons and allies pumped out Twitter messages suggesting the botched Iowa count was an effort to rig the election for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and against Senator Bernie Sanders, the candidate the president would rather face in the fall.""It's a fiasco that just plays right into us,"" the president told television network anchors during an off-the-record lunch earlier in the day, according to people in the room.""What other people would look at as a moment of completely political meltdown for this president, it all appears to accrue to his benefit,"" said Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union. ""He actually looks like the adult in the room.""Democrats acknowledged that the Iowa breakdown played to Mr. Trump's advantage, at least in the short term.""A fractious, divisive, and chaotic process inevitably takes focus away from Trump's own failures, at least in the short term, and Trump obviously believes he has the opportunity to stir the pot against the Democrats in these circumstances,"" said Geoff Garin, a prominent Democratic pollster. ""All of this heightens the importance for Democrats to have a confident and united front as soon as possible.""The Iowa debacle played out even as Gallup reported that Mr. Trump's approval rating had climbed to 49 percent, its highest in that survey since his presidency began. While not a strong number historically, it is higher than either Barack Obama or Bill Clinton had going into their State of the Union speeches in the years they ultimately won re-election, though not as high as George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan had in theirs.Not that he can necessarily count on any of this to last. The economy, while healthy, has slowed its growth and could take a hit from the China travel restrictions imposed to fight the coronavirus outbreak. At some point, the Democrats will anoint a nominee who could unify the party against Mr. Trump. And John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, plans to publish a book next month that is expected to offer revelations about the president's use of his office to further his own political interests.Mr. Trump has shown a remarkable capacity for crossing lines and creating political problems for himself just when things appear to be better for him. Indeed, he placed the phone call to Ukraine's president that got him impeached the day after testimony by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III made clear that he was out of political jeopardy as a result of the Russia investigation.But for one night, at least, the president had the stage to himself and he made the most of it. With a mix of schmaltz and showmanship, he pulled one surprise after another on the audience.At one point, he introduced Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio host who just announced that he has advanced lung cancer, and seemed to stun the broadcaster by announcing that he would bestow on him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Rather than wait, the president then had Melania Trump pull the medal out and drape it around Mr. Limbaugh's neck right there in the first lady's box, surely the first time that has happened at a State of the Union address.In another uplifting moment, he gave a scholarship to a fourth-grade girl also sitting in the box. At the same time, he introduced a variety of figures with tragic stories, the parents of a woman killed by the Islamic State, the widow and son of a soldier killed in Iraq, the brother of a man shot by an undocumented immigrant.But he saved the most tear-jerking moment for the end, when he thanked the wife of an Army soldier deployed to Afghanistan -- then announced that her husband in fact had returned to the country, as the soldier suddenly appeared in the box to her great surprise.The president's address took place just across the Capitol and hours after senators took to the floor to announce their vote in his trial -- Republicans steadfastly pledging to acquit, Democrats resolutely vowing to convict, the two-thirds required by the Constitution for removal clearly nowhere in sight.Chief Justice Roberts, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Jeffries and the rest will return to the Senate chamber at 4 p.m. on Wednesday to tally those votes, inevitable as they now seem, and to wrap up the third presidential impeachment trial in American history.Mr. Trump presumably will not show up in person. But he told the anchors in their lunch that he wanted to make a speech after the vote, another kind of speech, not so much a state of the union but a valedictory after months of battle -- in his view, a comeback of a different sort.Maggie Haberman and Annie Karni contributed reporting from Washington, and Michael M. Grynbaum from New York.PhotographPresident Trump entering the House chamber to deliver the State of the Union on Tuesday. He address ran for 78 minutes and included reality show-style surprises.

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump's former campaign manager, Mr. Lewandowski, had been weighing a bid but said he would focus on Mr. Trump's re-election instead.Corey Lewandowski, the polarizing political operative who was President Trump's first 2016 campaign manager, said Tuesday that he would not seek a United States Senate seat in New Hampshire, ending months of speculation about a run that had put some Republican state leaders on edge.Mr. Lewandowski, who faced the prospect of a grueling primary race and a tough general election matchup against the Democratic incumbent, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, made his announcement in a series of tweets. He wrote that he was ""certain"" that he would have won, but had instead decided to focus on ensuring that Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020.""I am truly humbled by the outpouring of support I have received from people across New Hampshire and the country,"" he said, adding that he would endorse a Republican candidate ""in the near future.""A bid by Mr. Lewandowski would have had support from key parts of Mr. Trump's political apparatus in a rare race where Republicans would have a chance to pick up a Senate seat in 2020. It would also have tested the appetite for Trumpism in a purple state with a Republican governor where Hillary Clinton very narrowly won in 2016 and Ms. Shaheen won her Senate race two years earlier by less than three percentage points.At least three Republicans are already in the contest: William O'Brien, a former speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives; Donald Bolduc, a retired Army brigadier general; and Corky Messner, a businessman and veteran.In August, Mr. Trump all but endorsed Mr. Lewandowski in an interview with a New Hampshire radio host. ""I will say this -- if he ran, he would be a great senator. If he ran and won, he'd be a great senator,"" Mr. Trump said in the interview.Mr. Lewandowski helped Mr. Trump notch his first primary victory in New Hampshire in February 2016, which began Mr. Trump's march to the Republican presidential nomination. Mr. Trump's children fired Mr. Lewandowski as the campaign manager less than five months later, but the president would retain a fondness for him and would speak with him often.If he had run in New Hampshire, Mr. Lewandowski's business activities would have been the subject of intense scrutiny. While Mr. Trump has been in office, Mr. Lewandowski has been an adviser to companies that have interests with the government.In May 2017, Mr. Lewandowski left the lobbying firm he helped start, Avenue Strategies, amid questions about whether he was lobbying without having registered. Since then, Mr. Lewandowski has had private clients and for many months gave paid speeches to various groups. Mr. Lewandowski has previously said that he was not a lobbyist, and that he had never called government officials on behalf of a client.Nonetheless, some Republicans, both in New Hampshire and in Washington, had expressed skepticism about whether Mr. Lewandowski would ultimately enter the Senate race, in part because doing so would have forced him to file financial disclosure forms that would have provided additional details about his work.Mr. Lewandowski has also faced allegations of assault: In 2016, during the campaign, he was accused of grabbing a reporter for Breitbart News who was trying to ask Mr. Trump questions. Mr. Lewandowski was charged with simple battery by the police in Jupiter, Fla.; the charges were later dropped. The following year, a pop singer accused Mr. Lewandowski of slapping her twice on the buttocks at a party in Washington.In a statement on Tuesday, a spokesman for the New Hampshire Democratic Party sought to tie Republicans to Mr. Lewandowski and Mr. Trump even without Mr. Lewandowski in the race.""Every Republican running for Senate in New Hampshire has stood proudly with Corey Lewandowski and Donald Trump in their efforts to take away health care from tens of thousands of Granite Staters and reverse Roe v. Wade,"" said the spokesman, Josh Marcus-Blank. ""While Messner, Bolduc and O'Brien tear each other down in the contentious primary Lewandowski has left behind, Senator Shaheen will continue working across the aisle for New Hampshire, leading efforts to lower prescription drug costs and making sure veterans and their families get the benefits they deserve.""Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.PhotographCorey Lewandowski was President Trump's first campaign manager in 2016.

| Jump to first hitThe transformation of Pete Hegseth -- an Ivy League-educated, decorated Army platoon leader -- is a symbol of the Republican Party in the Trump era.WASHINGTON -- Immediately after President Trump ordered the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani of Iran, some of the loudest applause was heard from Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host and a decorated veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.""He's a terrorist who has killed Americans. We knew where he was and the president took a bold move to get rid of him, and people around the globe are thankful for that,"" Mr. Hegseth said on the set of ""Fox & Friends,"" a perch he often takes to validate -- and at times influence -- Mr. Trump's military policies.That was the same Mr. Hegseth who has defended the president's cozy interactions with Kim Jong-un, embraced Mr. Trump's ""America first"" agenda of withdrawing forces abroad -- and reversing interventionist policies he labeled irresolute and shameful -- and energetically taken up the cause of combat veterans accused of war crimes.But at no point during Mr. Trump's presidency has Mr. Hegseth loomed larger, with the United States on a war footing and the next step unknown. Among the president's unofficial policy advisers and those who add to the echo chamber on Fox News talk shows, no one else channels Mr. Trump's mix of avowed isolationism, impulsive interventionism and unexpected resort to force.""If I was part of shaping the narrative"" concerning the strike on General Suleimani, Mr. Hegseth said in a telephone interview on Monday, ""well, that's a wonderful part of my day job.""Mr. Hegseth's views, which have greatly evolved since his time in the Army and his tenure leading two conservative veterans organizations, are emblematic of the seismic shift among many Republicans under Mr. Trump on long-held foreign policy positions. They also reflect a slow but significant souring among veterans on the post-9/11 conflicts that many believe have cost the nation too much in lives and money.""I think a lot of us who were very hawkish and believe in American military might and strength were very resistant to how candidate Trump characterized the wars,"" Mr. Hegseth said in another recent telephone interview. ""But if we are honest with ourselves, there is no doubt that we need to radically reorient how we do it. How much money have we invested, how many lives have we invested and has it actually made us safer? Is it still worth it?""Mr. Hegseth's influence was most pronounced late last year when he lobbied heavily on behalf of Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, a member of the Navy SEALs who was acquitted of serious war crimes. Mr. Trump reversed a demotion ordered as punishment, and then fired the secretary of the Navy, whom Mr. Hegseth had aggressively criticized.Mr. Hegseth took to Fox News in November to defend Chief Gallagher. ""From the beginning, this was overzealous prosecutors who were not giving the benefit of the doubt to the trigger pullers,"" he said.He spoke to Mr. Trump several times about the case. Mr. Trump subsequently tagged Mr. Hegseth in tweets on the issue, a public confirmation of his interactions with the president.Having been successful in the Gallagher case, Mr. Hegseth has now taken up the cause of winning pardons for the Blackwater security contractors who were found guilty in the 2007 shooting of dozens of unarmed Iraqis in Baghdad.Mr. Hegseth's shift has alienated some longtime allies.""I respect his service,"" said William Kristol, a conservative analyst and former mentor to Mr. Hegseth. ""I knew him 10 years ago and hoped he would be one of many leaders of that generation for strong American policy. But he has now apologized for war crimes and is a demagogue for Trump.""Mr. Hegseth's rallying around Mr. Trump's order to attack General Suleimani has turned off some opponents of the ""forever wars"" who see opportunism. Voices like Tucker Carlson, another Fox host who has become strongly antiwar, and Concerned Veterans for America, a conservative group that Mr. Hegseth once led, have remained true to their war fatigue. Not Mr. Hegseth.""I have been debating Pete Hegseth for 12 years, and I can't tell you what he stands for other than himself and his own ambition,"" said Jon Soltz, who served as an Army officer in the Iraq war and is a founder of VoteVets, a liberal group that advocates for veterans.In 2009, Mr. Hegseth defended the surge in Afghanistan in repeated debates with Mr. Soltz, who was a critic of President Barack Obama and warned at the time that Iran was becoming empowered in Iraq.""I don't share the concern that President Trump is dragging us into endless war here,"" Mr. Hegseth said. ""In fact, I hate the term 'endless war' as it pertains to Iran.""The transformation of Mr. Hegseth -- an Ivy League-educated, decorated Army platoon leader and former ally of Senator John McCain -- from fierce advocate of militarism abroad to passionate Trumpist trumpet is a symbol of the Republican Party in the Trump era.Scores of buttoned-up, Russia-deploring free traders with a deep reserve of tolerance for military involvements abroad have cast aside core beliefs to embrace Mr. Trump, their new personas validated and amplified by the heavily groomed, assembled supporters on the Fox set, where Mr. Hegseth now sits.He has scored the rare dual posts of cable star and unofficial Trump adviser; Mr. Trump considered him for the jobs of White House press secretary and secretary of veterans affairs.Mr. Hegseth, a Minnesota native, graduated from Princeton University, where he was the publisher of The Princeton Tory, a conservative magazine for which he wrote about seeing the statue of Saddam Hussein toppled in Baghdad. ""Conservative ideas have worked, do work and will continue to work,"" he concluded. ""The list is long: A strong military is absolutely essential to bringing long-term peace and stability to the world.""After earning his Army commission via Princeton's Reserve Officers Training Corps, he served with a National Guard unit guarding detainees at Guantánamo Bay in 2004 and 2005.""He was a highly disciplined, highly focused, very intelligent officer and soldier who was really committed to serving his country,"" said Ziad Shehady, who served with Mr. Hegseth.In 2005, Mr. Hegseth volunteered to deploy to Iraq and was assigned to the Third Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division. There, Mr. Hegseth served under Col. Michael D. Steele, a hard-charging Army Ranger officer who was part of the Black Hawk Down episode in Somalia, a leader devoted to aggressive tactics to ferret out and kill suspected terrorist operatives, recorded on ""kill boards"" on base.After Mr. Hegseth left, Colonel Steele oversaw Operation Iron Triangle, after which three American soldiers were convicted of murder for killing Iraqi prisoners. Colonel Steele was formally reprimanded but did not face charges.""On that tour my eyes were open,"" Mr. Hegseth said. ""I was exposed to the reality of human nature, a vicious enemy, and I was forged and taught by these incredible patriots and warriors.""Colonel Steele ""understood the warrior ethos was very real,"" Mr. Hegseth said, and under his command, he learned that ""you subdue violence with violence.""The experience helped shape his views of men accused of war crimes, said Mr. Hegseth, who has advised that ""guys who make tough choices on the battlefield be given the benefit of the doubt.""Pentagon and military leaders have said that Mr. Trump's decisions could greatly reduce their ability to enforce discipline and could weaken the chain of command among the 1.3 million Americans on active duty.Mr. Hegseth vehemently disagreed with that view, his single flash of anger during a lengthy interview. ""You can maintain good order and discipline without throwing warriors under the bus,"" he said, adding, ""I think most of these characterizations are made by people who have never been in the type of situation that Gallagher has been in.""If endorsing strong-arm tactics while opposing a conservative military strategy seems complicated, that is the new normal under Mr. Trump.""When you get caught up in a movement, sometimes you promote things that make emotional sense at the moment but don't really make any sense overall,"" said Wade Zirkle, a Denver businessman and veteran who founded the pro-interventionist Vets for Freedom, then recruited Mr. Hegseth to take over.Mr. Zirkle credits Mr. Hegseth with raising money and the organization's profile but was surprised by his populist turn. ""He is enabling the president who has no respect for the military or respect for U.S. alliances abroad,"" Mr. Zirkle said.After Mr. Obama announced the Afghanistan troop increase, Mr. Hegseth volunteered to deploy to Kabul in 2011 and 2012. As a senior counterinsurgency instructor, ""I saw the clear disconnect between our strategy and reality,"" he said. ""We were selling a connect-with-the-locals message even though we knew that was not working.""Mr. Hegseth left the military early to run for the Senate in Minnesota but withdrew when he lost ground to a Tea Party candidate who then lost the general election. He earned a master's degree in public policy from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, then became the leader of Concerned Veterans for America, an advocacy group with ties to Charles Koch that has also been influential on Mr. Trump's views of veterans health care.Mr. Hegseth found the president's ear and more attention from Fox News bookers. ""It was never my intention to forge a relationship"" with the president, he said. ""I know that I have learned a great deal from the truths he has told, his courage on these issues to speak plainly and truly about topics that are usually spoken about in code.""Over the last year, Mr. Hegseth has seemed to move further and further from the bookish veteran of his initial television appearances. He was recently banned from Twitter -- where he has expressed support for the conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer's congressional campaign and retweeted the cartoonist Ben Garrison, who has been called anti-Semitic -- for posting part of a manifesto written by a Saudi aviation student who killed three people at Naval Air Station Pensacola.Mr. Hegseth has also earned criticism with some of his Fox commentary supporting Mr. Trump's more incendiary moments. He defended the president's comments after the 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Va., during which a white nationalist killed a protester by crashing his car into the crowd.""There's a reason those people were out there,"" he said. ""Some of it is outright racism and needs to be condemned. A lot of it, though, is I feel like my country is slipping away and just because I talk about nationalism, not white nationalism, doesn't mean I'm talking in code, that I'm a racist.""Despite his criticism of many conflicts overseas, Mr. Hegseth recently rejoined the Army as a commissioned major in the National Guard in Washington. From there, he could face deployment to a conflict with Iran.""We are in a generational struggle against radical Islam,"" he said.""I wouldn't put my views in a libertarian box or neocon box,"" he concluded. ""I believe in putting America first.""PhotographPresident Trump with the ""Fox & Friends"" host Pete Hegseth at a Make America Great Again rally in Billings, Mont., in September.

| Jump to first hitIn pressing toward their preordained vote of acquittal, Senate Republicans made it clear they see their fortunes and futures intertwined with the president's.WASHINGTON -- President Trump's control of Senate Republicans is nearly complete.In their almost unanimous vote on Friday to bar new impeachment trial witnesses, they once again raised one of the big questions in Washington over the past three years: Will Senate Republicans ever step in against the president and say, ""Enough?""Although many Senate Republicans have long expressed serious reservations about Mr. Trump's character and conduct in office -- and some went so far as to say the Democrats had successfully made their case against him -- little daylight is visible now. In pressing inexorably toward their preordained vote of acquittal, Senate Republicans made it clear they see their fortunes and futures intertwined with the president's, and are not willing to rock the 2020 boat.""Their party is a cult of personality at this point,"" said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut.Senators who normally are jealous guardians of their power over federal spending seemed to brush aside Mr. Trump's attempt to hold up military aid that Congress had allocated to Ukraine, an ally fighting Russian aggression on its eastern border. Mr. Trump's pressure campaign to leverage that aid in return for investigations of his political rivals is at the heart of the impeachment trial.The transformation of the Senate can be seen in the way Trump-like tactics have seeped in over recent days. Senator Martha McSally, the Arizona Republican appointed to replace John McCain, called a CNN reporter a ""liberal hack"" after he posed a routine question -- a break with civil press relations of the past. She then immediately started raising campaign money off it.Senator Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, the newest member of the Senate through her recent appointment, attacked Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, her fellow Republican, on Twitter for trying to ""appease the left"" by backing the idea of witnesses.Her clear aim was to curry favor with Mr. Trump and she may well have scored a success. But it was hard to imagine a freshly minted senator of the past arriving in Washington and almost immediately questioning the motives and views of a more senior senator who was also the former presidential nominee of her own party -- after making significant campaign contributions to him in the past.It is worth noting that Ms. Loeffler was appointed to fill the seat of the ailing Johnny Isakson, a Republican known for his bipartisan approach in the Senate and his love and respect for the institution. And Ms. McSally represents a distinct contrast with Mr. McCain, a frequent subject of criticism from the president and a man who closed out his career by depriving Mr. Trump of his campaign promise to repeal the Obama administration's new health care law.The departures of Mr. McCain and Mr. Isakson are just part of the steady loss of members willing to go their own way when it comes to the president. Outgoing senators are often replaced by much more conservative successors who have attached themselves to the president. It was lost on no member of the Senate that Jeff Flake of Arizona was essentially driven out for his willingness to find public fault with the president.Bob Corker of Tennessee, the former Republican senator who spoke up against Mr. Trump on occasion and drew the president's ire, decided not to seek another term in 2018 and has been replaced by Senator Marsha Blackburn, a conservative former House member who has been biting in her criticism of the impeachment trial and the presentation by House Democrats.""It's time to end this impeachment farce and get back to work for the American people,"" Ms. Blackburn said this week on Twitter.The shift has not been lost on former senators of both parties who are watching with dismay as the impeachment trial unfolds with a marked partisanship at odds from the trial of President Bill Clinton in 1999, when lawmakers found a way to work out their disagreements over the shape of the trial.""Not long ago, senators of both major parties always worked to accommodate fellow colleagues with different points of view to arrive at outcomes that would best serve the nation's interests,"" John Warner, a former senator from Virginia, said in a statement. Mr. Warner, who saw himself as a protector of the institution, said he worried that a trial without witnesses would do ""lasting damage to the Senate, and to our fragile national consensus.""Over the years, senators saw themselves as power centers of their own, rising above the House and able to show more independence because of their six-year terms and wider statewide representation. Early on, that sensibility was reflected in their arms-length approach to Mr. Trump when he was still a candidate. Many senators had little to no previous relationship with him.During the primary campaign, two prominent Republican senators challenging him -- Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Ted Cruz of Texas -- frequently raised alarm over the prospect of Mr. Trump in the White House. Mr. Cruz even shied away from endorsing him at the party's nominating convention. Both paid a price in Twitter abuse from the president, and both are now among his most ardent defenders.After Mr. Trump's election, other senators -- in private and public settings -- said they were concerned about the president's fitness for office and his Twitter rants against his critics and rivals. Senators split on a few issues and did not show the same fierce loyalty of Republican House members.Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who has exhibited an independent streak, confronted the president in the White House in 2017 over his attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, saying she was sent to Washington to represent her constituents and not toe the party line. She followed that up with a vote against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, Mr. Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court.But on Friday, as Ms. Murkowski cast an important vote against calling witnesses, she sounded a few Trumpian notes in lashing into Democrats for what she saw as a partisan show.""It has also become clear some of my colleagues intend to further politicize this process, and drag the Supreme Court into the fray, while attacking the chief justice,"" she said, referring to repeated efforts by Democrats to have Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., rule in favor of witnesses and to a question from Senator Elizabeth Warren that was critical of the chief justice. ""I will not stand for nor support that effort. We have already degraded this institution for partisan political benefit, and I will not enable those who wish to pull down another.""Republicans in tough re-election fights -- Ms. McSally, Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado and Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, among others -- are of the view that they need Mr. Trump, and his supporters in their states, to win.Democrats say they now fear that Mr. Trump, emboldened by his expected Senate acquittal, will be even less restrained exerting his authority. They aren't counting on Senate Republicans to do much about it.Trump on Trial is a continuing series of articles offering reporting, analysis and impressions of the Senate impeachment proceedings.Trump on Trial is a continuing series of articles offering reporting, analysis and impressions of the Senate impeachment proceedings.PhotographPresident Trump at the White House on Friday.
