| Jump to first hitSeveral vulnerable freshmen who had expressed reservations about the effort said they would vote to impeach President Trump, despite the political risks.WASHINGTON -- Democratic lawmakers representing conservative-leaning districts announced one by one on Monday that they would cast votes this week to impeach President Trump, signaling that a critical bloc of the most politically vulnerable Democrats is pulling together behind the party's effort to seek his removal from office.Two days ahead of a historic vote on two articles of impeachment, about a half-dozen first-term Democrats in districts that Mr. Trump won in 2016 -- all impeachment skeptics -- said they had become convinced that they had no choice but to move forward with official charges of high crimes and misdemeanors against the president.The House is all but certain to pass two articles of impeachment, for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, against Mr. Trump on Wednesday on a mostly party-line vote, making him the third president in history to be impeached.In comments to constituents, interviews and opinion pieces, and statements issued by their offices on Monday, the moderate Democrats said they were embracing impeachment fully aware that their decision could cost them their congressional careers.""What the president did was wrong,"" said Representative Ben McAdams of Utah, whose district skews Republican by 13 percentage points. ""His actions warrant accountability. I cannot turn a blind eye, thereby condoning this president and future presidents, Republican or Democrat, to do the same.""""I will vote yes, knowing full well the Senate will likely acquit the president in a display of partisan theater that Republicans and Democrats perform disturbingly well,"" Mr. McAdams added in a statement that criticized how members of both parties have handled the impeachment debate.Mr. McAdams and more than two dozen other moderate Democrats were at the forefront of the political wave that swept their party into the House majority in 2018 and gave the gavel to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who herself was an impeachment skeptic until charges emerged this fall that Mr. Trump had pressured Ukraine to help him in the 2020 election.The allegation that the president abused his power to exact political favors from Ukraine, withholding as leverage nearly $400 million in vital military aid and a White House meeting, changed the landscape for many centrists. And on Monday, they said the results of the House Intelligence Committee's investigation confirming the charges ultimately changed their minds.They described their decisions as driven by the Constitution and by history, not by politics.Representative Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, who represents a district where Republicans have a 10-point advantage, said Republicans had offered no convincing evidence to exonerate Mr. Trump, adding, ""This is simply about the rule of law.""""If I wanted to do what was easy politically, I would just vote no and move on,"" Mr. Cunningham told his hometown paper, The Post & Courier in Charleston, S.C. ""But it's about doing what's right for our country.""In Michigan, Representative Elissa Slotkin, a C.I.A. analyst, was greeted with jeers, chants and political threats from constituents at a town-hall-style meeting after revealing in a newspaper op-ed that she, too, would vote for both articles of impeachment.In comments to reporters after the meeting, Ms. Slotkin said the decision was a ""tough call.""""I knew it would be controversial either way,"" she said. ""And I feel very firmly that I'm doing what I think is right. It may be that voters decide in 2020 that they don't want me as their representative. I hope that's not the case. I really do.""The question at the heart of the impeachment debate is not whether Mr. Trump leaned on Ukraine to investigate one of his political rivals when Kyiv was in dire need of American military aid. Both Republicans and Democrats agree that he did. At issue is whether that constituted an egregious abuse of power that warrants impeachment.The statements of support from the Democratic lawmakers came as the House Judiciary Committee formally presented its case for impeaching Mr. Trump in a 658-page report published online early Monday morning, arguing ahead of the final vote in the House that he ""betrayed the nation by abusing his high office.""Across the Capitol, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, previewed a coming partisan clash over the procedures to govern an impeachment trial in the Senate, demanding for the second day in a row that Republicans call senior White House officials to testify as witnesses.About a dozen moderate Democrats have yet to announce how they will vote on Wednesday. Only two Democrats have indicated they will vote against impeaching Mr. Trump in a decision that could set in motion a Senate trial early next year.Representative Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota has signaled he intends to vote no. Representative Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey also plans to oppose the impeachment articles, but he plans to become a Republican either immediately before or just after the vote, leaving his own re-election chances murky in his swing district.Lawmakers began returning to the Capitol on Monday as Congress braced for one of the most consequential weeks in recent memory. On Tuesday, they are scheduled to vote on a $1.4 trillion spending deal to avert a government shutdown. And on Thursday, lawmakers are expected to approve a new North American trade pact to replace NAFTA.On Wednesday, the House will formally vote on the recommendations contained in the Judiciary Committee report, which echoes similar documents produced during the impeachment inquiries involving Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton.The report provides no new allegations or evidence. But it offers a detailed supporting argument for the two articles of impeachment the committee approved, charging that Mr. Trump abused the power of the presidency to enlist Ukraine in tarnishing his political rivals and obstructed Congress by blocking witnesses from testifying and refusing to provide documents.""President Trump has placed his personal, political interests above our national security, our free and fair elections, and our system of checks and balances,"" the report stated. ""He has engaged in a pattern of misconduct that will continue if left unchecked. Accordingly, President Trump should be impeached and removed from office.""On Monday, the Democrats who announced they would support the charges described their votes as statements of principle against Mr. Trump's conduct.Representative Jason Crow of Colorado, who announced his decision at a town-hall-style meeting in his district, told his constituents: ""No man or woman is above the law in our country, including the president.""Representative Abigail Spanberger of Virginia said she would vote to impeach the president because ""the world, and our children, are watching."" And Representative Andy Kim of New Jersey said in a statement that he was voting to impeach Mr. Trump to ""stand up to those that abuse the power entrusted to them by the people.""The Judiciary Committee's report argued that the House should charge Mr. Trump with abuse of power for holding up the security aid and the promise of a White House meeting until Ukraine agreed to announce investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and whether Ukraine conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 election.""When the president demands that a foreign government announce investigations targeting his domestic political rival, he corrupts our elections,"" the report said. ""To the founders, this kind of corruption was especially pernicious, and plainly merited impeachment. American elections should be for Americans only.""It also urged the House to approve an article of impeachment charging the president with obstruction of Congress, saying: ""President Trump's obstruction of Congress does not befit the leader of a democratic society. It calls to mind the very claims of royal privilege against which our founders rebelled.""The report included a scathing 20-page dissent from Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, who accused Democrats of conducting an unfair process in a partisan attempt to drive Mr. Trump from office because they dislike him and his policies.""The case is not only weak but dangerously lowers the bar for future impeachments,"" he wrote. ""The record put forth by the majority is based on inferences built upon presumptions and hearsay. In short, the majority has failed to make a credible, factually based allegation against this president that merits impeachment.""Looking toward a Senate trial, Mr. Schumer on Monday renewed his demand that senators who serve as jurors should hear from Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff; John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser; Robert Blair, a senior adviser to Mr. Mulvaney; and Michael Duffey, a top budget official.All four were blocked from testifying by the White House, which asserted a blanket privilege from cooperating with the impeachment inquiry.""By virtue of the senior administration positions they occupy, each of them will have information to share about the charges made by the House -- information that no one has heard at this point,"" Mr. Schumer said, adding that the Senate should also demand documents that the administration refused to provide to House investigators. ""How, on such a weighty matter, could we avoid hearing this?""The remarks by Mr. Schumer were the opening salvo in a coming negotiation with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. Mr. McConnell has signaled that he prefers a quick impeachment trial without witnesses, and has said that he will coordinate closely with Mr. Trump and his White House lawyers on the trial process.Republicans close to Mr. McConnell said that the senator planned to meet with Mr. Schumer, probably before the week is over, to begin discussions about how to conduct a trial. While Mr. McConnell, as majority leader, can dictate the terms of a trial, his slim 53-seat majority means that the handful of more moderate Republican members in his ranks will have influence over how it unfolds.Senator Susan Collins of Maine, one of those moderate Republicans, declined on Monday to say whether she wanted witnesses to testify.""I'm not going to make a judgment on the witness issue,"" Ms. Collins said. ""What I would like is for the leaders to sit down, as Senator McConnell has suggested, and work out a common set of procedures.""But Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, who is up for re-election next year, said she saw no need for the Senate to call additional witnesses for an impeachment case she called ""a political exercise from the start.""‪""I think we're good there,"" Ms. Ernst said. ""I mean, if the House wanted to do more, they could have done more. We don't need to clean up their sloppy job.""‬Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting from Rochester, Mich.; Patricia Mazzei from Summerville, S.C.; and Nicholas Fandos from Washington.PhotographThe Judiciary chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler, center left, and the ranking member, Representative Doug Collins, right.

| Jump to first hitWASHINGTON -- Former Representative Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican who is seeking a return to Congress, was caught in the fallout of the Ukraine scandal on Thursday when he was referred to in the indictment of two presidential allies accused of campaign finance allegations.Mr. Sessions, who served 11 terms in Congress until he was swept out last year, is described as ""Congressman-1"" in the indictment of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were arrested and charged on Thursday with illegally funneling foreign money to American political candidates and campaigns. The two men are associates of Rudolph W. Giuliani -- President Trump's personal lawyer and a point man in Mr. Trump's attempts to pressure Ukraine to dig up dirt on his political rivals -- and are believed to be important witnesses in the House's impeachment inquiry.Mr. Sessions's appearance in the indictment, which was filed just a week after he announced he would run for Congress in 2020, was an early and potentially damaging blow to his campaign.Mr. Sessions is not named in the indictment, nor is he accused of any wrongdoing. On Thursday, he issued a statement that denied any wrongdoing and said he had no knowledge of the scheme detailed by federal prosecutors.But a review of campaign finance records and his public comments show that he is the lawmaker referred to in the indictment as ""Congressman-1,"" who is described as having received large campaign contributions from Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, and whom Mr. Parnas asked for help in removing the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch.Ms. Yovanovitch had resisted Mr. Giuliani's efforts to persuade the Ukrainians to open a corruption investigation of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, as well as other Democrats, a top priority of Mr. Trump's that is now at the center of the impeachment inquiry.According to the indictment and campaign finance records, Mr. Sessions received the maximum allowable campaign donation of $2,700 in 2018 from both Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, as well as nearly $3 million in donations from America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC to which both had contributed.The pair's contributions were part of a broader effort ""so that the defendants could buy potential influence with candidates, campaigns and the candidates' governments,"" federal prosectors said. Mr. Sessions met the two men at a fund-raising event, and they later committed to raising $20,000 for him.The 21-page indictment asserted that Mr. Parnas met with Mr. Sessions ""at and around the same time"" he committed to raising money for the Texas Republican, and that Mr. Parnas asked the congressman to help oust Ms. Yovanovitch, who was eventually recalled by the Trump administration.That effort, federal lawyers concluded, was ""conducted, at least in part, at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials.""Mr. Sessions conceded in his statement on Thursday that he had, indeed, sought Ms. Yovanovitch's removal ""after several congressional colleagues reported to me that the current U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was disparaging President Trump to others as part of those official duties.""Mr. Sessions said Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman first approached him to discuss ""the strategic need for Ukraine to become energy independent,"" adding, ""At no time did I take any official action after these meetings.""The indictment was an unwelcome development for Mr. Sessions at the start of what was already shaping up as a potentially competitive primary for a seat in a safe Republican district. Rather than seeking to reclaim his old seat from Representative Colin Allred, the Democrat who ousted him in a Dallas district last year, Mr. Sessions announced last week that he would run to succeed the retiring Representative Bill Flores in a district 80 miles south.
With his loss to Mr. Allred fresh in their minds, some Republicans were already unsure whether Mr. Sessions would be the strongest candidate to succeed Mr. Flores.""This could definitely damage his chances in the district -- with voters, with people who are trying to play kingmaker,"" said Brendan Steinhauser, an Austin-based Republican strategist. ""It's going to be another argument from those who don't want him to run for this seat.""Mr. Flores has already cast doubt on Mr. Sessions's campaign, telling The Texas Tribune this month that Mr. Sessions had announced it without first consulting him and that feedback from district Republican leaders about him was ""not positive.""Other potential candidates have tested the waters, and conversations have centered on two Texans with national security credentials: David Springer, a lawyer who worked at the National Counterterrorism Center and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and Jeff Oppenheim, a defense consultant and West Point graduate.Mr. Sessions was not the only lawmaker to benefit from Mr. Parnas's largess. Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader, and Representative Joe Wilson, Republican of South Carolina, also received the maximum campaign contribution allowed by the Federal Election Commission, according to campaign finance records. Mr. Parnas also donated $3,800 to House Republicans' campaign arm, and Mr. Fruman donated nearly $67,000 under the name Igor Furman, according to campaign finance records.House Democrats' campaign arm called on the Republican leader and House Republicans' campaign arm on Thursday to return the contributions. On Thursday afternoon, Mr. McCarthy's spokesman said he would do so.""The deception documented in today's indictment has no place in our country and as a result, McCarthy plans to donate amounts received to a local charity,"" said Matt Sparks, the spokesman.The fallout from the Ukraine scandal continued to widen among veteran government officials late Thursday. Michael McKinley, a top aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a career diplomat who served as ambassador to Brazil, Afghanistan, Colombia and Peru, has resigned over concerns related to the matter, said one person familiar with the decision.Current and former officials say Mr. Pompeo had lost the trust of many department employees over his failure to defend diplomats whom the president criticized over the Ukraine issue, his backing of Mr. Trump's partisan stand on Ukraine and his public support of Mr. Trump's line on allowing Turkey to attack the Kurds, who have been able partners of the United States military in the fight against the Islamic State.Mr. McKinley and the State Department did not return requests for comment on Thursday night.Edward Wong contributed reporting from Hong Kong.PhotographRepresentative Pete Sessions on the campaign trail in 2018.

| Jump to first hitDemocrats have moved left, but the party's rank and file typically side with establishment favorites.Elizabeth Warren is gaining. She has breached 20 percent of the vote in recent national surveys and might hold a narrow lead in Iowa and New Hampshire. The prediction markets now consider her a clear favorite to win the nomination. It can be hard to see how her Democratic rivals will attack or stop her.But the challenge facing Ms. Warren, if past primaries are any indication, isn't those rivals. It is whether she will hit a wall: the rank and file of the Democratic primary electorate.In primary after primary, the candidates of the party's left-liberal activists have failed to win the more typical members of the Democratic Party. These voters don't show up at rallies or post on political Twitter. They are more moderate. They are disproportionately nonwhite; Southern; and less likely to have graduated from college. But in the modern era, they have usually had the votes to decide the nomination. In August, they even had the votes to sway an Iowa straw poll to Joe Biden when other candidates attracted far bigger crowds at the same fair.To win the nomination, Ms. Warren will need to advance beyond her factional base to a broader coalition. Historically, many left-liberal candidates have found it easy to attract 20-plus percent in the polls and five-digit crowds on the stump. Howard Dean (2004) and Bernie Sanders (2016) had done so by this point in the election cycle. But such candidates have found it far harder to win.Those who manage to pull it off, like Barack Obama nationally or Bill de Blasio and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York City, often have special appeal to nonwhite voters. Without that advantage, they might have fallen short, as Zephyr Teachout and Cynthia Nixon did in New York State, or Jerry Brown and Gary Hart in presidential races.There are important factors, which we'll get to, that might make it easier today for a left-liberal candidate to win. The ranks of the activists have swelled in recent years, and Ms. Warren's opposition could prove weak as well.For now, it is not clear whether Ms. Warren has made the breakthrough. And until she does, it will be an open question whether her pitch has what it takes to succeed where previous white activist-favorite candidates have fallen short.Ms. Warren holds the support of just 10 percent of black voters and 10 percent of Hispanic voters in a recent CNN/SSRS poll. That survey included large samples of black and Hispanic voters, providing a clearer look than usual at these groups. She had the support of just 12 percent of moderate and conservative Democrats in the same poll, and of 15 percent among whites without a college degree.Some polls have shown Ms. Warren making additional gains with nonwhite and more moderate voters over the last few weeks. A Quinnipiac poll last weekend, for instance, found that 19 percent of black voters supported her nationwide. If confirmed in other surveys, it will show her with signs of strength that a candidate like Mr. Sanders never claimed in 2016. Not all polls show this move -- a CNN poll this weekend, for instance, found her at just 4 percent among black voters in South Carolina.This does not mean she has a ""ceiling"" on her overall support, in the sense that there is a hard cap on it. In surveys, a large majority of Democrats like Ms. Warren and say they're considering her for the nomination. And the substantively populist elements of her appeal could help her break through among low-income voters.But the weak track record of the activist-backed candidates suggests there is something limited about the appeal of candidates who depend on policy, ideological argument or idealism. These are just some of many factors for most people. They have policy views, too, but not with the kind of depth or passion that would leave them feeling strongly about intraparty disputes, like a public option versus ""Medicare for all.""Establishment-backed candidates have typically had the inside path to votes of the less engaged and less ideological remainder of the electorate. Those candidates often bring name recognition; a reservoir of good will; perceived electability; and superior financial resources. Perhaps they also have advantages on the superficial dimensions of politics that have allowed them to succeed throughout their career. And of course, there are some number of moderates who are alienated by the activist candidates.History, however, does not always repeat. It's possible that the obstacles for a left-liberal favorite like Ms. Warren have grown less formidable, because of a leftward shift in the Democratic electorate.In 2008, moderates outnumbered liberals by a 20-point margin. Today, the Democratic Party is roughly evenly divided between liberals on one side and moderates and conservatives on the other.The party is also split in roughly three ways between nonwhite voters, white college graduates and whites without a degree. Back in 2008, whites without a college degree outnumbered white college graduates by nearly a two-to-one margin.To some extent, the party's politicians have matched this shift. Mr. Biden's current policy positions are arguably to the left of those of past activist favorites, like Mr. Obama in 2008, who opposed same-sex marriage, or Mr. Dean in 2004, who emphasized a balanced budget and argued to allow Americans to buy into the private health plans available to federal employees. Mr. Brown was a flat-taxer in 1992.Mr. Biden's gradual ideological drift over his long career, which has kept him close to the center of the party, illustrates the adaptability of the establishment-backed candidates, who usually move just enough to neutralize ideological considerations for a majority of a party's voters.But the changing composition of Democratic voters shows more than just ideological movement. It reflects a more engaged and policy-aware electorate, which is basically a prerequisite for voting for the kind of ideas-based campaign that activist-backed candidates tend to mount.And Mr. Biden is not the strongest of establishment favorites, if he even counts as one. His endorsement tallies are underwhelming. His poll numbers are good enough to put him in the lead -- but still put him behind all of the comparable candidates in the modern primary era, going back to the 1970s. This might be in part because of the size of the field, but his inability to deter challengers is probably an indication of his weakness as well.He is relatively weak in the first two contests, Iowa and New Hampshire; it is easy to imagine him losing both.And he is highly unlikely to command a substantial fund-raising advantage, once a key advantage for the establishment favorites. This is as much about longer-term trends in fund-raising than anything about Mr. Biden, but he appears likely to be outspent, perhaps even by a wide margin, if the field narrows. Mr. Sanders managed to narrowly outspend Hillary Clinton's fund-raising juggernaut in 2016, and Mr. Biden is not matching Mrs. Clinton's tallies to this point.And then there are the questions beyond the data, like Mr. Biden's age (76), his uncertain performance in the debates, and his long record.Mr. Biden's resilience in the polls suggests that these issues might not be quite as problematic for his candidacy as they seem. It could be a Democratic version of what happened in the 2016 Republican primary, when Donald J. Trump easily won despite the fact that highly informed, college-educated and conservative voters found him unsuited for the presidency and insufficiently conservative. But it might still prove fatal to Mr. Biden's chances, by slowly eroding his numbers or limiting his upward potential, allowing Ms. Warren to slip by with a narrower coalition than would typically be necessary.He can also make an electability pitch, which most Democrats say they prioritize. He leads Mr. Trump by eight percentage points in the Real Clear Politics polling average, double Ms. Warren's four-point lead. Although it's generally unwise to put stock in these head-to-head polling matchups so far ahead of the election, it's hard to convince most voters of that.In the end, Ms. Warren could easily win the nomination. Perhaps she should even be considered the favorite (as bettors see it), especially if longstanding doubts about Mr. Biden's ability to maintain his support finally materialize in the polls. But for now, her poll numbers are not quite so high and her support not so broad that she has resolved questions about whether she will be a mere factional candidate, of the sort that has typically gone on to lose.PhotographElizabeth Warren has helped shift the Democrats to the left, but the party's rank and file typically side with establishment favorites.

| Jump to first hitMs. Klobuchar's campaign operation is expanding as some rivals' are contracting. ""I'm hearing more talk about Amy,"" a New Hampshire Democratic leader said. ""People have heard from the other candidates and they're still looking.""HENNIKER, N.H. -- For months, Senator Amy Klobuchar has been the Democratic presidential candidate turning down the music at the party.As Senator Elizabeth Warren promised ""big, structural change,"" and Senator Bernie Sanders offered his brand of ""political revolution,"" Ms. Klobuchar was steadily reminding voters of the factors that have long mattered in national politics, at least before the election of a certain current president: expense, experience and electability.Now, as the moderate wing of the party reasserts itself in the primary campaign, her message of plain-spoken politics is drawing greater attention.""What was happening early on was that there was this belief that only those guys had bold ideas,"" Ms. Klobuchar, of Minnesota, said in an interview, as she campaigned across New Hampshire this weekend. ""I have plans, too. I have bold plans, too. And no one has a monopoly on good ideas.""As her rivals falter, Ms. Klobuchar has outlasted some national figures, like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and former Representative Beto O'Rourke, and she is one of just six candidates, so far, to have qualified for the next debate in December. Enough money has flowed in for her to expand her operation; she has doubled her offices in Iowa and her staff in New Hampshire at a time when many of her rivals are worried about contracting. After months stuck toward the bottom of the polls, she has earned around 5 percent in several recent surveys of early-voting states, as voters give her a second look.And in perhaps the highest mark of progress yet, her strong performance in last week's debate inspired a spoof on ""Saturday Night Live,"" albeit one largely focused on her quivering bangs. (Ms. Klobuchar said she was standing under an air vent during the debate and hadn't used enough hair spray.)Hoping to ride a wave of post-debate attention, Ms. Klobuchar planned to blaze through New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina this week, stopping briefly in Des Moines for a Thanksgiving Day celebration at the home of her campaign's state chairwoman.""I'm hearing more talk about Amy. It's picked up in the last couple weeks,"" said Laurie McCray, the Democratic Party chairwoman in Portsmouth, N.H. ""People have heard from the other candidates and they're still looking.""The fresh interest comes as Democratic leaders express vocal concerns about whether sweeping progressive policies, like Medicare for all, could hurt the party in key battleground states. As some center-left voters seek an alternative to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and as former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York have entered the race, the competition to emerge as the party's moderate standard-bearer has intensified.Ms. Klobuchar is in the hunt, though far from its leader. Her poll numbers in the early states have doubled, but her single-digit support leaves her solidly in the race's second tier. She has very little backing from black and Latino voters, a significant portion of the party's base. At the same time, it's unclear whether she can pull enough white voters away from Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., the other Midwestern moderate in the race and the current poll-leader in Iowa.Ms. Klobuchar's campaign says it raised $1 million in small-dollar donations in the 24 hours after the October debate, enabling her to hire staff in South Carolina and Nevada, but it declined to reveal how much money came in following last week's debate performance. Her bank account is still dwarfed by her rivals'. As of the most recent fund-raising quarter, which ended Sept. 30, she had $3.7 million in cash on hand, putting her eighth in the field, and more than $20 million behind Mr. Buttigieg.But supporters of Ms. Klobuchar believe Mr. Buttigieg may have peaked too early. They argue her energy is coming at just the right time, long enough before the Iowa caucuses to allow Ms. Klobuchar to expand her operation but not so early that their momentum is gone by early February, when caucusing and voting begins. Aides are particularly cheered by their internal data showing Ms. Klobuchar as a second or third choice for many expected to caucus in Iowa.They argue that even a fifth-place finish there could be enough to keep Ms. Klobuchar in the contest, given the size of the field.""Our momentum says we're doing pretty damn well in Iowa,"" said her state party chairwoman Andy McGuire, who is hosting Ms. Klobuchar, her husband and daughter for Thanksgiving at her home on Thursday. ""She'll at least be in the top five. I think she could be in the top three and that would be wonderful.""For some voters, going all the way with Amy K. -- the slogan for her first election, in fourth grade, and a laugh line in her stump speech -- has been a process of elimination, as they search for a candidate they believe best embodies the most prized of all virtues in the primary race: electability.As he waited for Ms. Klobuchar to address a small crowd on a rainy Friday afternoon, Stan Lloyd, 68, ticked off the qualities that have kept Ms. Klobuchar on his list of potential candidates to support.She's a Midwestern woman from a liberal state, allowing her to argue that she can both win in a battleground region and champion progressive values. She touts her long legislative record in the Senate, casting herself as a can-do, results-driven legislator. And, he noted, she's only 59.""I'm not interested in another old white man like Bloomberg. I'm sad about Joe. I saw him at a town hall yesterday and it was painful,"" said Mr. Lloyd, a retired guidance counselor from Loudon, N.H. ""I've eliminated a few candidates in my mind. Amy, she's still in the running.""Ms. Klobuchar attributes her new momentum to frugality, consistency and a move by voters toward more moderate candidates. She points to her fluency in policy issues and her early and vocal opposition to proposals like free college and Medicare for all.But the core of her argument remains her contention that she is the most equipped to defeat President Trump, as a Midwestern senator who won counties that supported him. On the campaign trail, she cites recent Democratic victories in Kentucky and Louisiana as signs that the party can win in red states with the right message -- and messenger.As she traveled through New Hampshire, Ms. Klobuchar hoped to tap into the sense of anxiety many Democrats still feel about their 2016 loss, casting herself as the solution to their fears.""My message to you right here from the start is very profound, we can't screw this up,"" she said. ""We cannot eke by with a victory in one state, even if it's New Hampshire. We have to win big and we have to win across the country.""Along with questioning the liberal policies put forward by Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, Ms. Klobuchar has increasingly begun contrasting herself with the more moderate candidates in the race. During the debate, she went after Mr. Buttigieg's limited résumé, arguing that women who run for office are held to a higher standard.While Ms. Klobuchar said she doesn't want to be seen as ""harping"" on sexism in politics or ""defined"" by her gender, she worries that some voters don't believe a woman can beat Mr. Trump.""To make the case, you really have to bring people somewhere else in their minds,"" she said. ""Believe it or not, a woman is the one that can get these suburban and rural voters away from Donald Trump.""She criticized Mr. Buttigieg again on Friday evening, mentioning a tweet he sent in 2018 saying he backed single-payer health care.""Now he's trying to get around it,"" she told an audience in Manchester, N.H. ""O.K. But I think people are really looking for someone who is true to what they are from the beginning.""And she took on the nascent candidacy of Mr. Bloomberg and his plans to spend more than $30 million on a single week of television ads, citing her mother, an elementary school teacher, and her father, a newspaperman, as she cast herself as ""the opposite of some of these wealthy people running.""In private conversations, at least one second-tier candidate admitted to being mystified by Ms. Klobuchar's success, puzzled by her fund-raising numbers and ability to capture attention. In public speeches, some of her rivals urge voters to vote with their hearts, rather than try to predict who can win over swing voters.That's an argument that fails to convince even some liberal voters, who say the party must prioritize perceived electoral strength over policy positions.After hearing Ms. Klobuchar speak, Susan and Roger Shamel, retirees and climate activists, said they were willing to put ideology aside for this election cycle. Four years after supporting Mr. Sanders, they lined up to take a selfie with Ms. Klobuchar.""Being from the Midwest, and I have a lot of friends and family there, I'm hearing from these people, Warren and Bernie can't win there,"" said Ms. Shamel, who is considering supporting Ms. Klobuchar.Her husband agreed: ""We've got to beat Trump no matter what.""Reid J. Epstein contributed reporting from Washington.PhotographAmy Klobuchar, at a town hall Friday in New Hampshire, has seen her poll numbers rise recently.

| Jump to first hitAfter Kamala Harris's departure from the presidential race, the people who saw their own paths reflected in hers are thinking about what comes next.WASHINGTON -- The first black woman to be elected mayor of San Francisco, London Breed, considers Senator Kamala Harris something of a political soul mate. When Ms. Harris announced her White House bid in Oakland, Calif., in January, Ms. Breed was one of the 20,000 supporters there loudly celebrating, and she endorsed the campaign from the beginning.But in the days since Ms. Harris dropped out of the race last week, Ms. Breed has been reflecting on the moments that were less celebratory, like the questions that continually dogged Ms. Harris about whether a black woman could win.They are questions Ms. Breed has heard herself. When she first considered making her first bid for elected office at age 37, with a run for the San Francisco board of supervisors in 2012, several people urged her to go for a lower position or move to another district, one with a larger African-American population.The message then -- and now -- was clear to her: Limit your sights. There's only so much a black woman in politics can do.""I keep going back to a lot of people telling me there's no way I can win in my district, they thought I could never get elected to my seat,"" she said. ""Why is it more natural for a white man to be electable than an African-American woman?""Ms. Breed is far from alone in wondering what Ms. Harris's aborted run means for the political standing of black women in Democratic politics. The California senator's decision to exit the race before the first round of voting has sparked an emotional reckoning, as the small sorority of prominent elected black female officials, strategists and candidates find themselves grappling with how Ms. Harris fell from a top contender to near the bottom of the pack, why she failed to attract black supporters and wondering what it will take for one of them to not only run, but also win, the White House.For the first time in their political lives, many saw their own identity reflected in Ms. Harris's bid, in the photos of her as a young girl in braids, her membership in the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, her stories of being bused into a white school district and her drum line dance moves.They also saw in her effort a Democratic Party establishment unwilling to fully back their candidacies, even as black women remain the party's most loyal supporters. And they saw confirmation of how much more difficult it can be for a black woman to raise money from people who like her but just aren't convinced she should be -- or could be elected -- president.Representative Barbara Lee, who represents Oakland, said the possibility of an all-white slate of top-tier candidates -- and the likelihood of an entirely white roster at this month's presidential debate -- after Ms. Harris's exit from the race demonstrates a lack of respect for black women at the highest levels.""The issues that will be brought up will not be brought up from a black woman's perspective,"" said Ms. Lee, who was one of Ms. Harris' campaign co-chairs. ""We've elected everyone to office, so why shouldn't we be the commander in chief?""While Ms. Harris's bid wasn't a historic first, her candidacy was groundbreaking for how seriously her effort was taken by the political establishment. The third black woman to run for the White House, she cast her campaign in the direct shadow of the first, opening her effort with a red-and-yellow logo that was a nod to Shirley Chisholm's bid.""She broke a glass ceiling for women of color,"" said Representative Karen Bass, a Democrat from California and the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. ""There will be more African-American women running in the next presidential race. Maybe it will even be Kamala herself.""Supporters acknowledge that many of the problems faced by Ms. Harris's presidential campaign were self-inflicted, having little to do with her race or gender. They list failings like strategic miscalculations that had her ignoring Iowa and New Hampshire for the first months of the race, a lack of leadership within her operation and an inability to articulate a consistent rationale for her candidacy. Her critics argue that those missteps suggested to voters that Ms. Harris was unprepared for the presidency, lending credence to arguments questioning her electability.But her supporters note that she faced a level of scrutiny that unsuccessful white male candidates, like former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas, seemed to escape.""There was a particular focus on her, which just speaks to the double standard that all women candidates and candidates of color face,"" said Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, a super PAC focused on African-American Democrats, who is unaffiliated in the race. ""That scrutinizing of missteps in the campaign isn't applied equally.""While record-breaking numbers of black women were elected to Congress last year, they have struggled to break into higher positions. A black woman has never served as governor, and only two have served in the Senate, Ms. Harris and Carol Moseley Braun, of Illinois.Last year, Stacey Abrams, of Georgia, became the first black woman to win her party's nomination for governor in United States history.Within the limited academic research detailing the barriers black women face, there is a broad consensus that there are additional obstacles. Their efforts can become a circle of self-defeat: Political strategists, party leaders and donors doubt whether they can win majority-white areas, so they don't support their bid. Because they don't have early support, it creates more skepticism of their candidacy from the political establishment.Aides who worked on Ms. Abrams's campaign said they waged a ""concurrent campaign of belief."" They needed to win voters the way any candidate would, by meeting people and putting forward appealing policies. And they needed to convince skeptics that just because a black woman had never won in a Southern state, that didn't mean she couldn't.Those problems were supersized for Ms. Harris, who ran in a campaign cycle in which Democratic voters are intensely focused on their ideas of who can defeat President Trump.""This whole electability conversation I think is super tone deaf,"" said Representative Lauren Underwood, who became the first woman and first person of color to represent her majority-white Illinois district last year. ""We can win, and we do all across the country.""Ms. Harris tried to tackle that concern directly, bringing up what she called the ""donkey in the room"" at town hall meetings and rallies. When she addressed her race and gender, she cast her candidacy in aspirational terms, urging voters to ""believe in what can be unburdened by what has been.""She also argued that the path to winning back the Midwest could run through black voters in places like Detroit as easily as the white suburbs. Yet risk-averse older black voters worried that Ms. Harris's race would be a difficult sell to white voters in key swing states.Still others argue that Ms. Harris's bid shows that the real risk is not leaning enough into identity, something future candidates will have to do to succeed.""The advice for black women who are running is to lean into the fact that fellow black women are the most powerful Democrats, we have a unique position and strength,"" said Aimee Allison, the founder of She the People, a group focused on increasing political power among women of colorYet perhaps the most significant challenge facing black female candidates, according to strategists, is one that eventually undid Ms. Harris's effort: money.As her campaign dropped in the polls, aides to Ms. Harris frequently pointed to former Senator John Kerry's primary campaign as an example of how a candidacy can rebound. During his 2003 primary effort, Mr. Kerry fell in the polls throughout the fall before rebounding to win the Iowa caucuses. At the lowest point, Mr. Kerry lent his effort $6.4 million of his family fortune to keep his campaign afloat, a financial infusion Ms. Harris was unable to supply or raise from donors.""There's a huge racial wealth gap, so you don't have a level playing field,"" Ms. Lee said, pointing to Mayor Pete Buttigieg's ability to raise money from wealthy gay donors. ""You look at the wealth gap and you look at the donor base and you look at who has the money and who doesn't have the money, these are some very deep questions that we should be talking about.""Now with clear evidence on how much this limits politicians at even the highest levels, Ms. Lee said, donors and politicians have to confront it directly.Ms. Bass said that when she raises money for her re-election in Los Angeles, she often faces skepticism. She imagines that Ms. Harris faced similar difficulties.""People question why I need money, but they don't bat an eye when a white man from a very similar district"" makes a similar request, Ms. Bass said. ""Typically there's just an assumption that a man needs the money. Usually if I point that out they immediately recognize the discrepancy, but that doesn't mean I always get the check.""Many saw clear challenges in Ms. Harris's run, but they also remain hopeful. The third black woman to run for the White House will not be the last, they say confidently.There are clear signs of progress in recruitment and the public discussion about diverse leadership, for example. Others see different signs of advancement.As Ms. Moseley Braun, the second black woman to run for president, watched Ms. Harris campaign, she couldn't help thinking how much less uncomfortable, at least physically, the whole ordeal seemed.When Ms. Moseley Braun ran, candidates sat on stools at campaign events that were so tall that they left her legs dangling off the side, she recalled. And then there was the practice of the candidates locking hands and raising them over their heads at the end of each debate, like a human chain of rivals.""As the only girl in the race at that time, it made my boobs look crooked on television,"" recalled Ms. Braun, who is backing former Vice President Joseph R. Biden in the primary race. ""It seems there has been progress.""PhotographKamala Harris with supporters in Las Vegas last month.

| Jump to first hitIt was the first time the former vice president expressed support for full impeachment. He had previously backed a congressional inquiry.ROCHESTER, N.H. -- Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Wednesday called for President Trump's impeachment for the first time, blistering Mr. Trump as a threat to American democracy and accusing him of ""shooting holes in the Constitution.""Escalating his language in an effort to rebut Mr. Trump's unfounded claims about his actions with Ukraine, Mr. Biden set aside months of restraint to demand Congress move against the president.""To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached,"" the former vice president told supporters here, accusing Mr. Trump of having ""betrayed this nation.""Mr. Biden even linked Mr. Trump's false claims to the so-called Big Lie idea promulgated by the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. ""You say it long enough, often enough, people may believe it,"" he said, invoking Goebbels by name.While Mr. Biden stopped short of calling for Mr. Trump's removal from office, his new aggressiveness marked an acknowledgment that he must do more to both confront a president who is attacking him daily and to halt his slide in the polls in the Democratic primary.The former vice president has openly wrestled with how forceful to be with Mr. Trump, lamenting last week that the president wants to drag opponents into ""a mud fight."" But Mr. Biden is increasingly sharpening his rhetoric under pressure from allies to embrace the head-to-head race.Mr. Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry in the House because of his request to the Ukrainian government that it look into what Mr. Biden did with the country when his son, Hunter Biden, was working for a gas company there. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden again denied that he did anything improper as vice president. And he accused Mr. Trump, who has accused Mr. Biden of corruption and whose campaign is airing ads repeating the same claim, of acting entirely out of a desire to undermine his candidacy.""We're not going to let Donald Trump pick the Democratic nominee for president, period,"" said Mr. Biden, who has fallen behind Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in a series of national and early nominating state polls. ""He's picked a fight with the wrong guy.""The president apparently watched the speech, or was told of it, because even before it was over he noted on Twitter that Mr. Biden had called for his impeachment and claimed the Bidens had ""ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars.""""Joe's Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!"" wrote Mr. Trump.There is no evidence that Hunter Biden made millions of dollars from his overseas work or that his father intervened inappropriately with Ukraine or China, the other country Mr. Trump was alluding to in his tweet. The president has also urged China to look into the Bidens.Mr. Biden again denied that he did anything improper as vice president. He noted that his 2016 call to fire Ukraine's prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, was part of United States government policy under President Barack Obama. It also reflected the wishes of a group of Republican senators at the time, who sought Mr. Shokin's ouster because he was seen as unwilling to target corruption, Mr. Biden said.A longtime senator before he became vice president, Mr. Biden is deferential to congressional prerogatives and has resisted calling for impeachment, even as Ms. Warren and many of his other Democratic rivals have been outspoken in demanding it.Last month, when House Democrats began moving toward an impeachment inquiry, he said they should only do so if Mr. Trump did not cooperate with their investigation. Then last week he said he would let Congress ""do its job on impeachment."" And at a later event on Wednesday, in Manchester, N.H., he nodded to his longstanding discomfort with impeachment, calling it ""a God-awful thing for a nation to go through.""But as Mr. Trump and his allies wage near-daily political warfare against Mr. Biden, he has sought to mount a counteroffensive.He began his rebuttal in a speech last week in Reno, Nev., but on Wednesday he went even further. Speaking from a teleprompter and dressed formally in suit and tie, he used his first trip back to New Hampshire since the impeachment investigation got underway to both taunt and condemn Mr. Trump in remarkably stark language.""He's afraid about just how badly I will beat him next November,"" said Mr. Biden, attempting to frame the general election as a contest between him and the president, and appealing to Democratic voters here and elsewhere who are consumed with finding a nominee who can oust Mr. Trump.But he also used his speech, which lasted just under 30 minutes, to warn of the damage he claimed Mr. Trump was doing to the country.""We all laughed when he said could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it,"" said Mr. Biden. ""It's no joke. He's shooting holes in the Constitution, and we cannot let him get away with it.""He argued that impeachment was crucial not just because of what the president had done but also in trying to curb Mr. Trump from committing additional abuses in office.For Mr. Biden, the question now is how to balance countering Mr. Trump's onslaught with articulating his own policy vision and contrasting himself with his Democratic opponents. He sought to do all three in his appearance in Manchester, reciting many of his same lines about Mr. Trump at the outset of his speech before turning to his record on gun control and domestic violence prevention.""It takes a proven ability to get things done,"" he said.And, he reminded the audience in an unmistakable reference to Ms. Warren's raft of policy plans, ""We're not electing a planner.""Photograph""He's shooting holes in the Constitution, and we cannot let him get away with it,"" said former Vice President Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitIt's a big week for the impeachment inquiry -- but the Democratic candidates aren't talking about it.Hi. Welcome to On Politics , your guide to the day in national politics. I'm Reid Epstein, your host for today. Lisa is on vacation -- but never fear, she will return soon!In Washington, the impeachment inquiry of President Trump is Topic A, B and C. It gets talked about on the sidelines of kiddie soccer games and on awkward first dates. It dominates cable news coverage, suffocating presidential campaigns struggling to get attention. When public hearings begin later this week, local bars will host the sort of viewing parties that normal cities would have when the local team plays in the Super Bowl or the World Series.But out in the real world, where the presidential campaign is marching on, impeachment is far from the minds of Democrats who are preparing to choose the party's 2020 nominee. Even since Speaker Nancy Pelosi opened the House's formal impeachment proceedings in September, voters and caucusgoers have been asking candidates about the issues that have mattered most since the campaign began: health care, the economy and how they are going to beat Mr. Trump -- who, by the way, brings up impeachment almost every chance he gets.The divide is just another example of our bifurcated politics. Just as Republicans and Democrats have very different media appetites, Democrats in the capital and those on the campaign trail have seemingly diametrically opposed views about what the most important issue of the day is. There is a seemingly endless parade of Democrats to cable news cameras and green rooms to opine about the case to remove the president. In Iowa and New Hampshire, Democrats are talking about practically anything else.In the last two months, Senator Elizabeth Warren has taken 140 questions from would-be voters and caucusgoers at 31 campaign events, her campaign said. Zero of them have been about impeachment. Since June, former Vice President Joe Biden has taken more than 50 questions from voters at New Hampshire town hall stops and just one was about impeachment, an aide said.And when The Des Moines Register tracked the types of questions posed to 17 candidates across three weeks of campaign events in Iowa, the paper's reporters found just 10 of 321 questions were about Mr. Trump. ""On the day the U.S. House voted on impeachment rules, people asked former Vice President Joe Biden about criminal justice, energy, governing and health care,"" the paper wrote.So why is this?First, there is not much difference between the Democratic presidential candidates on the issue. They all have come out in favor of the impeachment inquiry (though Tulsi Gabbard was late to backing it and has since attacked the process during Fox News appearances).And second, voters and caucusgoers my Times colleagues and I have spoken with recently think it's pretty likely that the impeachment drama will be over and done with before next November -- and maybe even before the primaries and caucuses begin in February.Maybe this dynamic will change if and when the House impeaches Mr. Trump and the Senate holds a trial, forcing the six senators in the race back to Washington. But for now that prospect isn't making them any chattier about impeachment when they are in Iowa.""That's my favorite reporter question: Will your schedule change if there's an impeachment trial?"" Senator Amy Klobuchar told me this month when I caught up with her in Wyoming, Iowa. ""Yes, yes. But you see, I have the most endorsements of anyone from elected officials in the presidential race, so I have a lot of nice surrogates.""Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We'll try to answer it. Have a comment? We're all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com .Why do rival Democrats hate Mayor Pete?Lisa and I wrote a story for Sunday's paper about how the rest of the 2020 Democratic presidential field is aggrieved by the attention, success and financial heft of Pete Buttigieg. And the article itself served as a Rorschach test for what people think of the candidate.Some read the story and saw a field of more-established politicians envious of the 37-year-old South Bend mayor's success. Joe Scarborough, the MSNBC host, drew a parallel to the resentment aimed at Barack Obama 12 years ago.Others agreed with candidates like Amy Klobuchar and Steve Bullock that Mr. Buttigieg's electoral history leaves a lot to be desired, or with Julián Castro that Democrats can't put forward a nominee who has demonstrated limited appeal to black and Hispanic voters.Republicans giggled at the intraparty sniping at a rising star in Democratic politics. ""The Democrat's triggered culture is now triggering each other,"" wrote Marc Lotter, the strategic communications director for Mr. Trump's re-election campaign, who included a crying-laughing face emoji in his tweet about the article.We're about to enter a much more cutthroat stage of the Democratic presidential contest. A whittling of the field is coming: While 10 candidates have qualified for the Nov. 20 debate in Atlanta, just six have punched their tickets to the Dec. 19 debate in Los Angeles. Candidates on the brink are showing signs of desperation -- just look at the attacks from Mr. Castro, who hasn't qualified for either debate, on Mr. Buttigieg and the Iowa caucus process in the last week. Expect to see more sniping at the leading candidates as those on the outside stare down the looming demise of their campaigns.... SeriouslyIt's hard to stop watching this video of a Buttigieg organizer teaching supporters in Nevada the choreography for the official Pete campaign dance.Were you forwarded this newsletter?

| Jump to first hitIn September, an obscure Twitter account promoting a fringe belief about an anti-Trump cabal within the government tweeted out a hashtag: #FakeWhistleblower.It was typical for the anonymous account, which traffics in far-right content and a conspiracy theory known as QAnon, some of whose adherents think that satanic pedophiles control the ""deep state."" The Federal Bureau of Investigation recently labeled QAnon a potential domestic terror threat.Still, that did not stop others, including a Republican congressional candidate, from quickly picking up the hashtag and tweeting it. Within a week, hundreds of QAnon believers and ""MAGA"" activists had joined in, posting memes and bogus reports to undermine the complaint by a government whistle-blower that President Trump had pressed Ukraine's leader for dirt on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son.Then Mr. Trump tweeted the hashtag himself.Such is the frenetic life cycle of conspiracy-driven propaganda, fakery and hate in the age of the first Twitter presidency. Mr. Trump, whose own tweets have warned of deep-state plots against him, accused the House speaker of treason and labeled Republican critics ""human scum,"" has helped spread a culture of suspicion and distrust of facts into the political mainstream.The president is also awash in an often toxic torrent that sluices into his Twitter account -- roughly 1,000 tweets per minute, many intended for his eyes. Tweets that tag his handle, @realDonaldTrump, can be found with hashtags like #HitlerDidNothingWrong, #IslamIsSatanism and #WhiteGenocide. While filters can block offensive material, the president clearly sees some of it, because he dips into the frothing currents and serves up noxious bits to the rest of the world.By retweeting suspect accounts, seemingly without regard for their identity or motives, he has lent credibility to white nationalists, anti-Muslim bigots and obscure QAnon adherents like VB Nationalist, an anonymous account that has promoted a hoax about top Democrats worshiping the Devil and engaging in child sex trafficking.""I've been retweeted by the President of the United States, President Trump!"" replied VB Nationalist, who gained thousands of followers after the high-level boost and took it as a sign of encouragement, adding, ""Tell me again, how he doesn't care about us.""To assess this unprecedented moment, The New York Times examined Mr. Trump's interactions with Twitter since he took office, reviewing each of his more than 11,000 tweets and the hundreds of accounts he has retweeted, tracking the ways he is exposed to information and replicating what he is likely to see on the platform. The result, including new data analysis and previously unreported details, offers the most comprehensive view yet of a virtual world in which the president spends significant time mingling with extremists, impostors and spies.Fake accounts tied to intelligence services in China, Iran and Russia had directed thousands of tweets at Mr. Trump, according to a Times analysis of propaganda accounts suspended by Twitter. Iranian operatives tweeted anti-Semitic tropes, saying that Mr. Trump was ""being controlled"" by global Zionists, and that pulling out of the Iran nuclear treaty would benefit North Korea. Russian accounts tagged the president more than 30,000 times, including in supportive tweets about the Mexican border wall and his hectoring of black football players. Mr. Trump even retweeted a phony Russian account that said, ""We love you, Mr. President!""In fact, Mr. Trump has retweeted at least 145 unverified accounts that have pushed conspiracy or fringe content, including more than two dozen that have since been suspended by Twitter. Tinfoil-hat types and racists celebrate when Mr. Trump shares something they promote. After he tweeted his support for white farmers in South Africa, replies included ""DONALD IS KING!"" and ""No black man can develop land.""The president gets some of his questionable material on Twitter from the 47 accounts he follows that show up in his feed, a curated timeline of tweets that come mostly from his family, celebrities, Fox News hosts and Republican politicians, some of whom in turn follow Twitter accounts that promote QAnon or express anti-Islam or white nationalist views.QAnon-related accounts have potentially migrated to the president's iPhone courtesy of retweets by Donald Trump Jr., the Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo and the conservative commentator Eric Bolling, all of whom Mr. Trump follows. The younger Mr. Trump has also retweeted Russian intelligence operatives pushing divisive stories about immigration and voter fraud.Trolls and fringe elements quickly figured out that the best way to reach Mr. Trump is to appeal to his ego. Last year, an anonymous account with a profile photo of the actor Kurt Russell and posts promoting QAnon tagged Mr. Trump in a tweet, declaring, ""You're the greatest President of my lifetime, Sir."" It was not really Mr. Russell, but Mr. Trump retweeted it with a ""Thank you!,"" helping the account add 2,900 followers that day, before Twitter eventually suspended it.Authentic or not, the most fervent MAGA and QAnon accounts -- at least 23,000 of his followers have QAnon references in their profiles -- form a dependable Greek chorus that exploits the tricks of the medium to amplify the president's message. Mr. Trump benefits from the activism of his online supporters and the platform's algorithms, which tend to reward the most partisan content within digital communities.But the constant exposure to the worst elements of social media poses risks. Clint Watts, a former F.B.I. agent and a cybersecurity expert who studies propaganda campaigns on social media, said the time Mr. Trump spent on Twitter ""gives you an amazing opportunity to game the president.""""You are very clearly capable of using Twitter to entice and influence this president,"" he said. ""You can distort the guy's views from your house.""Since the dawn of the internet, the nation's leaders have been largely sheltered from the storm of disinformation and bile that churns on its fringes. Social media barely existed during Bill Clinton's presidency, George W. Bush's reference to ""the Google"" betrayed his unfamiliarity and Barack Obama chafed at being denied an iPhone but agreed to it.But with the arrival of Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, Twitter managed to connect the ultimate seat of power to the darkest corners of the web for the first time. There is little evidence that Mr. Trump harbors concerns about promoting accounts that traffic in fake or inflammatory material.The White House declined to comment for this article and turned down an interview request with the president. But at a White House ""social media summit"" in July that brought together far-right activists and provocateurs, Mr. Trump expressed appreciation for the fodder he sampled on Twitter.""The crap that you think of,"" he said, ""is unbelievable.""The path to #FakeWhistleblower stretches back to a seminal conspiracy theory in Trump World: #FakeBirthCertificate.Mr. Trump's campaign to sow doubts about Mr. Obama's birthplace, as he was considering running for president himself in 2012, showcased his talent for propagating a useful lie. It also overlapped with his growing presence on Twitter.When his account was created in 2009, the three-year-old platform was just beginning to extend its reach beyond a community of journalists, techies and other early adopters. Over time, as high-profile public figures joined and Twitter allowed for longer messages, its influence grew as a forum for people to comment in real time about live events, world leaders to make official pronouncements and celebrities to interact with fans. Twitter said earlier this year that it had 126 million daily active users.For Mr. Trump, a Twitter account quickly proved useful for promoting himself, sounding off about politics and, eventually, amplifying his attacks on Mr. Obama. By the time he started tweeting the birther smear in November 2011, his fans had already been doing the same, creating memes and hashtags like #FakeBirthCertificate, first used for that purpose in April 2011 by a supporter who cited Mr. Trump in the tweet.After Mr. Trump started tweeting on his own in early 2013 -- he previously had help from an assistant -- he was soon recycling misinformation. He retweeted an anti-Obama account that had tweeted at him, ""The birth certificate that you forced Obama to show is a computer generated forgery."" And he spun conspiracies within conspiracies, tweeting: ""How amazing, the State Health Director who verified copies of Obama's 'birth certificate' died in plane crash today. All others lived.""Mr. Trump's experience using Mr. Obama as a punching bag made him adept at weaponizing what he found on Twitter when he decided to run for president. As his following grew, so did his ability to give prominence to objectionable material and -- intentionally or not -- those responsible for it.In early 2016, he twice retweeted an obscure white supremacist account, @WhiteGenocideTM, that had directed a tweet at him ridiculing Jeb Bush, an opponent in the Republican primary. The since-suspended account, which regularly posted neo-Nazi propaganda and listed its location as ""Jewmerica,"" gained hundreds of followers in the days after Mr. Trump's retweets.By the time he faced off against Hillary Clinton, a perfect storm had coalesced on a more polarized and partisan Twitter -- bringing together activists and trolls practiced at spreading conspiracy theories and hate, and Russian intelligence operatives seeking to foment discord. A how-to manual titled ""Advanced Meme Warfare"" circulated online with instructions for creating material to help the Trump campaign by trashing the Clintons.""The idea is to stack up so much doubt, emotional appeals, and circumstantial evidence ON TOP of facts that we create a landslide of anti-Hill sentiment that permeates through society,"" it said.As memes ricocheted around Twitter, Mr. Trump frequently retweeted them and made use of hashtags like #CrookedHillary. After he won the election, Mr. Trump was asked if he would continue being combative on Twitter once he settled into the White House. In an interview with ""60 Minutes,"" he defended his tweeting as ""nothing you should be ashamed of,"" but pledged to change his tone as president.""I'm going to do very restrained, if I use it at all,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I'm going to do very restrained.""The implications of Mr. Trump's Twitter habit became apparent early in his presidency. In short order, he was railing about ""fake news,"" questioning the findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and peddling the fiction that millions of illegal ballots had cost him the popular vote.Beyond his own tweets, the president stepped up his practice of retweeting others, sharing anti-Muslim videos posted by a British far-right figure who had been retweeted by Ann Coulter. (He later stopped following Ms. Coulter after she criticized him for not making progress on the Mexican border wall.)That episode highlighted one of the ways the president sees information on Twitter. His feed regularly contains tweets from his son, Donald Jr., who follows and retweets alt-right figures like Stefan Molyneux, a Canadian who pushes ""white genocide"" conspiracy theories and has promoted white nationalists on his YouTube channel.The younger Mr. Trump has also followed Lauren Southern, another Canadian right-wing activist who has promoted the ""great replacement"" theory that white populations are being overrun by nonwhite immigrants with the help of global elites. In May, the president retweeted a post in which she complained that far-right voices were being suspended on social media.Six people the president follows -- including Dan Scavino, the White House social media director -- in turn follow Terrence K. Williams, a comedian who has been retweeted by Mr. Trump frequently. Among the retweets was a phony smear claiming that a Muslim congresswoman had partied on the anniversary of Sept. 11, and a conspiracy theory linking the Clintons to the suicide of the imprisoned sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Beyond the people he follows, there is another potential pathway to the president on Twitter -- his ""mentions,"" the surging stream of tweets and replies that are directed at him by tagging his handle.Fake accounts that Twitter identified as being run by foreign intelligence agencies have made frequent use of this tactic to try to get his attention: Russian accounts targeted Mr. Trump with tweets making the false assertion that Russia did not hack the Democratic National Committee's emails. A Chinese account directed a tweet at him calling CNN ""goofy commies."" And an Iranian account heckled him, saying, ""Every morning that American people wakeup, they are nervous about your new tweets.""The odds of his seeing a tagged post amid the deluge are slim, in part because Twitter's algorithms try to screen out objectionable material and his account may employ filters. Some of his Twitter activity is also managed by Mr. Scavino. Still, Mr. Trump spends time looking at tweets that mention him or hashtags that interest him.The content he chooses to retweet is similar to his own: mostly partisan attacks and praise for himself, with occasional inflammatory material mixed in. While it is not always clear whether his retweets are intended to endorse their authors, the president is effectively launching those accounts into the public eye.On St. Patrick's Day last March, while awaiting the conclusion of the Mueller report, Mr. Trump went on a daylong Twitter tirade, batting out more than 30 tweets that appear to have come from extended immersion in the streams flowing through his account.The morning dawned with a 6:01 a.m. barb from Donald Trump Jr. -- ""So many stains on the #GhostofJohnMcCain"" -- presaging several tweets from the president an hour later attacking the deceased senator over old grudges. At the same time, amid a rapidly building flood of mentions, there was a plea directed at him to ""reverse the replacement"" of white people, a tweet from an account with an anti-Semitic name demanding Fox News undo the suspension of the host Jeanine Pirro for anti-Muslim comments, and hundreds of references to QAnon.The president shared a conspiracy-minded post by William Craddick, a right-wing writer who peddled the ""pizzagate"" hoax that Democratic politicians secretly ran a child-trafficking ring out of a Washington pizzeria. ""Russiagate,"" Mr. Craddick wrote, ""was designed in part to help the UK counter Russian influence by baiting the United States into taking a hard line against them."" And Mr. Trump sent out a tweet by Jack Posobiec, another pizzagate promoter, linking to a news story about Latino gang members stabbing and burning a teenager.By nightfall, Mr. Trump had retweeted an obscure QAnon follower who, a few weeks earlier, had pushed the Democratic-pedophilia smear. His retweet of that account -- whose profile image is a stylized ""Q"" wearing a red MAGA hat -- drew notice on the online message boards of 4chan, which were abuzz with speculation that the president had tacitly approved of QAnon theories.The binge ended at 9 p.m., when Mr. Trump tweeted, ""MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""QAnon entered the public consciousness in October 2017, when someone using the code name ""Q"" began posting on 4chan, claiming to have secret knowledge of a conspiracy within a Democrat-controlled ""deep state"" to oust Mr. Trump in a coup.According to Q's groundless theory, Mr. Trump was aware of the plot and was quietly working to unravel it with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, using the Russia investigation as a cover to sweep up the perpetrators through mass arrests. The most extreme adherents of what became known as QAnon -- short for ""Q Anonymous"" -- also postulate that the deep state is part of a global network of corrupt elites involved in Satanism, pedophilia and cannibalism.Remarkably, this conspiracy would migrate from the dark fringes of social media and into conservative political circles, where it took root among a segment of Mr. Trump's most fervent supporters. People holding Q signs have shown up at Trump rallies, and the ""Q"" symbol found its way into a ""Women for Trump"" 2020 campaign video.Last year, two QAnon disciples were arrested in separate episodes, and in May the F.B.I. included QAnon in an intelligence bulletin warning of potential violence stemming from ""anti-government, identity-based and fringe political conspiracy theories,"" particularly as the 2020 election approaches.There are few places where QAnon's visibility has been greater than on Twitter, where Mr. Trump has helped propagate it. Although Mr. Trump does not follow any QAnon-related accounts, some in his Twitter circle do.Bill Mitchell, a conservative podcaster who promotes QAnon, is followed by nine people whom the president follows and has potentially appeared in his feed more than a dozen times. The president has frequently retweeted him, including one post advancing the discredited suggestion that Mr. Obama wiretapped Mr. Trump's phones in 2016.In an email to the Times, Mr. Mitchell said he considered the president's retweets ""a hat-tip without an overt endorsement."" He believes that the president is deliberately provocative on Twitter to keep political enemies off balance and unable to ""think strategically,"" he said.""Through his tweets, President Trump keeps the Democrats and media in a perpetually heightened emotional state, in this case offense and anger,"" he wrote, adding that he respected QAnon's leaders as ""patriots and Trump supporters.""More than 50 accounts that have QAnon references in their profiles -- and dozens more that do not but also promote the conspiracy -- appeared among those followed by Donald Trump Jr.; Ms. Bartiromo; Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee; Katrina Pierson, a Trump campaign adviser; Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio; and a handful of others who are all, in turn, followed by the president.There is no indication that these people, who collectively follow thousands of accounts, are aware of the QAnon presence that lurks there, much less support it.But the potential for QAnon accounts to appear in the presidential feed underscores the viral nature of disinformation on Twitter, where a tweet can hatch on the fringes, hopscotch through layers of accounts and, aided by hashtags and bots, gain wide currency.On Thursday evening, a QAnon promoter tweeted an unsubstantiated yarn that years ago he overheard a key witness in the impeachment inquiry bad-mouthing America and talking up ""Obama & globalism."" QAnon accounts passed it around, and by the next morning it had been retweeted by Mr. Posobiec, who in turn was retweeted by Donald Trump Jr. -- in less than 24 hours, the story had wormed its way into the president's Twitter circle.And it has happened before. During a busy Sunday morning of tweeting in August, Ms. Bartiromo retweeted an anonymous account called @QBlueSkyQ that had posted a series of conspiratorial messages about the Russia investigation, along with a video snippet of her Fox interview with George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign aide arrested in the scandal.Even a glance at @QBlueSkyQ's profile would have revealed that it was a die-hard QAnon account. It has tweeted doctored images and fake memes promoting a falsehood that top Democrats sexually torture children to harvest adrenochrome -- a chemical derived from adrenaline -- for a life-extending elixir. The @QBlueSkyQ retweet was one of at least a half-dozen times Ms. Bartiromo helped circulate such accounts, though none of the posts dealt with the QAnon conspiracy directly. Ms. Bartiromo declined to comment.QAnon accounts have also been retweeted by Mr. Bolling, a former Fox News commentator. Mr. Bolling said that he had no idea any account he retweeted was connected to QAnon, and that it was unfair to expect him to ""vet every account that I retweet.""""I wouldn't have done it had I known,"" he said. ""I have nothing to do with QAnon.""Mr. Bolling retweeted an anonymous QAnon account called @K12Lioness several times, most of it partisan political material and all unrelated to the Q conspiracy. But in between the run-of-the-mill tweets that caught his attention, the account was also pumping out vile memes and messages from the deepest fringes of the QAnon universe, like this post in June:""The Democrats have lost their minds (adrenochrome) eating baby parts. MY GOD Americans WAKE UP!!""Mr. Trump was two weeks from his inauguration in January 2017 when he tweeted, ""So how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers?""It would be the start of a relentless campaign, continuing to the present, to dispute that the Russians interfered in the 2016 election. Eventually, the narrative would merge with another -- that Mr. Biden intervened in Ukraine to protect his son's business interests -- in the now-infamous phone call in which Mr. Trump pressed Ukraine's president to search for the D.N.C.'s email server, implying without evidence that it was somewhere in his country.That effort began within days of Mr. Biden's official campaign announcement in April, when a Trump supporter tweeted a meme of Mr. Biden with the words, ""China & Ukraine, Quid Pro Joe."" The post prompted another Trump fan to put a hashtag to use: #QuidProJoe. The #QuidProJoe and #FakeWhistleblower hashtags had both been created years earlier for issues unrelated to Mr. Biden and Ukraine, but were dusted off and put into service by Trump supporters.The #QuidProJoe hashtag remained relatively dormant until a few weeks later, when it was retweeted seven times by a pro-Trump, bot-like account that cranks out more than 100 tweets a day, including QAnon and fervent anti-Democratic material. The hashtag steadily gained currency, and by September, when news erupted of the whistle-blower complaint filed a month earlier, it was part of a growing arsenal of social media tools seized on by Mr. Trump's supporters, including Donald Jr.A slew of hashtags -- nearly all of them created by anonymous, unverified accounts, some connected to QAnon -- have been deployed on Twitter in recent months attacking the impeachment inquiry, and in particular Representative Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who leads the House Intelligence Committee. Many have crude names, like #LyingSackOfSchiff, #SchiffForBrains and #FullOfSchiff.So far, none of those hashtags has gotten a presidential tweet. But every day, Mr. Trump offers his Twitter fans reason for hope.On Oct. 19, between tweeting ""Shifty Schiff is Corrupt"" and retweeting an anonymous account that regularly traffics in alt-right and Russian propaganda, the president tweeted out a fresh hashtag being pushed by his supporters: #StopTheCoup.Twitter went wild.Rich Harris contributed reporting.

| Jump to first hitThe former vice president's backers have noted a lack of enthusiasm and a spotty campaign operation as reasons Joe Biden is lagging in Iowa, not to mention a formidable moderate competitor in Pete Buttigieg.WINTERSET, Iowa -- Nancy Courtney displays a Joe Biden sign in her yard, makes phone calls for his campaign and supports the former vice president ""100 percent,"" she said. But the sluggish state of Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s organization in her city of Burlington, Iowa, had her fuming one recent evening.""In Burlington, they are duds,"" said Ms. Courtney, an activist who is married to the Democratic chairman in Des Moines County. ""I will help, but there's no excitement there. There's nothing. I will do whatever it takes to get him elected, but I can't go down there when there's nothing going on.""Bob Kling, a city councilman in Indianola, just south of Des Moines, was promoted by the Biden campaign as a prominent local endorser. But asked about Mr. Biden's standing in his state, Mr. Kling was blunt: ""Not as great as he was. Buttigieg is kind of taking the lead in the polls,"" he said, referring to Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind.Since late summer, Mr. Biden, the early front-runner in the Democratic primary, has faced an increasingly difficult path in Iowa -- dropping in the polls and struggling with an enthusiasm gap and an inclination among undecided caucusgoers to consider all options. Now, 10 weeks before the Iowa caucuses, even his own supporters in the state are growing more worried about his prospects.The heightened anxiety comes as the candidate and campaign are raising expectations, through new investments of time and resources, about his ability to compete here, an implicit acknowledgment that a substantial loss could be a significant early setback.On Sunday, his campaign sent a fund-raising email that said, ""we need to play to win in Iowa,"" the latest, in the last week, in a barrage of fund-raising emails that focus on the state. And on Saturday Mr. Biden declared that he would win the caucuses as he accepted highly coveted endorsements from former Gov. Tom Vilsack and his wife, Christie Vilsack, a prominent party leader.The emphasis is a striking departure from the messaging earlier in the fall, when his campaign repeatedly suggested he did not need to win the state to secure the Democratic nomination.Yet voters at Mr. Biden's events, along with county chairs and party strategists, characterize his on-the-ground organization as scattershot, visibly present in some counties but barely detectable in others. His events are often relatively small and sometimes subdued affairs, and in a state where enthusiasm can make or break a candidate on caucus night -- a big part of caucusing centers on persuading friends and neighbors -- Mr. Biden's operation has found it difficult to build contagious excitement, these Democrats say.There is also the sense among many Iowa Democrats that Mr. Biden, who entered the race later than many of his rivals, has been less engaged in the state than his top rivals. He has made roughly 50 stops in Iowa since joining the race in April, according to the Des Moines Register's candidate tracker, far fewer than many of his opponents.""This is prime political season in Iowa and most candidates are spending a good deal of time visiting Iowa,"" said Joey Norris, the Democratic chair in Montgomery County, Iowa, where Mr. Buttigieg plans to campaign on Monday. ""The Biden campaign has been notably absent.""Now, Mr. Biden's campaign is racing to improve his standing in the state -- hosting several campaign events with the Vilsacks over the weekend, and planning an eight-day swing by bus through the state after Thanksgiving and a return later in December.Mr. Biden's team argues that his presence in the state is comparable to that of his rivals: The campaign claims 26 offices across the state, more than 100 staff members, and it plans to continue adding staff and resources. Senator Elizabeth Warren's campaign claims more than 20 offices, and Mr. Buttigieg's has 29 with more to come; both cite roughly the same number of paid staffers as Mr. Biden.Mr. Biden's bus tour is expected to include both town hall-style events and activities with volunteers and precinct captains, like visits to phone banks and perhaps some door knocking. The counties he will visit, many of them largely rural, are home to working-class voters who often connect with Mr. Biden, and Mr. Biden will need to overperform in those areas on Feb. 3. The campaign is also closely focused on ensuring Mr. Biden hits the threshold for accruing delegates across the state.""We need to candidly be able to keep pace, we feel like we're going to be able to do that,"" Pete Kavanaugh, Mr. Biden's deputy campaign manager, said. ""You can tell where campaigns are focusing based on where their candidates are. And, you know, we're going to have a pretty heavy schedule here in December, starting with the bus tour and heading into January and February.""Mr. Biden's team argues that the former vice president, who is stronger in later-voting and more diverse states, has been trying hard to prevail in Iowa but also sees multiple paths to the nomination. Still, some advisers and allies are aware that a poor showing in Iowa could be crushing to a campaign that is premised on the notion that Mr. Biden is the most electable candidate against President Trump. Because New Hampshire, which follows Iowa in the primary calendar, historically favors candidates from neighboring states, the pressure is on here.Mr. Buttigieg presents an immediate threat to Mr. Biden. While polls show him struggling with voters of color in later-voting states, in Iowa he draws supporters among moderates who like Mr. Biden but worry about his age, his tendency to misspeak and his uneven debate performances. And because of a cash crunch this fall, Mr. Biden was off the Iowa airwaves for weeks while Mr. Buttigieg, flush with cash, blanketed them with ads.The Biden campaign says it has now reserved around $4 million in airtime through the caucuses and will likely add more.Mr. Biden's diminished standing here was highlighted in a recent Des Moines Register/CNN poll, which showed Mr. Biden with 15 percent support -- far behind Mr. Buttigieg and effectively tied with Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.A pro-Biden super PAC, which has conducted polling in Iowa and plans to soon start running ads here, recently conducted focus groups in the state -- and it was apparent Mr. Buttigieg's ads had broken through to participants, according to a person familiar with the super PAC's activities.Jordan Miller, 33, drove about an hour from Des Moines to Winterset to see Mr. Biden Friday night. Ms. Miller, a waitress, supported President Barack Obama before flipping to President Trump in 2016 -- and Mr. Biden is assiduously courting those voters. But after the event, she said Mr. Buttigieg was her first choice.""With Biden, he does a really great job speaking with crowds like this,"" she said of the small venue. ""I'm not impressed with him in the debates. He stumbles.""The Biden campaign sees the Iowa contest as fluid and uncertain, and his allies note that Mr. Buttigieg, now a polling leader for the first time, has not yet faced the sustained scrutiny that Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren have.As he endorsed Mr. Biden at a Des Moines rally, Mr. Vilsack cited Mr. Biden's experience and cast him as an empathetic figure who can connect in critical general election battleground states.""Here's why,"" said Mr. Vilsack, who along with his wife supported Mr. Biden's first presidential bid in the 1988 campaign. ""Because we know him. We like him. Why is it that we know him and like him? Because he's a middle-class guy.""""His success wasn't built on daddy's money,"" he added to applause.In the recent Register poll, 52 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers said they were almost certain or fairly confident that Mr. Biden would beat Mr. Trump in the general election.And party officials often hark back to 2004 -- a year in which there was also a Republican incumbent -- when Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, a staid moderate, prevailed in the caucuses despite signs in the months before that Howard Dean, the feisty former governor of Vermont, was surging.""He has a lot of supporters who have said things to me like, 'My heart is with Booker but my head is with Biden,""' said Peter Leo, the Democratic chair in rural Carroll County.Mr. Leo, who has endorsed Ms. Warren, said Mr. Biden's field office in his county is ""right on the main drag,"" which increases the campaign's visibility. ""On the ground what that looks like to me is he's got staff working, he's got volunteers working,"" Mr. Leo said.His remarks underscore how uneven Mr. Biden's campaign is across the state. In some places, like Dubuque County, his operation has expanded in recent weeks.But in others, like Wapello County, a blue-collar region in southeastern Iowa, some party officials say Mr. Biden's campaign has a more modest presence. ""I'm very confused by how small the Biden field operation is in this part of the state,"" said Zach Simonson, the Democratic chair in Wapello County. ""It's very much his kind of turf.""Dan Callahan, the Democratic chair in Buchanan County, said he expected Mr. Biden to finish in the top three in the state but suggested that his support had stagnated, in part because he can appear ""unfocused and less energetic"" when he goes off script at events.""Part of Biden's problem is that we have so many options to choose from,"" Mr. Callahan said. ""His followers are dedicated but he isn't attracting new voters like some of the other candidates.""Many of Mr. Biden's supporters find his speaking style authentic and relatable -- but his tendency to misspeak led to some confusing guidance for Iowans at an event in Dubuque last month.""I'm asking you to take a look -- I'm asking for your help,"" Mr. Biden said. ""Commit to caucusing for me on February the fourth.""The caucuses are scheduled for the previous day.PhotographMr. Biden has made about 50 stops in Iowa since April, far fewer than many of his opponents.

| Jump to first hitORLANDO, Fla. -- President Trump on Thursday delivered a campaign-style speech to an audience of elderly voters, pitching a new executive order that aims to improve private Medicare plans as the responsible alternative to the ""Medicare for all"" policies supported by some of his Democratic political opponents.""Standing in solidarity with our nation's seniors, I declare once again that America will never be a socialist country,"" Mr. Trump told a crowd at the Villages in Florida, the country's largest retirement community, where the population is overwhelmingly white and conservative and where many residents are veterans.""Democrat health care proposals would put everyone into a single socialist government program"" and end private insurance for all Americans, Mr. Trump told the supportive crowd.While the Medicare for All Act proposed by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont would indeed cover all Americans under a single national health insurance program, most of the other Democratic presidential candidates want to give people the option of buying into Medicare, or a similar ""public option,"" but do not require it.[ Medicare for All? For More? Here's How Medicare Works. ]That did not stop Mr. Trump from pitching himself in a critical swing state as the bulwark against a raid on health care benefits that members of his audience rely on. ""As long as I'm president, no one will lay a hand on your Medicare benefits,"" Mr. Trump said, adding that ""I will never allow these politicians to steal your health care and give it away to illegal immigrants.""Nearly all the Democratic candidates have said they support granting government health coverage to undocumented immigrants. At a debate in June, the idea received a unanimous show of hands in support.But while Mr. Trump's speech suggested that the Democratic proposals for expanding coverage put retirees' access to health care in grave danger, the plans would not actually diminish their benefits. The Sanders plan, for example, would eliminate Medicare but provide more benefits for all Americans, including the elderly, than the program currently offers. It would have lower out-of-pocket costs compared with Medicare, though it would increase taxes.Mr. Trump's speech, delivered from behind a lectern with a presidential seal, was billed as an official White House event and his travel was not paid for by his campaign. But it was almost indistinguishable in much of its content from the remarks Mr. Trump delivers at his ""Make America Great Again"" rallies.Mr. Trump called the Democratic presidential field a bunch of ""maniacs"" and noted that Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, whom he referred to by the pejorative nickname Pocahontas, ""came up from the ashes."" He noted that he would have to knock her out of the running again ""because I don't see sleepy Joe Biden making it.""Mr. Trump said his victory in the 2020 election was critical to preventing the country from being hijacked by the ""radical left,"" which he said was ""consumed by rage and radicalism and insatiable lust."" And he said that House Democrats had begun impeachment proceedings because ""they know they can't beat us fairly.""Mr. Trump's advisers earlier in the day previewed the new executive order as part of Mr. Trump's commitment to protecting Medicare. Seniors ""like what they have, so the president is going to protect it,"" Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, said in a conference call with reporters. Mr. Azar also used the call to frame Democrats' health care plan as too focused on reducing the ranks of the uninsured.The executive order seeks to beef up Medicare Advantage, the plans offered by private insurers that contract with Medicare and currently cover about a third of the program's 60 million beneficiaries, according to senior administration officials. The order also calls for lowering Medicare Advantage's premiums, allowing providers to spend more time with patients and reducing Medicare fraud.The executive order, originally called ""Protecting Medicare From Socialist Destruction,"" was renamed ""Protecting and Improving Medicare for Our Nation's Seniors"" before Mr. Trump's speech. But administration officials said the renaming was a distinction without a difference.Joe Grogan, the director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, said the goal was still to contrast the administration's commitment to protecting seniors with ""the vision for Medicare as a one-size-fits-all, single-payer system"" supported by many Democratic candidates.""Medicare for all is Medicare for none,"" added Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, who has been a vocal critic not just of the Democratic proposals but also of the Affordable Care Act. ""Proposals like Medicare for all, as well as the public option, they are morally wrong because they would demote American seniors to second-class status.""Democrats competing for their party's presidential nomination strongly disagree: All advocate expanding health care coverage, though their strategies to do so vary.Mr. Trump's appearance in a Republican-leaning region of Florida reflects the judgment of advisers who see health care, in recent years a Democratic issue, as a better focus for the president than the impeachment proceedings underway on Capitol Hill. And they see it as a way of tying all the Democratic candidates to the most progressive wing of the party and branding them as socialists.Since his attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act ended in failure, Mr. Trump has repeatedly promised to unveil a new health care plan. Instead he has issued a series of executive orders and proposed rules to counter Democratic health care proposals for expanding coverage.In July, for instance, the administration said it was taking steps to make it easier to import some drugs from Canada and to force hospitals to disclose the discounted prices they negotiate with insurers.Administration officials on Thursday morning underscored what has become a frequent talking point for Mr. Trump: that the price of prescription drugs fell in 2018 for the first time in decades.But that claim is misleading. While the Consumer Price Index for prescription drugs declined in 2018, many experts say that is too narrow a measurement and that prices for many drugs, especially brand-name ones, have continued to rise.Mr. Trump appeared at ease in front of a supportive audience.""I should be retiring with you,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I should be in this audience, clapping. But I didn't trust anybody to be standing here, because I know what you have.""PhotographPresident Trump's speech was billed as an official White House event, but much of it was almost indistinguishable from the remarks Mr. Trump delivers at his rallies.

| Jump to first hitThe top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee called the reports that he met with a former Ukrainian prosecutor part of a criminal campaign against him by a ""totally corrupt"" news media.WASHINGTON -- Representative Devin Nunes, an outspoken defender of President Trump in his impeachment hearings, said on Sunday that reports that he played a role in the effort to dig up damaging information on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Ukraine were part of a criminal campaign against him by a ""totally corrupt"" news media.The reports, including most prominently one from CNN on Friday, nonetheless put Mr. Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, in the middle of a new controversy at a key moment in the inquiry into Mr. Trump's pressure campaign on Ukraine.According to the reports, Lev Parnas, who worked on the Ukraine pressure campaign with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, said through his lawyer that he had learned of a meeting in Vienna in 2018 between Mr. Nunes and Viktor Shokin, the former Ukrainian prosecutor general who has emerged as a key figure in Republican attacks on Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Mr. Parnas, who has been indicted on campaign finance charges in Manhattan, learned of the meeting from Mr. Shokin, his lawyer said.Neither Mr. Shokin nor Mr. Nunes has confirmed that the meeting happened, and Mr. Parnas has no direct knowledge of what may have been discussed. But Mr. Shokin had falsely suggested that he was ousted under pressure from Vice President Biden because he was investigating a company where Hunter Biden was a director, and he has subsequently made claims about the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, aligning him with Mr. Trump.Mr. Nunes on Sunday refused to directly answer whether he met with Mr. Shokin, instead replying that he wanted to offer a rebuttal but could not yet do so, citing the news media's ""criminal activity"" in ""listening to somebody who's been indicted.""""Everybody's going to know all the facts, but I think you can understand, I can't compete by trying to debate this out with the public media when 90 percent of the media are totally corrupt,"" he said on Fox News's ""Sunday Morning Futures.""Mr. Nunes later added after an extended back and forth that the reports were ""demonstrably false"" and he would ""get to all the facts"" after he filed a lawsuit against CNN.Mr. Parnas also met personally with one of Mr. Nunes's aides at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, according to Mr. Parnas's lawyer, Joseph A. Bondy. The aide joined at least one meeting there to discuss the effort to collect negative information on the Bidens, Mr. Bondy said. Mr. Nunes did not address that report on Sunday.Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, declined on Sunday to say whether he found the reports credible or whether the House should investigate. But he noted that they could potentially prompt an ethics investigation.""If he was on a taxpayer-funded codel -- and I say 'if' -- seeking dirt on a potential Democratic candidate for president, Joe Biden, that will be an ethics matter,"" Mr. Schiff said, using an abbreviation for congressional delegation. ""That is not before our committee.""Mr. Giuliani rejected his former associate's claim on Saturday, telling Fox News that he did not believe Mr. Nunes met with Mr. Shokin.""Poor Lev, I don't know what he's doing to himself,"" Mr. Giuliani said. ""I think, once again, that's going to be shown to be provably untrue. This is the first I would have heard of that. I think I would have heard of it, if it happened.""Still, Mr. Giuliani argued that it ""would have been"" Mr. Nunes's ""duty"" to meet with Mr. Shokin to unearth relevant evidence of corruption in Ukraine.Mr. Nunes has previously shown a willingness to jump into the fray of investigations to defend Mr. Trump. As the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Mr. Nunes in 2017 stepped aside from his panel's investigation into Russia's efforts to disrupt the 2016 presidential election after the House Ethics Committee opened an investigation into whether he disclosed classified information to the White House.He was eventually cleared of wrongdoing in that matter. But he continued to be dogged by criticism that he was too close to Mr. Trump to run an impartial investigation, following reports that a claim that Mr. Nunes trumpeted -- that the president or his closest associates may have been swept up in foreign surveillance by American spy agencies -- was actually fed to him by White House officials.A former committee staff member for Mr. Nunes, Kashyap Patel, who played a key role in helping Republicans try to undermine the Russia investigation, also has emerged as a figure in the Ukraine matter in recent months. Now an aide on the National Security Council, House impeachment investigators are scrutinizing any role he played in the shadow foreign policy Mr. Trump was conducting as he pushed the Ukrainian government to announce investigations into his political rivals.Mr. Patel has responded to some of the reports about his role shepherding the administration's Ukraine policy by joining a defamation lawsuit against a handful of news organizations led by Mr. Nunes, his former boss.Republicans have also begun their own investigation into the Bidens. Last week, Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who heads the Judiciary Committee, requested documents from the State Department related to the former vice president's communications with Ukrainian officials.Ben Protess and Chris Cameron contributed reporting.Ben Protess and Chris Cameron contributed reporting.PhotographRepresentative Devin Nunes said that he wanted to rebut reports that he played a role in the effort to dig up dirt on the Bidens but could not yet do so, citing the news media's ""criminal activity.""

| Jump to first hitDemocrats in Battleground States Prefer Moderate Nominee, Poll ShowsWASHINGTON -- Democrats in the country's most pivotal general election battlegrounds prefer a moderate presidential nominee who would seek common ground with Republicans rather than pursue an ambitious, progressive agenda, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll of primary voters across six states.As the Democratic candidates intensify their argument over how best to defeat President Trump, their core voters in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona and Florida are counseling them to pursue a political middle ground.A majority of those surveyed said they wanted a Democratic nominee who is more moderate than most Democrats, and they overwhelmingly preferred one who would bridge the partisan divide in Washington.The party's voters are more evenly split on the scale of change they are seeking from their nominee: 49 percent said they preferred a candidate who would return politics in Washington to normal, while 45 percent hope for one who will bring fundamental change to American society.The poll showed a top tier of three candidates in the battleground states: Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Mr. Biden was leading in five of the six states, while Ms. Warren enjoyed a narrow advantage within the margin of error in Wisconsin, where Mr. Sanders also appeared strong. No other candidate registered in double digits in any of the states surveyed.While Democrats have unambiguously moved to the left in the decade since President Barack Obama took office, as Republicans eagerly point out, the poll illustrates that the party's identity is more complex than the opposition and some progressive activists would portray it.Democratic voters in the six states, each of which Mr. Trump carried three years ago, are split almost equally in how they described themselves ideologically: 49 percent say they are moderate or conservative, while 48 percent indicate they are very liberal or somewhat liberal.And this presidential primary reflects the party's contrasting impulses.Primary voters who long for a moderate standard-bearer and a return to normalcy in Washington strongly prefer Mr. Biden, according to the survey. Those Democrats who prefer a progressive nominee and want them to fight for a bold agenda while bringing systemic change to American society are nearly evenly divided between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren.The divisions go beyond ideology and ambition: Older, nonwhite Democrats and those without college degrees strongly favor Mr. Biden. But younger Democrats of all races prefer Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, while those with college degrees overwhelmingly prefer Ms. Warren.None of the six states where voters were polled are casting ballots in the first stage of the primary next year, and only North Carolina votes on Super Tuesday, in early March, immediately after the initial early-voting states. So the candidate preferences could change by the time these states hold their nominating contests.The Times/Siena survey of 1,568 Democratic primary voters in the six states was conducted from Oct. 13 to 26. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points. Sampling error in individual states is higher.In preferences for individual candidates, the major distinction between the six states and Iowa, where The Times and Siena polled caucusgoers late last month, is that Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., is in the top tier with Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders in Iowa. But he has scant support in the battleground states and despite winning a wave of attention in recent months, he was one of several candidates to poll at zero percent among black voters in those states.The ideological and generational divisions shaping this primary are strikingly similar in the Iowa and battleground surveys. Mr. Biden has nearly three times the support from voters over 65 that he does among those 29 and younger. And he does three times better among self-described moderates and conservatives than he does among those who say they are very liberal.The former vice president's support from older voters is especially pronounced among nonwhite Democrats. Nearly half of the racial minorities surveyed who were 45 and older backed Mr. Biden, while Mr. Sanders received 10 percent and Ms. Warren 9 percent.What's more ominous for Mr. Biden is that his support with younger nonwhite voters is far more tenuous: Among racial minorities under 45, Mr. Sanders was the favorite at 28 percent, followed by Ms. Warren at 19 percent and Mr. Biden at only 11 percent.Xiomara Alarcon, a 24-year-old postal worker from Greensboro, N.C., described Mr. Sanders as ""pure-hearted,"" a true-believing advocate for progressive policies like ""Medicare for all."" She also approvingly noted that he was arrested as a young activist in 1963.""He fights for all people of color,"" said Ms. Alarcon, who identifies as Hispanic. ""Not just himself and his people.""Among African-American voters of all ages in the six states, Mr. Biden was the overwhelming favorite, receiving 42 percent of that vote. Ms. Warren captured 13 percent, and Mr. Sanders had 10 percent.That finding aligns with other polling through the year that reinforces Mr. Biden's high standing with black voters, forged through ties with congressional and community leaders, and most significantly, through his relationship with former President Obama.""He was Obama's vice president and some of the things Obama supported, he supported,"" Michael Elliott, 61, of Jacksonville, Fla., said of Mr. Biden. ""Vice president, that's as close as you can get to being a president. I'm looking at experience, too.""Nearly 300 miles down the Florida coast, William Stewart, 39, raised concerns about Mr. Biden's ability to appeal to younger voters and said he was currently supporting Ms. Warren.""It would be great for a woman to be president,"" said Mr. Stewart, of West Palm Beach. Mr. Stewart, a logistics manager, identifies as African-American. ""I believe in some of the thoughts she has about health care and equal rights for everybody.""As for Mr. Biden, he said, ""I have a little reservation about if he's connecting with the younger people.""Ms. Warren was strongest among voters who identified as ""very liberal,"" winning 35 percent, while Mr. Biden captured just 13 percent of those voters. She also dominated with white college graduates, capturing 33 percent, far more than Mr. Biden or Mr. Sanders.Mr. Biden was strongest among white voters without a four-year degree, taking 30 percent -- double Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, who both captured 15 percent of these voters.""Joe Biden has the experience,"" said Diane Ethridge, 60, of Green Bay, Wis. ""I also think he's more willing to listen and he will do far better with trade with this country, he will do far better, I think also even in the Democratic Party, with health care.""Ms. Ethridge, who attended vocational school and worked at a phone company, said she opposed Medicare for all and efforts to make college free, proposals supported in various forms by Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders.""She's doing well in the polls,"" she said of Ms. Warren, ""but I am not for her political platform of Medicare for all. I don't know where this money is going to be coming from. I am not in favor of education for all, either. I don't feel we should be paying for someone who could afford to pay for it.""

Even some of Ms. Warren's supporters expressed concerns about the practical and political considerations of her Medicare for all plan.Ms. Warren has said her proposal will not raise taxes on the middle class. Last Friday she unveiled a plan describing how she would pay for an initiative that she says would cost $20.5 trillion in new federal spending over a decade.""I'm very skeptical"" about the tax implications, Mr. Stewart, of Florida, said. ""That's the only discrepancy. I don't know how it's possible.""PhotographWord count: 1274Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hitBefore issuing his own condolences, the president channeled the Saudi king's, and avoided any discussion of the hard questions about why the U.S. is training Saudi officers.FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- When a Saudi Air Force officer opened fire on his classmates at a naval base in Pensacola, Fla., on Friday, he killed three, wounded eight and exposed anew the strange dynamic between President Trump and the Saudi leadership: The president's first instinct was to tamp down any suggestion that the Saudi government needed to be held to account.Hours later, Mr. Trump announced on Twitter that he had received a condolence call from King Salman of Saudi Arabia, who clearly sought to ensure that the episode did not further fracture their relationship. On Saturday, leaving the White House for a trip here for a Republican fund-raiser and a speech on Israeli-American relations, Mr. Trump told reporters that ""they are devastated in Saudi Arabia,"" noting that ""the king will be involved in taking care of families and loved ones."" He never used the word ""terrorism.""What was missing was any assurance that the Saudis would aid in the investigation, help identify the suspect's motives, or answer the many questions about the vetting process for a coveted slot at one of the country's premier schools for training allied officers. Or, more broadly, why the United States continues to train members of the Saudi military even as that same military faces credible accusations of repeated human rights abuses in Yemen, including the dropping of munitions that maximize civilian casualties.""The attack is a disaster for an already deeply strained relationship,"" Bruce Riedel, a scholar at the Brookings Institution and a former C.I.A. officer who has dealt with generations of Saudi leaders, said on Saturday. It ""focuses attention on Americans training Saudi Air Force officers who are engaged in numerous bombings of innocents in Yemen, which is the worst humanitarian catastrophe in the world,"" he said, noting that the Trump administration had long been fighting Congress as it seeks to end American support for that war.But even stranger, said Mr. Riedel, was ""the president's parroting of the Saudi line"" before learning the results of an investigation into whether the gunman acted alone, or had allegiances to Al Qaeda or terrorist groups.For the White House, the calculus is simple: Saudi Arabia is not only critical to world oil supplies -- though no longer critical to the United States' -- it is the only regional power able to counter Iran. The result, former members of the Trump administration say, has been a dismissal of any critiques that could weaken that bond.Mr. Trump was so quick and so eager to assure the Saudis that the relationship would continue before anyone knew how to categorize the shooting that it raised questions about how the administration would have responded if the suspect had been an Iranian, or an immigrant from Mexico. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump often cited the killing of a young woman in California by an undocumented immigrant as a reason to crack down on immigration and build a wall along the southern border.""Had an attack been carried out by any country on his Muslim ban, his reaction would have been very different,"" said Aaron David Miller, a longtime Middle East negotiator and now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.""But when it comes to Saudi, the default position is to defend,"" he said, ""Driven by oil, money, weapons sales, a good deal of Saudi feting and flattery, Trump has created a virtually impenetrable zone of immunity for Saudi Arabia.""It was hardly the first time Mr. Trump had shown such tendencies. After the brutal killing in Istanbul of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi dissident and a legal American resident, Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo played down American intelligence findings that closely tied Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, to the matter. The findings suggested he had connections to the members of the hit team sent to Turkey -- and almost certainly played a role in ordering them to bring Mr. Khashoggi back to the country by force.Mr. Trump's and Mr. Pompeo's initial promises to follow the evidence wherever it led dissipated. Over the past year, Mr. Pompeo has expressed deep annoyance whenever the topic is raised. The United States was awaiting the results of a Saudi investigation, he often said, as if he expected that to offer a full accounting. And he told members of Congress that no matter the truth of what unfolded, the relationship between the kingdom and Washington was too important to be held hostage to one vicious, ill-thought-out act.No American assessment of what the Saudi leadership knew has ever been made public.Before the shooting on Friday, the White House was already fighting efforts in Congress to cut military aid to the Saudis, a reflection of anger over the Khashoggi murder and continuing war in Yemen. But the Pensacola attack underlined the continuing instinct to protect the relationship.""If Trump wants to convey condolences from Saudi King Salman, fine,"" Mr. Miller wrote on Twitter after the shooting. ""But you don't do it on day -- Americans are killed -- untethered from a message of ironclad assurances from King to provide"" whatever cooperation is necessary to understand the gunman and his motives. ""Otherwise Trump sounds like what he has become -- a Saudi apologist.""After Mr. Pompeo announced that he had spoken with the Saudi foreign minister, Faisal bin Farhan al-Saud, about the shooting, Martin Indyk, a former American ambassador to Israel and longtime Middle East negotiator, tweeted: ""Isn't it interesting how quick Trump and Pompeo are to broadcast Saudi government condolences for the murder of three Americans and how slow they were to criticize the Saudi government's murder"" of Mr. Khashoggi.Still, the bond between the countries is weakening, as the erosion of support in Congress shows. A negotiation over providing nuclear technology to the Saudis, a huge push early in the administration, has stalled. The chances that the military support will remain at current levels appear slim.""The U.S.-Saudi relationship is on life support,"" Mr. Riedel said, noting that it would be in jeopardy if a Democrat were to win the 2020 election. ""Even Joe Biden is calling the Kingdom a 'pariah' that needs to be punished,"" he said, referring to the former vice president, who had for decades supported a strong relationship with the Saudis.PhotographPresident Trump's first instinct was to tamp down any suggestion that the Saudi government needed to be held accountable for any misdeeds.

| Jump to first hitIn the last three months, Bernie Sanders raised $25.3 million. Pete Buttigieg raised $19.1 million and Kamala Harris $11.6 million, at a time when donations signal viability.Senator Bernie Sanders has produced the biggest fund-raising quarter of the Democratic primary, as his campaign announced on Tuesday that he had taken in $25.3 million over the last three months. Now the big questions looming over the donor race are whether Senator Elizabeth Warren will surpass him, and whether former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will trail far behind.Mr. Sanders's third quarter haul is the latest demonstration of the rising power of small donors to reshape presidential politics. His campaign moved swiftly on Tuesday to assert his financial might, reserving his first television ads of the campaign -- a two-week, $1.3 million buy in Iowa.Yet President Trump displayed fund-raising might that far surpassed any of the Democrats. Republican Party officials said that his re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee had raised $125 million over the last three months, a presidential fund-raising record.Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren have yet to share their much-anticipated totals. But Ms. Warren's figure is prompting much speculation; she is widely expected to improve upon the $19 million that she raised last quarter as she has surged in the polls to become Mr. Biden's leading rival.The expectations game is perhaps most fraught for Mr. Biden, whose efforts to fashion himself as the clear front-runner mean that any slippage from the top of the ranks represents a risk.Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have boycotted the big-money circuit, raising the possibility of a watershed moment: The two top fund-raisers in the Democratic Party might end up being candidates who have turned their backs on the established class of political bundlers and financiers who have held sway for decades.The third quarter is known as perhaps the toughest to raise money in, as big donors are often out of town vacationing in July and August while small contributors spend less time online in the summer. But the money totals are critical not only to set budgets, hire staff and run ads but also because they mark the last time in 2019 that campaigns must open their books, hardening public perception of viability -- or lack of it -- during a crucial three-month period.The quarter ended on Monday and campaigns have until Oct. 15 to share their financial figures. Those without enough money can be winnowed quickly from the field; a half-dozen Democratic candidates have already called it quits this year.""It dictates the narrative in the lead-up to the elections,"" said Rufus Gifford, who served as finance director for President Barack Obama's re-election campaign and has donated to multiple 2020 candidates. ""The big game that's going on inside the campaigns is how to manage expectations.""The string of fund-raising announcements began early Tuesday morning with Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who announced that he had raised $19.1 million in the third quarter. It was a dip from the field-leading $24.9 million he posted in the previous quarter, but more than enough to fully fund his once-upstart campaign into this fall and winter. Mr. Buttigieg has developed a grass-roots following, pairing his 580,000 donors with an aggressive calendar of dozens of traditional fund-raising events.Senator Kamala Harris announced an $11.6 million haul -- nearly matching her totals in the first two quarters. She was the only campaign to announce her cash on hand: nearly $10 million, down from $13.3 million at the end of June, meaning she spent more than she raised in the last three months.Mr. Biden raised $22 million in the last quarter, second to Mr. Buttigieg. But there are signs his fund-raising operation has slowed, particularly online, where Mr. Biden has slashed his advertising budget.While Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders did not have to fill their calendars with fund-raisers, Mr. Biden raced across the country in the last three months, from Florida to California, Aspen to the Hamptons, holding more than 40 donor events. His wife, Dr. Jill Biden, headlined another dozen.This weekend, top Biden donors and bundlers have been invited to a retreat in Philadelphia to discuss the campaign's next phase.Mr. Biden's campaign has said he scored his best week of fund-raising since the second week of the campaign as Democrats initiated an impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump over a whistle-blower complaint claiming that Mr. Trump prodded the president of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings there of Mr. Biden's son Hunter Biden.Still, some Biden supporters are nervous about how the impeachment process, and any added scrutiny of Hunter Biden's business affairs, will play out. Some have even discussed creating a super PAC, which the campaign quickly disavowed. Others see in Ms. Warren's rise as a top rival, with Mr. Sanders in third, an opportunity for Mr. Biden to truly consolidate a donor class that has remained fractured.Mr. Biden's ability to attract small donors will be closely scrutinized. In the last 90 days, his campaign ranked 10th among the Democratic presidential candidates for advertising dollars on Facebook, where campaigns often prospect for new contributors. He spent less than one-quarter of what Mr. Buttigieg had spent on the platform in that time, and well less than half of what Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders had spent, according to Facebook data.Mr. Biden told donors at a sushi restaurant in Los Angeles last week that he had nearly 670,000 donations overall with an average donation of $46, which would translate to only about $10.8 million this quarter. A Biden campaign official said the former vice president had not presented the ""full picture"" but declined to elaborate.A Biden campaign official said Tuesday that the former vice president had ""unequivocally"" raised enough money to be competitive in the primary race, and that details would be released soon.[ Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.]Steve Westly, a bundler for Mr. Biden in California, said that skeptics and critics place too much importance on any one measurement of Mr. Biden's candidacy.""Every time someone is a front-runner, they say, 'Oh my gosh, they're not ahead in every straw poll, ahead in every state and every fund-raising report,""' Mr. Westly said. ""The reality is you want to be in first place, which is where Joe Biden is.""Harold Schaitberger, a close Biden ally and president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, which has endorsed Mr. Biden, compared the race to a schoolyard game of ""king of the hill.""""If you're the king and you're on the hill, everybody else -- in this case certainly within the Democratic candidates and the Republican Party -- are doing everything they can to take you off the hill,"" he said. ""That's the point of it.""He said he had ""seen no indication of any concern"" about resources.For Mr. Sanders, his $25.3 million quarter -- which included his second biggest day for fund-raising of the campaign, on Monday -- was a welcome reprieve from weeks of questions about his pathway as he has stagnated in the polls and has been passed on the left by Ms. Warren. (In one Iowa poll, more of those who caucused with Mr. Sanders in 2016 said they planned to support Ms. Warren in 2020 than him.)""Media elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign,"" said Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, ""and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution.""For Mr. Buttigieg, the third quarter was a period of rapid expansion: He went from zero field offices in the early states to 42, and his staff jumped to 400 people. Mr. Buttigieg, who began the year as a little-known mayor, has raised more than $51 million for the year, a remarkable sum for a newcomer to the national scene. But he has struggled to translate that cash into support beyond single digits in the polls.While Ms. Harris's haul was similar to her previous quarters, she entered October on a far different trajectory. She began the quarter riding high from her June debate performance -- raising $4 million in the last four days of that month -- but had faded by late September, promising to refocus on Iowa amid a staff shake-up.One other campaign announced its numbers Tuesday: Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey raised more than $6 million, his best quarter yet. Ten days ago, in a gambit to draw attention and donations, Mr. Booker's campaign said he would quit the race if he did not collect at least $1.7 million; he raised more than $2.1 million.The quarterly fund-raising report will be the first for Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas representative, since the shooting in his hometown of El Paso that appeared to give his candidacy fresh purpose.Andrew Yang, the New York executive running a web-savvy campaign centered on the idea of giving away $1,000 to every American every month, is expected to post by far his best haul of the campaign.PhotographSupporters of Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind., during his bus tour through Iowa last month.

| Jump to first hitKostiantyn H. Kulyk has been indicted himself on corruption charges and has a reputation for using investigations as political weapons.KIEV, Ukraine -- When the Ukrainian prosecutor Kostiantyn H. Kulyk compiled a seven-page dossier in English that accused the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. of corruption, he helped set off a political firestorm that has led to the impeachment investigation of President Trump.But even as he was reopening a corruption case related to Hunter Biden's service on the board of Burisma Holdings, a major Ukrainian gas company, Mr. Kulyk himself was under a cloud of suspicion.He has been indicted three times on corruption charges and accused of bringing politically motivated criminal cases against his opponents. In a Ukrainian security clearance form, Mr. Kulyk admitted having ties to a warlord in eastern Ukraine accused of working for the Russian intelligence services.Yet none of this -- including the case related to the Bidens -- has seemed to harm the career of Mr. Kulyk, who remains a department head in the Ukrainian prosecutor general's office under a new president, Volodymyr Zelensky.""In Ukraine, a toxic person can keep a job,"" said Yuriy Butusov, editor in chief of the political news outlet Tsenzor.net. ""That's not a problem.""Mr. Kulyk's continued presence in the halls of government illustrates the blending of politics and criminal justice in Ukraine, where investigations are routinely used as political weapons or to grease the business interests of wealthy insiders. And the spread of his dossier in Washington shows how these tactics have spilled into American politics.In a July phone call that is central to the impeachment inquiry, President Trump asked Mr. Zelensky to investigate the Biden case, including supposed conflicts of interest by Mr. Biden when he was vice president, and a debunked theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Zelensky agreed, according to White House notes on the call, saying a new prosecutor general ""will look into the situation,"" though he said later that the new prosecutor would act fairly and independently.In a statement, the prosecutor general's office declined to clarify if Mr. Kulyk retains control over the Biden case, which is now under an audit that delays any prosecutorial decisions. Mr. Kulyk did not respond to requests for an interview.Mr. Kulyk's dossier did more than revive the Biden case. The seven-page document he compiled and circulated also accused American diplomats of covering up for crimes committed by the Bidens, a spurious theory that played a role in the recall of the American ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch.A strapping former military prosecutor with a buzz cut, Mr. Kulyk pivoted his allegiance to Mr. Zelensky late in the Ukrainian presidential race last spring, allowing him to continue holding sway over important matters.Currently, he is pursuing a case against a former central bank governor that could aid a powerful oligarch, Ihor Kolomoisky, a former business partner of Mr. Zelensky. The case has become entangled in talks with the International Monetary Fund about a $5 billion aid program for Ukraine. Those broke off last month amid concerns about Mr. Kolomoisky's influence on the government. Calls seeking comment from Mr. Kolomoisky on a phone number he has used in the past went unanswered.The Kolomoisky case and Mr. Kulyk's role in it have become a credibility test for Mr. Zelensky, who swept to office on an anticorruption platform.""If he doesn't fire Kulyk it will be a big negative for him, because then no one will believe that he is a reformer,"" said Valeria A. Gontareva, the former central banker involved in the case. ""If this country doesn't get real rule of law then all of our reforms will be easily reversed.""In March, Mr. Kulyk, who with a former prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, had coordinated with Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to promote the allegations against the Bidens, suddenly switched allegiance in Ukraine's domestic politics.He and Mr. Lutsenko had been seen as staunch enforcers for President Petro O. Poroshenko. But two days before the first round of the country's presidential election -- with opinion polls showing Mr. Zelensky crushing Mr. Poroshenko -- Mr. Kulyk filed criminal corruption charges against dozens of Poroshenko aides. He then went on a television talk show to discuss the highlights of these cases.An on-air confrontation ensued. Mr. Poroshenko rushed to the studio and accused Mr. Kulyk of naked political abuse of the justice system. The 11th-hour smear nevertheless reinforced Mr. Zelensky's campaign message that the country needed a new leader to root out corruption.Corruption allegations trailed Mr. Kulyk long before his role in the Biden case. In 2016, he was indicted on charges of illegal enrichment, with prosecutors noting that his expensive tastes seemed incongruous with his modest salary as a prosecutor. Court documents describe Mr. Kulyk as owning assets equivalent to 1,615 times the minimum cost of living for Ukraine, including two apartments in central Kiev and a Toyota Land Cruiser that together cost more than four years' worth of his income.""In any other country a prosecutor like this would have been fired a long time ago,"" said Andrii Savin, a lawyer with Ukraine's Anticorruption Action Center who has followed Mr. Kulyk's career closely. ""But what happened in this country? The prosecutor general promoted him.""Mr. Kulyk has also come under fire for his ties to a man believed to be a Russian intelligence agent in his hometown, Kharkiv, in eastern Ukraine.Mr. Kulyk disclosed the friendship in an application for security clearance in 2014 as war broke out between Russia-backed separatists and Ukraine, Mr. Kulyk's former boss in the military prosecutor's office, Anatoly Matios, told Ukrainian media in 2017.Mr. Kulyk had known the man, Yevhen Zhylin, when Mr. Kulyk served in the Kharkiv regional prosecutor's office and Mr. Zhylin ran a martial arts club in the city, called Oplot, or the Stronghold. Oplot was subsequently transformed into a large, Russian-backed paramilitary unit fighting on the separatist side.Mr. Matios told the Ukrainian media that Mr. Kulyk had passed the security clearance, but added: ""I will tell you something: The moral principles of this person are worthless.""Investigators who pursued the illegal enrichment case against Mr. Kulyk did, however, find the source of one unexplained asset: the Toyota Land Cruiser. It was registered to the father of Mr. Zhylin, the commander on the pro-Russian side in the war.In the middle of his corruption trial, Mr. Kulyk was transferred from the military prosecutor's service to Kiev, where he became a department head in the prosecutor general office's international department. (Ms. Yovanovitch, then the new American ambassador, was among those who objected to the move.)It was in this position that Mr. Kulyk began digging into Burisma, the gas company where Hunter Biden served on the board.In an interview published in The Hill in April, Mr. Kulyk told the conservative commentator John Solomon that he had been trying to give the United States government what he said was evidence of sweeping wrongdoing by Democrats and American diplomats, but had been blocked by officials in the American Embassy in Kiev.The substance of the interview was consistent with the theory laid out in the dossier he compiled in late 2018, according to his former colleagues at the prosecutor's office. The dossier, which was leaked by a Ukrainian blogger, asserted that Ukrainian prosecutors had evidence that ""may attest to the commission of corrupt actions aimed at personal unlawful enrichment by the former Vice President of the United States Joe Biden.""Mr. Lutsenko, the former prosecutor general, said in an interview that he never gave Mr. Kulyk's dossier to Mr. Giuliani. But notes taken by Mr. Giuliani during their meeting in January, passed to Congress this month by the State Department inspector general, mirror the ideas laid out in Mr. Kulyk's memo.And in her testimony in the impeachment inquiry on Friday, Ms. Yovanovitch, the former ambassador, suggested that Mr. Kulyk's dossier, or its main points, had filtered even higher in the American government. She said her recall from Kiev last spring was tied to ""unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.""Maria Varenikova contributed reporting.PhotographKostiantyn H. Kulyk has been indicted three times for corruption but remains a department head.

| Jump to first hit'Trump anxiety disorder' has morphed into anxiety about everything, and impeachment isn't helping.GREENWOOD, S.C. -- The past three years have not been easy for the political fortunes or the emotional health of America's Democrats. To the extent they feel optimistic about anything, they have been waiting for the 2020 election in the way inhabitants of a storm-ravaged city might look toward the end of hurricane season -- as an opportunity to restore order not just to their fractured physical world, but to their battered psyches.Why, then, even with the potential catharsis of impeachment proceedings against President Trump underway, do so many feel so awful?""My big fear is that we are not coalescing around one candidate, and I don't know in the end if there's enough people who will come out and vote,"" said Mac Macnair, a Democrat who lives in a deep-red county in rural Georgia. ""Four years is as long as I can go, but eight years -- we won't even have an America left.""Ms. Macnair, a former teacher in her late 50s, was in Greenwood a few weeks ago to listen to her preferred candidate, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., speak in a college gym. She was excited to hear what he had to say. But she was still fretting about the state of the party, and the state of the nation, at the end of 2019.On the one hand, of course, there is Mr. Trump, who set up camp in the deep corners of the American psyche three years ago and has remained there ever since, a larger-than-life-presence for supporters and detractors alike, the invisible guest whose existence can ruin a holiday meal as quickly as your cousin can utter the word ""Ukraine.""On the other hand there is the vast field of bickering Democratic candidates, so many candidates that it can be hard to keep them straight, so many candidates that they seem at risk of canceling each other out and failing at the one job they are theoretically meant to do: win the election. Meanwhile, impeachment itself serves as nothing more than a Rorschach test of worry set to Robert's Rules of Order.""If they're not going to get along, they need to keep quiet,"" said Beverly Hall, 63, another Biden supporter at the Greenwood event. But beyond being happy about her candidate, she has watched and read a lot about the election, she said, and she does not feel great.""This guy who's on the commercials -- Jim, what's his name?"" she said, referring to Tom Steyer. ""I like what he's saying. I like the issues he's bringing up. But why are you spending $3 million on TV when you could be giving the money to Joe?""Some people are suffering from general political angst. Others have specific qualms: a concern that their favorite candidate lacks that essential quality, electability; a worry that fellow Democrats will become disillusioned if their chosen candidate fails to get the nomination and will vote for a third-party candidate, or for Mr. Trump, or for no one at all -- the ""Bernie or Nobody"" scenario.A sampling of interviews with Democrats in different parts of the country reveals that worry comes in many forms.From Jobetta Hedelman-Beaver, 39, of Kennewick, Wash.: ""I'm anxious about Trump. I'm super-anxious about him. I blame him for my high blood pressure.""From Katie Matlin, 40, in Northbrook, Ill.: ""My husband has major anxiety around the election. We actually cannot watch news coverage in our house because any news about Donald Trump triggers his anxiety.""From the actor Robert De Niro, appearing on ""The Late Show With Stephen Colbert"": ""It's like living in an abusive household. You don't know what's going to happen next, what crazy thing is going to happen next, what's going to make you say, 'What the hell is going on?""'From David Kaye, 37, in Milwaukee: ""During previous elections, I'd have a giant spreadsheet and follow every candidate. But it's not fun anymore. It's still just as important, but it triggers my anxiety, and sometimes it triggers panic attacks. I'm not following out of interest or a sense of fun, but out of a sense of not wanting our civilization to fall.""How is this anxiety manifesting itself for Democratic voters as they look toward 2020?Let us count the ways.Fear of Candidate OverloadThere are 15 Democrats vying for the party's nomination. That is a lot, even considering that 13 others, most recently Kamala Harris, have dropped out of the race. The late-in-the-game entry of two additional possibilities -- Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Deval Patrick of Massachusetts -- smacks to some of Hail Mary desperation at a point when the party should have gotten its act together by now.""There are too many candidates, and too long a process,"" said Susan Ramos, 55, a resident of Greenwood. ""They need to put their resources behind one candidate and consolidate their power. ""Toya Davis, 56, who also lives in Greenwood and is a onetime Republican who became a Democrat when Barack Obama was running for president, said that excessive numbers of Democratic candidates were cluttering the field and diluting the project.""I wish half of them would just drop out,"" she said.Fear That the Democrats Won't Rally Around AnyoneMs. Macnair said that she felt particularly concerned by what she hears from younger Democrats. She mentioned a 30-year-old acquaintance who lives in Iowa and is a passionate supporter of Bernie Sanders.""He said that young people wouldn't vote for a Democratic candidate unless it's Bernie,"" she said, ""and that he can't figure out why any young person would vote for Biden.""That sort of talk makes Ms. Davis hyperventilate as she recalls previous presidential elections and the spoiling presence of candidates like Ralph Nader and Jill Stein. She mentioned Ross Perot, and how he muddied the waters as an independent and then a third-party candidate in the 1990s.""It makes me very, very nervous,"" she said.Fear That Good News for the President is Bad News for the DemocratsThe stock market is roaring. Unemployment is at a record low. The economy added 266,000 new jobs in November. Though these things are objectively good, of course, they are less good if you are a Democrat and you don't want the current president to get credit for anything that might help him get re-elected.Take Mr. Trump's announcement in October that U.S. Special Forces had killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the Islamic State movement. That could be considered positive news for the president, some Democratic voters conceded in interviews, except that Mr. Trump presented the news in such an unpleasant way, they said, embellishing his narrative with unsubstantiated details about Mr. al-Baghdadi's last moments.""Trump had to make a 50-minute speech about how wonderful he is,"" said Jane Worm, 77, of Dubuque County, Iowa.In Durham, N.H., Barbara Feldman, 68, said she was worried that Mr. Trump would capitalize on the incident to bolster his popularity.""I do worry about his base, and his support, unless the young people get out and vote,"" she said.Fear of ... PoliticsFor the last three years, therapists have reported an increase in patients who say that almost anything having to do with politics is making them uneasy, angry and hopeless, a condition that Jennifer C. Panning, a psychologist in Evanston, Ill., has christened ""Trump anxiety disorder.""In a survey of 3,617 American adults released in November, the American Psychological Association found that 56 percent said that the 2020 election was a ""significant stressor"" -- as opposed to 52 percent before the 2016 election.""It depends on what side of the aisle you're on, but for many people there's the question, 'What is going on with this country that someone can get away with so much?""' said Dr. Mary Alvord, a therapist in Maryland who teaches psychiatry and behavioral medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine.In Athens, Ga., Dr. J. Kip Matthews, a therapist who sees both conservative and liberal patients, said that the mean-spiritedness, tribalism and uncertainty of the political discussion was causing anxiety on all sides. ""It forces you to think, 'Do I hang on to my values and beliefs, or do I change them?""' he said. ""Change is very stressful for people, and more often than not you just double down on what your original beliefs were.""Dr. Barry A. Farber, a therapist and professor of psychology and education at Columbia University's Teachers College, last year compiled a series of papers called ""Clowns to the Left of Me, Jokers to the Right: Politics and Psychotherapy."" (The title was inspired by a 40-ish male patient who told Dr. Farber that he was disgusted both by the Republicans, for their mean behavior and ""callousness,"" and by the Democrats, for their ""endless political correctness"" and ""absurd naïveté."") In the papers, fellow therapists described how politics has become a dominant theme in their sessions with patients, stirring up old traumas and new terrors.""There's something about the ongoing saga of President Trump that hasn't gone away,"" Dr. Farber said. ""This isn't an event so much as an ongoing occurrence, something that feels life-changing, something that has changed the country in ways that has implications for the way that people live.""Supporters of the president, Dr. Farber wrote in an introduction to the compilation, are suffused by a ""Why can't all those liberals just accept that fact that he won?"" resentment toward Mr. Trump's critics. As for liberal Democrats, who make up the majority of his own and his colleagues' patients, they have gone through a fairly consistent trajectory: shock at Mr. Trump's election; a period of waiting to see what would happen; and then the realization that, as he said, ""this wasn't going away.""Anxiety as MotivatorDr. Alvord, whose parents fled Russia as children in the 1930s and who grew up in Queens, not far from Donald Trump, said that she, too, had been unsettled by the events of the last three years.But she said that the ""black cloud"" of depression that descended on so many of her patients after the election has given way to something else.""I hear people saying, 'I don't want to hear the president speak because it unnerves me so much,""' she said. ""But the good thing about anxiety is that it can have an activating and motivating part to it. I lead people to a discussion of, what can you do.""One thing it has done for Ms. Macnair, the Georgia resident: it has made her more sensitive to the concerns of her neighbors, rural Republicans who fly Trump banners alongside the American flags outside their houses. She would like her fellow Democrats to nominate a moderate candidate, she said, so that Republicans won't feel as alienated from or terrified of that person as Democrats feel about Mr. Trump.""Frankly, it breaks my heart and crushes my soul that people are so divided in this country,"" she said. ""I try so hard to find common ground on issues we can find common ground on.""Sydney Ember contributed reporting.PhotographThe field of Democratic presidential candidates is so large that some fear they will risk canceling each other out and fail to defeat Mr. Trump. ""They need to put their resources behind one candidate and consolidate their power,"" one voter said.

| Jump to first hitMoody's data shows that higher taxes would be paid disproportionately in Democratic-leaning states.Much of the Democratic primary race has focused on taxes aimed at the billionaire class -- policies devised to reduce inequality and fund progressive goals on health care and education.But there's also a less discussed tax increase in leading Democratic policy proposals that would affect not just a tiny sliver of the ultra-wealthy, but also millions of high-income workers. For these people, many of them affluent professionals in Democratic strongholds, it would be the biggest tax increase in recent memory.This year, American workers and their employers owe a combined 12.4 percent on Social Security payroll taxes for income up to $132,900 (rising to $137,700 in 2020). They owe nothing on earnings above that level.Some Democrats in the thick of the presidential race and on Capitol Hill now seek to change or eliminate that cap -- potentially placing a new double-digit tax on high earners, with several plans focusing on earnings above $250,000.This would pump vastly more money into Social Security, enabling more generous benefits and helping sustain the finances of a program that could be forced to slash benefits in the decades ahead if nothing is done.The result would be a large tax increase on high earners, even before other changes a Democratic administration might contemplate, such as increasing income tax rates or taxes on investment income.In the Obama administration, for example, the top income tax rate was increased by 4.6 percentage points, and a Medicare tax of 0.9 percentage points was placed on high earners to help pay for expanded health coverage. Depending on the details, applying Social Security taxes to high incomes would increase the combined tax owed on each additional dollar of income for top earners by two to three times as much.And it would eliminate a feature of the Social Security system that has made it politically untouchable through the decades -- that the taxes Americans pay in are closely related to the benefits they eventually receive, assuming they live long enough. The top earners facing new Social Security taxes would not see their future benefits rise commensurately; rather it would amount to a transfer from high earners to low- and middle-income Social Security recipients.""The traditional argument has always been that Social Security is very popular because it's not seen like a traditional welfare program,"" said Kyle Pomerleau, a resident fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. ""What you pay in roughly corresponds to what you get. Once you start taxing certain levels of income without providing additional benefits based on that tax, you are breaking that link.""As such, the new Democratic approach to Social Security amounts to a test of what affluent liberals are willing to sacrifice to accomplish progressive goals. For a sign of how ostensibly progressive Democrats can recoil at tax changes that affect their pocketbooks, nearly all Democratic senators recently voted to eliminate a cap on the deductibility of state and local taxes. The deductions favor high-income people in high-tax states, and the cap was part of the Republicans' 2017 tax overhaul.Elizabeth Warren, who has the most detailed plan, would tax earnings above $250,000 at a 14.8 percent rate, including both the employees' and employers' share. This would finance an extra $200 a month in retirement or disability benefits for beneficiaries of Social Security -- a 15 percent increase for the average recipient, devised to help lift many retirees out of poverty. It would also expand Social Security benefits for people like widowed spouses and those who worked as caregivers outside the formal work force.Bernie Sanders would also apply the current 12.4 percent combined Social Security tax rate to all income above $250,000. Joe Biden has pledged to increase benefits and solidify Social Security's finances without detailing exactly what changes to payroll taxes he would use to do so.A bill supported by a broad coalition of House Democrats would apply the current tax of 12.4 percent to all earnings above $400,000, and gradually raise the combined rate to 14.8 percent.Ms. Warren's proposal hasn't received as much attention and debate as her proposed wealth tax on families with assets of more than $50 million. But her Social Security plan would affect around seven million Americans, compared with the 75,000 that her advisers estimate would be affected by the wealth tax.""She will extend the program's solvency by nearly two decades by asking just the top 2 percent to contribute more,"" said Saloni Sharma, a Warren campaign spokeswoman. ""She will provide a $200 immediate increase in benefits across the board for every current and future beneficiary -- the biggest increase in benefits in nearly 50 years.""Under Ms. Warren's Social Security plan, and not incorporating any other changes to the tax code, a family with one wage earner making $300,000 a year, for example, would pay an extra $7,400 in tax each year. For each additional dollar earned over that level, total federal tax obligations would rise to 39 cents, up from 27 cents today. (Those numbers include both taxes deducted from workers' paychecks and those paid by employers, which economists believe are ultimately borne by workers.)""This is a much bigger deal for more households than the wealth tax,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, which analyzed Ms. Warren's proposal at her campaign's request. ""The wealth tax is a mind shift, opening up a new source of revenue. In terms of the number of people impacted, this is much bigger.""For those making millions of dollars and living in a high-tax location like New York City, the combined marginal tax rate -- including federal income tax, Medicare and Social Security tax, and state and local income tax -- would be about 63 percent. Sweden currently has the highest top overall marginal tax rate among rich nations, at 60.1 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.Moreover, the Warren and Sanders plans would apply Social Security taxes to investment income for the first time, not just to earnings. That would make it harder for high-income people to avoid taxes by reclassifying their labor income as business income. This has the potential to reduce the accumulation of savings, and over time reduce investment in the economy.Higher Social Security benefits are popular in public opinion polls. The tax increases proposed by Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders would apply to a slim minority of earners: 4.6 percent, according to Moody's Analytics.Moody's data also shows that the higher taxes would be paid disproportionately in Democratic-leaning states. The 12 states with the highest share of earners who would owe higher taxes all voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, led by New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts.""People who live in affluent areas and are making good money, are they going to jump with glee over paying more taxes?"" said Representative John Larson, a Connecticut Democrat who is author of the congressional Democrats' plan to expand Social Security benefits. ""I can't argue in good faith that people are sending me love notes from wealthy suburban counties.""But, he argued, people who have enjoyed high incomes will be willing to pay higher taxes to ensure that the Social Security system remains financially viable and that beneficiaries receive an adequate income.""Are we prepared to look people in the eye and tell them that with the enormous wealth disparity we have that people who have worked all their lives shouldn't be able to sustain themselves with dignity?"" Mr. Larson said.In effect, these proposals would raise taxes substantially on the people who have been the big winners in the 21st-century economy -- high-income professionals who are disproportionately located in affluent coastal areas -- and redistribute it to middle-income people nationwide.Over recent decades, the share of total earnings that escapes Social Security tax has risen -- a reflection of rapidly rising earnings at the top of the income scale. In 1983, 90 percent of earnings were subject to Social Security taxes; the rate fell to 83 percent in 2016, according to the Congressional Budget Office.In some ways, the new Democratic proposals are intended to reverse that trend, by disproportionately taxing more of their own voters' paychecks.""The goal is to provide economic security, so the first question is what level do we want and what is the fairest way to distribute the cost,"" said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, which advocates expanding benefits. ""Given income and wealth inequality in the last few decades, I think all of these proposals make sense.""The question is how to spread the cost while not undermining the basic structure of the program.""In particular, she noted, even people with incomes well above current cutoffs would see expanded Social Security benefits (though not in proportion to their higher earnings), and the rate they pay would be the same as for low- and middle-income people.As the proposals get more focus and as the election debates wear on, a big question for 2020 is how much Democratic loyalists -- who would be paying a lot of that bill -- will remain behind it.PhotographA commuter at Grand Central Terminal.

| Jump to first hitThe Republican speaker of the Texas House was recorded saying President Trump is ""killing us"" in suburban districts. On Thursday, the president came to Dallas for a rally.AUSTIN, Texas -- With President Trump arriving in red-state Texas for a campaign rally in Dallas on Thursday, the Republican Party in the state faces a host of troubles.The Republican-controlled Texas House of Representatives is engulfed in scandal. Six of the state's 23 Republican members of the United States House of Representatives say they will not run for re-election, opening new opportunities for Democrats. And one of the state's three top Republican leaders believes that the president has become a political liability among a crucial bloc of voters.""With all due respect to Trump -- who I love, by the way -- he's killing us in urban-suburban districts,"" Dennis Bonnen, the speaker of the state House and the central figure in the legislative scandal, said in a 64-minute tape recording released on Tuesday.The recording of a sometimes salty conversation Mr. Bonnen had with a conservative activist at the State Capitol in June includes a description of what critics have called a quid-pro-quo offer that is now under investigation by the Texas Rangers.Mr. Bonnen says the tape, which was recorded without his knowledge, proves that nothing he said in the conversation broke any laws.Even so, the political landscape in Texas will now feature both an embattled state leader struggling to hold on to the speakership and an embattled president confronting an impeachment inquiry -- a prospect that unquestionably raises the stakes for Republicans in a state their party has dominated for more than two decades.Consequently, ""corruption and abuse of power become not just a national issue but potentially a state-level issue for Republicans as well,"" said Jim Henson, a pollster and political analyst based in Austin.The impeachment inquiry's impact on Texas voters is unclear.As Republican leaders in Texas spread out the welcome mat for the president's first re-election campaign appearance in Dallas, the state party chairman, James Dickey, offered an upbeat assessment. Mr. Dickey said that Mr. Trump was doing an ""amazing job"" despite ""an endless onslaught of attacks"" and that fund-raising and volunteer recruitment for the 2020 race were going well.But some recent polls suggest that Mr. Trump is not assured of a second victory in Texas, which he carried in 2016 by 9 percentage points, the smallest margin for a Republican presidential candidate in the state since 1996. (Texas has not voted for a Democrat since Jimmy Carter in 1976.)Analysts generally share the speaker's assessment that Mr. Trump has hurt Republican chances in the state's suburbs, particularly among women, many of whom are offended by his blustery and unpredictable temperament.""There is no question whatsoever that Mr. Trump is more of a liability to the Republican Party than an asset,"" said Mark Jones, professor of political science at the Baker Institute at Rice University. ""Over all, you can say he represents a drag on the Republican ticket.""A survey released in June by the University of Texas and The Texas Tribune found Texas voters split down the middle on the president, with half saying they would vote to re-elect him and half saying they would vote against him. Mr. Henson, who heads the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas and is one of the poll's directors, said the result ""encapsulates how divisive Trump is.""In August, a poll conducted by The Dallas Morning News and Emerson College found that Texas voters narrowly preferred former Vice President Joe Biden, a front-runner in the Democratic primary race, over Mr. Trump, 51 percent to 49 percent.Even so, Mr. Trump still commands a loyal following, with an 80 percent approval rating among Republicans.Trump supporters lined up days in advance for tickets to the rally at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, and organizers estimated that as many as 40,000 to 50,000 people would attend. The Democratic presidential contender Beto O'Rourke, a former member of Congress from El Paso with a statewide following, planned to hold a competing rally in Grand Prairie, a Dallas suburb.In Texas and in other states across the country, Republicans have been losing ground in suburbs that were once strongholds for the G.O.P. Among other trends, urban dwellers have been moving to the suburbs in search of more affordable housing and an easier pace, bringing their generally more progressive views with them. Mr. Trump's combative, hard-line style does not tend to go down well with those voters.Mr. Trump ""serves as a factor that mobilizes Democrats,"" Mr. Henson said. ""In these suburban areas, where we saw Democrats take seats from Republicans in the 2018 election, Trump is a problem.""Democrats made substantial gains in Texas in 2018, flipping two House seats, two Texas Senate seats and 12 Texas House seats, some of them in Republican bastions like Fort Worth. Mr. O'Rourke's energetic campaign for the United States Senate came unexpectedly close to defeating a Republican incumbent, Ted Cruz, and lent momentum to down-ballot races.Leaders in both parties say that the 2020 election, centered on the presidential race, will also be critical in determining the balance of power in Texas. The House seats left open by the six retiring Republicans will be a top priority for both parties.In the 150-member Texas House, Democrats are nine seats away from winning a majority for the first time since 2003, and many in the party see opportunity in the disarray among Republicans over the scandal surrounding Mr. Bonnen. Mr. Dickey, the Republican state chairman, said his party planned ""to do everything we must to ensure victory in 2020,"" and was hoping for ""a swift resolution"" to the turmoil in the House.""Our consistent position is that anything that distracts from victory in 2020 is counterproductive,"" Mr. Dickey said of the scandal. Several Republican members of the chamber have called for Mr. Bonnen's resignation as speaker.The recording released on Tuesday was made secretly by Michael Quinn Sullivan of Empower Texans, a conservative activist group, during a June 12 conversation he had with Mr. Bonnen and Dustin Burrows, who was then the Republican leader in the House. Mr. Bonnen is heard saying that he would grant Mr. Sullivan's longstanding request to provide House media credentials to representatives from his organization, in exchange for Mr. Sullivan helping to defeat 10 moderate Republican House incumbents in primaries.""Let's go after these Republicans -- and I'm not kidding,"" Mr. Bonnen says.Mr. Sullivan, a firebrand known for battling the Republican establishment, ignited the scandal when he revealed Mr. Bonnen's offer in an online post on July 25, later disclosing that he had recorded the conversation. His release of the tape, which seemed to support his initial account, was yet another bombshell.Mr. Sullivan is heard saying that he does not want anything in return for opposing the 10 moderates. Mr. Bonnen responds: ""Well, no, you do. You do. We can make this work. I'll put your guys on the floor next session.""The speaker is heard using crude language at times to denigrate other lawmakers. One, Representative Michelle Beckley of Carrollton, a Democrat whom Mr. Bonnen described as ""vile,"" responded to the release of the tape by sending out a fund-raising missive saying, ""Republicans fear me more than any other Democrat.""Representative Chris Turner of Grand Prairie, the leader of House Democrats, said the revelations in the tape were ""incompatible with Mr. Bonnen serving another term as speaker.""But Mr. Bonnen said in a statement that the tape provided ""clear evidence now disproving allegations of criminal wrongdoing,"" and said ""the House can finally move on.""The next major turn in the case will come when the Texas Rangers, the criminal investigative arm of the state Department of Public Safety, announces the results of its investigation. The department's media office said this week that the investigation was ""still active and ongoing,"" and did not give a projected completion date.PhotographAs Texans prepared for a Trump rally in Dallas, Dennis Bonnen, the state House speaker, was facing scrutiny after being recorded saying that the president had become a political liability.

| Jump to first hitThe day after the first public impeachment hearing, Speaker Nancy Pelosi used the word ""bribery,"" mentioned in the Constitution's impeachment clause, to describe President Trump's conduct.WASHINGTON -- Speaker Nancy Pelosi sharpened the focus of Democrats' impeachment case against President Trump on Thursday, accusing the president of committing bribery when he withheld vital military assistance from Ukraine at the same time he was seeking its commitment to publicly investigate his political rivals.The speaker's explicit allegation of bribery, a misdeed identified in the Constitution as an impeachable offense, was significant. Even as Ms. Pelosi said that no final decision had been made on whether to impeach Mr. Trump, it suggested that Democrats were moving toward a more specific set of charges that could be codified in articles of impeachment in the coming weeks. It also indicated that Democrats were working to put a simple name to the president's alleged wrongdoing that would resonate with the public.""The devastating testimony corroborated evidence of bribery uncovered in the inquiry, and that the president abused his power and violated his oath by threatening to withhold military aid and a White House meeting in exchange for an investigation into his political rival -- a clear attempt by the president to give himself an advantage in the 2020 election,"" Ms. Pelosi told reporters at her weekly news conference in the Capitol.The remarks came as impeachment investigators closed in on two potentially significant breakthroughs that could help build their case.A second witness emerged to corroborate a key episode revealed during public impeachment testimony on Wednesday that further tied Mr. Trump to the pressure campaign on Ukraine. The account of a telephone call in which the president discussed his interest in having Ukraine begin investigations will help bolster Democrats' case against Mr. Trump, but it could also undercut the credibility of their best witness who can describe direct conversations with the president.Later Thursday, a high-ranking career official appeared poised to become the first witness to cooperate with the inquiry from the White House Office of Management and Budget, which played a key role in holding up the delivery of $391 million in security assistance at the center of the inquiry. A lawyer for the official, Mark Sandy, said that he would appear for a deposition on Saturday if subpoenaed, despite orders from the White House not to.Mr. Trump worked to defend himself and shore up his support among Republicans who could decide the fate of his presidency. Over lunch at the White House, he showed a group of Republican senators a reconstructed transcript of a congratulatory phone conversation he had in April with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Mr. Trump has promised repeatedly to release the document, in part to counter the notion that he ever pressured Mr. Zelensky, but by Thursday evening it had not been made public.""He just shuffled it across the table,"" Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, who attended the lunch, told reporters afterward, calling the conversation ""a very nice, congratulatory call.""""It said 'Congratulations, you ran a great campaign.' 'Oh, thank you, Mr. President, look forward to working with you,""' Mr. Cramer said.The president's thinking seemed to be that the congratulatory April call might draw attention away from his July exchange with Mr. Zelensky in which he pressed the Ukrainian president to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and a discredited theory about Democrats conspiring with Ukraine to interfere in the 2016 election. Democrats consider a reconstructed transcript of that call their most damning evidence against Mr. Trump.The House Intelligence Committee plans to convene another impeachment hearing on Friday, calling Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former American ambassador to Ukraine whose ouster by Mr. Trump, some members say, set the stage for his pressure campaign.The Intelligence Committee convened the House's first public impeachment hearing in two decades on Wednesday with testimony from William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, and George P. Kent, a senior State Department official responsible for policy toward the country.They told the committee that Mr. Trump and his allies inside and outside the government placed the president's political objectives at the center of American policy toward Ukraine, using as leverage both the security assistance that Congress had appropriated for Ukraine's war with Russia as well as a White House meeting that was coveted by the country's new leader.The new witness who emerged on Thursday, Suriya Jayanti, a State Department official in Kiev, would be able to describe a phone call she overheard between the president and Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, in which they discussed the investigations Mr. Trump sought. Ms. Jayanti sat at a restaurant with Mr. Sondland and at least one other embassy official, David Holmes, as Mr. Sondland and Mr. Trump spoke by phone in July, according to two people briefed on the matter.During that call, Mr. Trump brought up the investigations he sought and Mr. Sondland said the Ukrainians were prepared to move forward with them. After the call, Mr. Sondland told at least Mr. Holmes that Mr. Trump cared more about the investigations his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani had been pushing the Ukranians to commit to than about Ukraine.The conversation took place just a day after the July 25 phone call in which Mr. Trump raised the investigations with Mr. Zelensky.Mr. Taylor first disclosed the existence of the call during his testimony on Wednesday. Investigators plan to interview Mr. Holmes privately on Friday to press for additional details. They may also ask Ms. Jayanti to testify.Though her account bolsters Democrats' accusations, it raises new questions about the credibility of Mr. Sondland, who is scheduled to testify publicly next week. Because the White House has blocked other officials from cooperating, Mr. Sondland is one of the few witnesses who spoke directly with Mr. Trump and is therefore important to Democrats' case. But he already substantially revised his testimony once, admitting that he told a top Ukrainian official in September that the country would probably not receive military aid unless it announced the investigations that Mr. Trump wanted.Now it has become clear that he also failed to disclose to the committee the July call he had with Mr. Trump.Republicans pounced on the inconsistencies to try to discredit Mr. Sondland, a wealthy hotelier and Trump campaign donor who had no diplomatic experience before the president installed him as an ambassador.""I think that if Ambassador Sondland's credibility is questioned, it makes it really hard for the Democrats to impeach, because everything is based on Ambassador Sondland,"" said Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina.During a rally on Thursday night in Louisiana, Mr. Trump appeared to be trying to do just that. He read aloud from a news article that included new remarks by Ukraine's foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, who said Mr. Sondland had never told him or other officials he knew of a connection between the military aid and the investigations.""Can you believe? Like we need help to beat sleepy Joe Biden,"" Mr. Trump said. The Interfax-Ukraine news agency first reported Mr. Prystaiko's remarks.Mr. Sondland, though, never claimed to have discussed the matter with the foreign minister. He said he had told another Ukrainian official who is close to Mr. Zelensky, Andriy Yermak, of the link.Democrats have not exactly been forgiving, either, but they argue that Republicans are overstating the implications for the case they are building, particularly if Mr. Sondland confirms the new details.""Obviously it doesn't help his credibility,"" said Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, Democrat of New York. ""But no one can dispute he is a person with important information who was at the center of these events, a firsthand witness to the president's actions. All we want from Ambassador Sondland is the whole truth, and nothing but.""Rank-and-file Democrats have begun using the term ""bribery"" more freely in recent days to describe what a string of diplomats and career Trump administration officials have said was a highly unusual and inappropriate effort by Mr. Trump and a small group around him to extract a public promise from Ukraine for investigations.But Ms. Pelosi's remarks on impeachment were the first time she discussed the growing inquiry at length with reporters since Congress recessed in late October.""The bribe is to grant or withhold military assistance in return for a public statement of a fake investigation into the elections,"" Ms. Pelosi said, clarifying her choice of words. ""That's bribery.""Ms. Pelosi was referring to Article II of the Constitution, which states that the president and other public officers ""shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors."" The founders, who were preoccupied with the young republic's independence from foreign influence, included the term to ensure the president was acting in the interest of the United States.""The framers had this concept of an illicit exchange, the president using his power in exchange for something that was beneficial for him, and perhaps vice versa,"" said Michael J. Gerhardt, a constitutional law professor and an impeachment scholar at the University of North Carolina.For Democrats, the term may also help solve a communications challenge. After weeks of describing the president's actions as a ""quid pro quo,"" lawmakers are looking for a more straightforward and digestible way to describe what happened to their constituents.""English words are easier to understand than Latin words,"" said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut.Asked if Democrats were successfully bringing the public along with them, Ms. Pelosi conceded that the country was likely too polarized to ever support impeachment as overwhelmingly as it did when President Richard M. Nixon resigned in 1974. Public opinion polls now suggest a majority of Americans favor the impeachment inquiry, but only by a thin margin.""Impeaching is a divisive thing in our country -- it's hard,"" Ms. Pelosi said. ""The place that our country is now, it's not a time where you'll go to 70 percent when President Nixon walked out of the White House.""Indeed, there was no sign from congressional Republicans that the testimony had shaken their conviction that Mr. Trump is innocent.Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader, told reporters that the hearing had only confirmed that the accounts from Mr. Taylor, Mr. Kent and other witnesses who have offered damaging information about Mr. Trump are not firsthand, and therefore could not be trusted. And he pointed to the July phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky that is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry as exculpatory, despite Democrats' claims to the contrary.""The call summary is still the most important piece of evidence we have, and it shows no pressure or even mention of conditionality between the two leaders,"" Mr. McCarthy said.In an interview, he added that he did not put much stock in Ms. Pelosi's use of the term ""bribery"" either.""Wait 'til tomorrow 'til she makes a new term, because every term she brings forward, there's no proof behind it,"" he said.Julian E. Barnes and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.PhotographSpeaker Nancy Pelosi cited ""devastating testimony."" (A1); Speaker Nancy Pelosi clarified the case against President Trump. ""The bribe is to grant or withhold military assistance in return for a public statement of a fake investigation into the elections,"" she said. ""That's bribery."" Representative Kevin McCarthy, left, the minority leader, said witnesses' testimony confirmed only that the accounts are not firsthand and could not be trusted.

| Jump to first hitKIEV, Ukraine -- When two elderly women started shouting at President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday, interrupting questions from journalists about his summer call to President Trump with complaints about a local mayor, the young Ukrainian leader made clear where his priorities lie.Mr. Zelensky, whose political party is called Servant of the People, abandoned the journalists and his exasperated press secretary and went over to hear the women out, ordering his aides to take down their information and determine how to address their concerns.The scene unfolded in the course of a daylong news conference that Mr. Zelensky hosted at a food court in central Kiev, part of an effort to take back control of his narrative and refocus attention on domestic priorities amid the firestorm surrounding his interactions with President Trump.This is not where Mr. Zelensky expected to be when he took office last May. A popular comedian and actor, who played a president on TV before he entered the race for Ukraine's actual presidency last year, Mr. Zelenksy had anticipated becoming embroiled in ferocious battles with Ukraine's oligarchs over endemic corruption and going head-to-head with Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin.In the past, America's support as he faced down these challenges and attempted to break Ukraine's cycle of instability and dysfunction would have been a given. No more.""Right now, I am in the center of world media,"" he said at the news conference. ""I really wanted to be world famous, but not because of such a situation.""With locals milling about on their lunch hours, Mr. Zelensky spent the day on Thursday holding court in front of a barbecue restaurant, hosting a rotating series of small panels with local and foreign journalists. He tried to focus the conversation on the bread and butter issues that both he and most Ukrainians say they elected him to address: rampant corruption, crumbling infrastructure and a war against Russian-backed separatists that continues to bleed the country of lives and treasure.The war has cost 13,000 lives, led to the loss of the Crimean peninsula, which was annexed in 2014. Large swathes of eastern Ukraine are under control of separatists backed by Russia.""What kind of president did society elect?"" Mr. Zelensky said to journalists on Thursday. ""A president that will end the war. This is my mission for the next five years.""He fielded questions about organized crime in the city of Odessa and the continued presence in his government of high-ranking officials who have long been stained by corruption. And he was asked repeatedly about Ihor Kolomoisky, a billionaire and former business partner of Mr. Zelensky, whose looming influence over his administration is at odds with his promises to finally expel the oligarchs from power.All the while, members of the public meandered around just a few yards away, buying muffins and occasionally yelling out questions or complaints of their own. The event had the appearance of Mr. Zelenky's favorite medium: theater.""Zelensky won the election on the message that, 'I am not a typical politician -- I am the anti-politician, I am the man of the people,""' Volodymyr Yermolenko, editor in chief of Ukraine World, said in an interview. ""Therefore, he should communicate with media without symbols of power. That was the idea behind the whole theater.""But time and again, journalists steered him back to Mr. Trump and Ukraine's role in an impeachment inquiry that has threatened to engulf not one but two presidencies. As Mr. Trump fights for his political life and legacy in the United States, Mr. Zelenksy has had to contend with the fallout in Ukraine and his place at the center of an enormous political scandal raging thousands of miles away.So far, he has handled the challenge with poise, observers say, and a little bit of the wry sass that made him famous in his home country.After a partial transcript of his call with Mr. Trump was released, showcasing his somewhat awkward efforts to make nice to President Trump, he joked that he didn't know the White House would publish his part of the conversation. And with American TV networks clamoring for an on-camera exclusive with the man at the center of the drama, Mr. Zelensky chose instead to sit for an interview with Kyodo, a Japanese news service.It is difficult to gauge fully how the impeachment inquiry in the United States has affected Mr. Zelenksy's standing with Ukrainians, though a poll published this week by the National Democratic Institute found that 67 percent of respondents trust or fully trust the president. For many, the drama in faraway Washington can feel remote next to more pressing local questions.""This isn't something that we really talk about in Ukraine,"" said Valeria A. Gontareva, the former head of Ukraine's Central Bank.""We had 20 banks involved in money laundering that we closed,"" she said. ""Let them investigate that.""Mr. Zelensky has received far more scrutiny over his handling of the conflict with Russia than anything involving Mr. Trump. Last weekend, thousands of Ukrainians gathered in central Kiev to protest after Mr. Zelensky signed onto a proposal to grant a degree of autonomy to separatist regions as long as they hold elections deemed free and fair by international observers. Critics have derided the move as capitulation to Russia because the deal includes no timeline for a pullback of Russia's forces.Mr. Zelensky is also pursuing a policy of disengagement along the front with Russia by moving Ukrainian front-line trenches back several thousand yards, intended to decrease casualties from snipers and skirmishes and reduce danger to civilians in these areas. Critics accuse the president of giving up territory hard-won by Ukrainian.Konstiantyn Marchenko, 46, a veteran who turned up at the protest against Mr. Zelensky's peace plan last Saturday, called the him a ""traitor and a puppet"" -- not for obsequiousness to Mr. Trump, but to Mr. Putin.Of course, fallout from the impeachment proceeding in the United States will continue to cast a shadow over Mr. Zelensky's presidency.Pressed on the issue on Thursday, Mr. Zelensky again denied he had felt any pressure from Mr. Trump to open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, and said he ""didn't care what happens"" in the case of Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company that once employed Mr. Biden's son. In the phone call, President Trump had asked Mr. Zelensky to do him a ""favor"" and investigate the debunked theory that Mr. Biden had directed Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who had set his sights on the company.Mr. Zelensky also insisted that Mr. Trump did not seek to blackmail him over military aid, saying he was not aware at the time of the call that Mr. Trump had put a hold on nearly $400 million meant to bolster Ukraine's fighting ability, and that the topic had not come up.Mr. Trump's decision to delay the release of the military aid is one of the central questions in the impeachment inquiry being pursued by Democrats in the House of Representatives. At issue is whether Mr. Trump sought to use the assistance as leverage to pressure Mr. Zelensky's new government to open investigations into Mr. Biden, one of the president's leading opponents in the 2020 elections.If that was the intended message, Mr. Zelensky does not seem to have received it. The Ukrainian president said that after he became aware of the issue, he raised it, first with Vice President Mike Pence at a meeting in Poland, and then with Mr. Trump directly during a meeting at the United Nations in September.Pressed on the now debunked conspiracy theory promoted by some of Mr. Trump's supporters that it was Ukraine -- and not Russia -- that was guilty of interfering in the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Zelenksy said that he had no intention of meddling in any country. He warned other countries to stay out of Ukraine's internal affairs as well.""You chose your president yourself,"" he said, in response to a question from an American journalist. ""And, if I may say so, you will not now, or in the future, influence the elections of an independent Ukraine.""Maria Varenikova contributed reporting.PhotographPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine told reporters Thursday that President Trump didn't seek to blackmail him over military aid.

| Jump to first hitThe Democratic presidential candidates don't want to simply defend abortion rights. They want to go on offense.The Democratic presidential field has coalesced around an abortion rights agenda more far-reaching than anything past nominees have proposed, according to a New York Times survey of the campaigns. The positions reflect a hugely consequential shift on one of the country's most politically divisive issues.Every candidate The Times surveyed supports codifying Roe v. Wade in federal law, allowing Medicaid coverage of abortion by repealing the Hyde Amendment, and removing funding restrictions for organizations that provide abortion referrals. Almost all of them say they would nominate only judges who support abortion rights, an explicit pledge Democrats have long avoided.Very few support restrictions on abortions late in pregnancy. Seven say abortion pills should be available over the counter. Nine want a federal approval process for state abortion laws. And Joseph R. Biden Jr., whose ambivalence on abortion rights has been a theme for decades, is seeking to recast himself as a full-throated champion of them.The 2020 candidates' responses reflect a fundamental change in the Democratic Party's approach to reproductive issues. In other areas, from health care to taxes, there is a divide between liberal and moderate candidates. Here, it is minimal.""What you've seen is that it's no longer O.K. for any candidate just to say they're pro-choice,"" said Jacqueline Ayers, vice president for government relations and public policy at Planned Parenthood. ""They're being very specific on how our rights are under attack, how access to abortion is being undermined in this country, and putting forth plans to protect and expand rights.""With several states passing near-total bans on abortion, and with the first Supreme Court majority in a generation that could overturn Roe v. Wade, the Democratic candidates are at once agreeing that abortion rights require a more forceful defense, and concluding that defense is not enough.The ramifications are hard to predict. The public is strongly supportive of Roe v. Wade, but deeply divided on how accessible abortion should be beyond Roe's basic protections. President Trump has shown that he is willing to weaponize abortion to turn out his base, including through misleading or outright false narratives. And historically, abortion has been a bigger motivator for conservative voters than liberals.Whether any of this changes in 2020 will depend, in part, on how the Democratic nominee talks about abortion rights, particularly in battleground states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin where many swing voters are not as far to the left on abortion as the candidates.""You can't rule out that it could become an issue,"" said Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin & Marshall College Poll in Pennsylvania, ""depending on the candidate and to what degree they move it forward as an issue.""A basic reframingThe most striking change, beyond individual policies, is how unapologetic candidates' tone on abortion rights has become.Advocates have traditionally said they support the right to choose abortion, not abortion itself, and Democrats have said it should be ""safe, legal and rare."" Public debate has commonly centered on procedures after 20 weeks' gestation, which account for less than 1.5 percent of abortions. The discussion has often been on opponents' terms.Now, almost every candidate says the next president should actively reframe the debate. Their language focuses on health care, bodily autonomy and, at times, even the idea of abortion as a positive force enabling women to control their lives and increase their economic security.""Abortion is health care, and health care is a human right,"" Elizabeth Warren wrote in her survey response. In the last debate, she argued that abortion rights were ""also economic rights.""Only Tulsi Gabbard, Joe Sestak and Marianne Williamson now say abortion should be ""safe, legal and rare"" -- a phrase, popularized by President Bill Clinton and repeated by Hillary Clinton, that reflected a search for common ground with people not fully supportive of abortion rights.The rest of the 2020 candidates sidestepped or rejected the ""rare"" part. Bernie Sanders, for instance, wrote, ""Abortion should be safe, legal and accessible to every person who chooses it.""Asked if they supported restrictions after 24 weeks -- roughly when a healthy fetus can survive outside the womb, though viability varies from pregnancy to pregnancy -- only Mr. Sestak said yes. (Ms. Gabbard, who did not complete the survey, has also said she supports restrictions in the third trimester.) Several candidates emphasized that less than 1 percent of abortions happen that late, often because of life-threatening conditions or severe fetal abnormalities.Amy Klobuchar's campaign did not fully answer the question, saying she believed ""any restrictions must be consistent with Roe v. Wade.""Roe allowed near-total bans in the third trimester as long as there was an exception for life- or health-threatening situations. Planned Parenthood v. Casey replaced the trimester framework with one based on viability, which can start in the late second trimester.An emboldened defenseFor years, the battle over the Supreme Court has been conducted in code. Republicans denounced ""judicial activism"" and Democrats called for justices who would ""respect precedent"" -- that they were talking about one precedent in particular remaining unsaid.Not anymore.In May, Kirsten Gillibrand vowed to nominate only judges who would uphold Roe v. Wade. Though she is no longer in the race, her pledge is: All of the candidates who completed the survey said they would ""require judicial nominees to support Roe v. Wade as settled law.""Mr. Biden's campaign brought up his role in blocking Robert Bork's confirmation to the Supreme Court in 1987, which probably would have meant the end of Roe. Mr. Biden's objections then were more about birth control than abortion -- but his eagerness now to play up the latter is telling of how profoundly the Democratic terrain has shifted.Also telling is that the candidates are not solely talking about preserving Roe: In an acknowledgment that the Supreme Court might have enough votes to dismantle it, they all support legislation to codify its protections.Every candidate who responded wanted to ban states' so-called TRAP laws (an acronym for targeted regulations of abortion providers). These measures -- requirements that providers have hospital admitting privileges, for instance, or that hallways be a certain width -- don't technically restrict abortions but have the effect of making it harder for clinics to remain open.And a majority endorsed a federal preclearance requirement for state abortion laws, which Ms. Harris proposed in May. Only Andrew Yang and Joe Sestak definitively rejected it.Preclearance, which would block the laws in question until the Justice Department approved them, could stop TRAP laws as well as waiting periods and mandatory ultrasounds. It would also pre-empt bans like Alabama's and laws like Georgia's (both blocked by courts for now) that forbid abortion after six or eight weeks, before many women know they are pregnant.A shift to offenseThe idea of expanding abortion rights, not just maintaining them, was in the wings of the debate until recently. Now, it is center stage.Like every Democratic president in the past 35 years, the candidates (except Ms. Gabbard) have all pledged to repeal the Mexico City policy, or global gag rule, which blocks foreign aid to organizations that provide abortion referrals or promote abortion rights. All of them want to undo President Trump's Title X rules, which similarly restrict family planning funding for organizations within the United States.But they have also gone further. All of them want to repeal the Hyde Amendment, which blocks Medicaid coverage for abortion in most circumstances. Twelve want to repeal the Helms Amendment, which has prevented foreign aid from being used to cover abortions since 1973. (Mr. Biden's campaign did not answer that question.)Nine candidates want to require private insurers to cover abortion, though Mr. Biden's campaign again declined to answer, Ms. Klobuchar said she was unsure and Mr. Sestak said no.And seven said the drugs misoprostol and mifepristone, which induce abortions, should be available over the counter.This would be a major leap from current policy, which restricts the drugs' availability even by prescription, and would require multiple legal and regulatory changes. But if enacted, it would make it much harder to effectively ban abortion.Betting on public opinionA common thread in the candidates' answers was a firm belief that the public is on their side.Whether that is true is a complicated question, likely to play out next year as many elections since 2016 have -- in the growing chasm between rural and suburban voters.""A lot of his white, working-class voters are not in favor of abortion,"" Mr. Madonna said of the president, but ""suburban voters tend to be more liberal on a whole array of cultural issues.""On the basic tenet that Roe v. Wade should stay, Democrats are on solid ground: Polls show that anywhere from 60 percent to more than 75 percent of Americans support Roe.But there is much less support -- 20 to 30 percent, generally -- for making abortion always legal, as the candidates advocate. That's more popular than making it always illegal, but most Americans are in between.Even among Democrats, according to Gallup, ""legal under any circumstances"" is a minority position, ranging from 39 to 46 percent in the past couple of years. Among independents, that number is about 25 percent.So it is noteworthy that, in a historically large field, there is little differentiation among the candidates on abortion rights -- even among the more moderate candidates who, on other issues, have emphasized courting swing voters.""They're setting the tone that this is something we should own proudly,"" said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, ""and not just react to when something happens.""HOW WE COLLECTED THE DATAThe New York Times sent a survey to 16 Democratic candidates on Nov. 5. Eleven completed it. For those who did not -- Steve Bullock, Julián Castro, John Delaney, Tulsi Gabbard and Kamala Harris -- we examined publicly available information from policy papers, debates and interviews.The survey was conducted before Michael R. Bloomberg and Deval Patrick entered the race.PhotographA protest in Georgia in May after the state legislature passed a bill severely restricting abortions.

| Jump to first hitAs the House takes another step toward impeaching President Trump, concern is increasing that trying to remove a president will become a more common partisan tool.WASHINGTON -- It was a powerful congressional weapon deployed in only the most extreme cases, so explosive that lawmakers feared the wider damage it could do if used for the wrong reasons. Today, the filibuster is an everyday part of Senate business, standard operating procedure in a polarized world where the once rare has become commonplace.With the House poised to impeach President Trump on a mainly party-line vote and Republicans already threatening retribution, fears are mounting that presidential impeachment might, like the filibuster, become a regular feature of America's weaponized politics, with members of the party out of the White House but in control of the House routinely trying to oust a president they find objectionable.The escalating use of the filibuster and the rising toxicity of Supreme Court confirmation hearings are examples of how scorched-earth politics can be hard to extinguish once one party feels aggrieved and gets the opportunity to exact revenge.Those grievances were on full display Thursday during the 14 hours of debate in the House Judiciary Committee over articles of impeachment. It was a discussion full of vitriol and invective that ended with the panel's chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, gaveling the session to a close without a vote.Earlier in the week, Representative Louie Gohmert, Republican of Texas, suggested that Republicans could easily go after a Democratic president if control of the White House and the House were flipped. ""We've already got the forms, all we have to do is eliminate Donald Trump's name and put Joe Biden's name in there,"" he declared on Monday.Presidential impeachment was once almost unthinkable because of the gravity of overturning the results of an election. For more than two centuries, only one president -- Andrew Johnson in 1868 -- was subjected to a Senate trial. It became more common in the political lexicon after President Nixon resigned in the face of impeachment in 1974.After President Bill Clinton's impeachment, trial and 1999 acquittal, some opponents of his next two successors, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, unsuccessfully raised calls to impeach them. In 2016, some top congressional Republicans discussed impeaching Hillary Clinton before the election was even held. And, as House Republicans have frequently mentioned, some liberal advocacy groups were calling for Mr. Trump's impeachment in the days before his inauguration in January 2017.""The question going forward, of course, will be whether the Trump impeachment conditions the public to understand impeachment as a tool of normal politics, or whether it retains its exceptional character,"" said Josh Chafetz, a constitutional law professor at Cornell Law School. ""The Clinton impeachment does not seem to have been enough to make it a tool of normal politics, but maybe this time will be different.""Top Democrats acknowledge being torn. Speaker Nancy Pelosi recalled recently that she was under pressure to initiate impeachment proceedings against Mr. Bush for invading Iraq on the false premise of weapons of mass destruction, but she resisted.""I just didn't want it to be a way of life in our country,"" she said during a town hall on CNN.Rahm Emanuel, who served in the Clinton White House during the impeachment, agrees that there is a risk that ""we are going to normalize impeachment and it is going to have a cascading effect in the way Bork became a term,"" he said, referring to Robert H. Bork, the Supreme Court nominee rejected after a fiery 1987 hearing that inflames conservatives to this day.But like Ms. Pelosi, with whom he later served in the House leadership, Mr. Emanuel said the greater risk was to ignore what he considered egregious and clearly impeachable behavior by the president.""You have to weigh both of those and realize that you cannot as a country of laws allow someone to conduct themselves as if the law doesn't apply to them,"" Mr. Emanuel said.Democrats believe the brazen acts of Mr. Trump, captured on a White House transcript pressing a foreign leader to investigate a presidential rival while he was withholding desperately needed military aid, were so blatant that an impeachment vote was required despite its potential future consequences. They see the case against Mr. Trump as a textbook example of why the founding fathers created impeachment, and consider it far worse than Mr. Clinton's case, in which he was accused of lying about his sexual relationship with an intern.Yet Republicans view the current episode through the opposite lens, saying that the Republican-led impeachment of Mr. Clinton was fully justified while the action against Mr. Trump is purely political and unsupported by the evidence.""President Clinton committed a crime, perjury,"" Representative Steve Chabot, an Ohio Republican who voted to impeach Mr. Clinton in 1998, said Thursday as the House Judiciary Committee drafted articles of impeachment against the president. ""This president isn't even accused of committing a crime.""The case of the filibuster is instructive, though, unlike impeachment, the power to filibuster is not laid out in the Constitution. A distinguishing characteristic of the Senate, it was used very sparingly for decades -- most notoriously to block social legislation such as civil rights bills.But as control of the Senate shifted back and forth in the past 20 years, use of the filibuster grew along with polarization as both parties employed it to block judicial nominations and legislation.A supermajority requirement on nearly all major matters became essentially automatic. The judicial fights reached a point in 2013 where Democrats abolished the 60-vote threshold on most nominations and Republicans then eliminated it in 2017 for Supreme Court nominations. Some progressives are now suggesting that it be eliminated for legislation as well if Democrats retake the White House and Senate, arguing that any new Democratic initiatives would otherwise simply be bottled up by Republicans.Of course, the opportunity to employ the filibuster occurs much more frequently than a presidential impeachment. Impeachment would most likely require a special set of circumstances such as now exists, with the House controlled by a party clashing with the president of another. And the national spectacle of a full-blown impeachment proceeding and trial, as Republicans learned in the Clinton case, carries much more significant political risks than quietly blocking legislation on the floor of the Senate.On Thursday, Representative Kelly Armstrong, Republican of North Dakota, recited a litany of past presidents of both parties who had drawn charges of abusing their power but were not impeached, and cautioned his colleagues that impeachment was becoming ""the new normal.""""In the history of our country, the party who is not in the White House has accused the White House of abuse of power,"" Mr. Armstrong said. ""It started 200 years ago, it will continue into the future, except now, congratulations, it will be impeachment every single time one party controls the House of Representatives and the other party is in the White House.""Ms. Pelosi's initial reluctance to pursue impeachment -- suggesting it would be too divisive and should be thoroughly bipartisan -- suggests that no party would want to enter into impeachment lightly.""I don't buy the argument that just because we have the incident of bad behavior by a president that impeachment is necessarily built into our system now,"" said Wendy J. Schiller, the chair of the political science department at Brown University.""There is a threshold in the American public mind about what is overreach by the president of the United States on what is unacceptable behavior,"" she said. ""Using the Oval Office to get dirt on your opponent is something people can understand.""Republicans say what their voters understand is that Mr. Trump is being railroaded and that Democrats are simply intent on undoing a 2016 election result they found reprehensible.""The Pandora's box they have opened today will do irreparable injury to our country in the years ahead,"" Representative Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, said at Thursday's Judiciary Committee session.Congress is barreling toward a House impeachment vote and Senate trial where the results seem preordained. What cannot be known now is the future effect on American politics. But recent history shows these titanic clashes cause wounds that do not heal quickly and can lead to reprisals.PhotographWatching the House Judiciary Committee debate the articles of impeachment on Wednesday night.

| Jump to first hitPrevious presidents made an effort to make a distinction between the two and had their campaigns, not taxpayers, foot the bill for political events.WASHINGTON -- President Trump traveled on Air Force One to Florida one day last month to pitch an executive order aimed at improving private Medicare plans when he launched into a series of broadsides against some of his possible Democratic opponents.""Elizabeth 'Pocahontas' Warren. You know, when I used to hit her, I thought she was gone,"" he said to a crowded ballroom of elderly voters. But Ms. Warren ""came up from the ashes."" As for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., he said, he couldn't ""see Sleepy Joe making it, I'll tell you.""Past presidents sought to maintain at least an appearance of a separation between official and political business.But Mr. Trump has not just blurred the lines between the two. He has turned presidential speeches into political ones, and official trips around the country into campaign opportunities, complete with taunts of his rivals, riffs about his enemies, pleas for votes and fear-mongering about what will happen if he loses.On Friday, Mr. Trump traveled to Atlanta for an overtly political event: he delivered remarks at the Black Voices for Trump Coalition Rollout, and the campaign paid for his travel. But there have been many other events that were not designated as campaign events, but may as well have been. And for many voters, that's part of his appeal.""He knows there's a core that adore him, but also a sizable number of people that want to see Washington disrupted,"" said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University. ""This merging of the political with the official works with that narrative.""In the past, presidents went out of their way to ensure their official remarks did not veer into political territory. Copies of speeches were meticulously edited by the White House Counsel's Office, which would flag lines that could violate the Hatch Act, a Depression-era law that prohibits federal employees from engaging in political activities while on the job.The president is not subject to the Hatch Act but everyone who works for him is. Speechwriters and policy advisers who helped prepare those remarks, for instance, could be in violation of the act if they were crafting an overtly political speech for the president. But the Hatch Act is ultimately self-enforcing, and toothless if the president chooses to ignore warnings from White House lawyers about possible violations.President Barack Obama's aides said they took the law seriously.""The reason we were so cautious about it was the fear the campaign would then have to pick up the tab for the event,"" said Dan Pfeiffer, a former communications director for Mr. Obama. ""The Air Force One travel, the cost of the venue -- that's a huge bill to pick up for a stray sentence.""The Government Accountability Office, an independent investigative arm of Congress, and groups like Judicial Watch have estimated the hourly rate for flying Air Force One to be anywhere from $142,000 to $272,000.In a January report, the Government Accountability Office estimated that four trips Mr. Trump took from Washington to his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla. over a one-month period in early 2017 cost federal agencies about $13.6 million. The Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security incurred most of those costs, which were covered by taxpayers just as Mr. Obama's annual personal trips to Hawaii or Martha's Vineyard, Mass., were.Presidents have often tried to defray the travel costs by tacking on an official event on the way to a campaign rally, and passing the bill onto the government. What they did not do was effectively turn an official event into a campaign rally.In the past, Mr. Trump himself has complained about taxpayers shouldering the cost of flying Air Force One when it was used for political purposes.""Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary,"" he wrote on Twitter on July 5, 2016. ""A total disgrace!""But a Trump campaign spokesman said the campaign has never been asked to reimburse the federal government for official travel that turned into an overtly political event.Speaking in Pittsburgh last month at an energy conference, Mr. Trump warned the crowd in the critical swing state of what would happen if a Democrat replaced him. ""Our vision is the exact opposite of what they want to do,"" he said. ""Many politicians in our country are targeting your industry and your jobs for, literal, total destruction.""It was an official White House event, but Mr. Trump lapsed into part of his standard rally banter, discussing his shift to a new campaign slogan. ""We were calling it, 'Make America Great Again,""' he said. ""We're calling it now 'Keep America Great.' We will keep it going.""A week later, as he addressed an audience at a historically black college in South Carolina, Mr. Trump launched into one of the staples of his rally riffs: ridiculing Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, two former F.B.I. agents involved in the Russia investigation, whom he refers to at rallies as the ""two great lovers"" who were secretly conspiring to stop his election. The aside had little to do with the ostensible purpose of the event: criminal justice reform.And at the Values Voters Summit in October, Mr. Trump attacked Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, as a ""pencil neck. You would not be impressed with him physically. But he's a crooked person.""Mr. Trump has also made it clear he doesn't think much of the laws in place designed to prevent politics from seeping into government work. After the Office of Special Counsel recommended that Mr. Trump fire Kellyanne Conway, one of his top White House aides, for repeated violations of the Hatch Act, Mr. Trump said he saw the situation differently and had no intention of seeing to it that his aide abided by the law.""It looks to me like they're trying to take away her right of free speech, and that's just not fair,"" he said in an interview on Fox News.It wasn't just Ms. Conway whose conduct he shrugged off -- Ryan Zinke, the former interior secretary, Dan Scavino, a White House aide, and Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, have all been found in violation of the Hatch Act, but not punished.During Mr. Obama's presidency, his housing secretary, Julián Castro, was also not punished for violating the Hatch Act by campaigning on government property. The rationale at the time was that Mr. Castro had acknowledged the ""inadvertent error.""A White House spokesman said all of Mr. Trump's official remarks are reviewed by the White House Counsel's Office, as they have been in previous administrations, and that his remarks, as written, are always in compliance with the Hatch Act.But the spokesman, Judd Deere, conceded that Mr. Trump ""may add to the prepared remarks during the event."" Any asides would not be subject to the law, he said.Former Obama aides dismiss the distinction as a pretense. ""Handing a sanitized speech to the authorities to sneak the goods through customs doesn't mean you're not sneaking the goods through customs,"" said David Axelrod, a former top adviser.Mr. Axelrod said that Mr. Trump's line-blurring amounted to a kind of remittance to his re-election campaign. ""It will over time give him an advantage,"" said Mr. Axelrod. ""He will be essentially subsidizing his campaign with public funds, just as he subsidizes his business with public funds.""Ever since his 2016 campaign, efforts to get Mr. Trump to stick to his prepared remarks as they appear on his teleprompter have failed. Now the president is surrounded by a group of aides who largely aim to let Trump be Trump, rarely even trying to make him stick within the boundaries of an official address.Speaking at Benedict College in South Carolina in October, an official presidential event in front of a handpicked audience of supporters, Mr. Trump belittled Mr. Obama's record on racial equity and claimed he had done more than his predecessor to help African-Americans.""Check out the last administration and see what they did for you,"" Mr. Trump said, recalling with pride his message to black voters in 2016: ""What the hell do you have to lose?""PhotographPresident Trump greeting the public at a shale conference in Pittsburgh, above. Mr. Trump's supporters at a speech in Florida, at left, last month. Since those events were billed as official White House business, his travel was not paid by his campaign.

| Jump to first hitMichael R. Bloomberg is poised to enter a race that has many voters anxious and searching for the perfect candidate. But do they need yet one more option?COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa -- Jackie Wellman worries that Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are too liberal to defeat President Trump, thinks Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., may be too inexperienced and, while she is fond of Joseph R. Biden Jr., she is also uneasy about his tendency to misspeak. ""I am worried about the top four candidates because they all have issues,"" said Ms. Wellman, a 54-year-old Iowa caucusgoer from West Des Moines who likes Senator Amy Klobuchar.Ms. Wellman is not the only Democrat who keeps finding flaws as she searches for the best candidate to win the White House.""Voters are holding back because just when they start to fall in love, they find something that gets them a little nervous,"" former Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago said. ""The reason it's so fluid is because they're still searching for the horse that can win.""

Michael R. Bloomberg believes that may be him. But Mr. Bloomberg's apparent decision to mount a late entry into the presidential race represents something more than just the robust self-confidence of a New York City billionaire; it's a manifestation of the Democratic angst that has been growing, particularly among moderate voters and party establishment figures.Mr. Bloomberg has jolted the Democratic primary, drawing fire from the leading liberals in the field who said he was trying to buy the presidency while posing a direct threat to the centrist candidacy of Mr. Biden. But he has also exposed the jitters among establishment-aligned Democrats who fear that the leftward turn of the party is endangering their chances of building a winning coalition.

For weeks, senior Democratic officials and donors have been musing about whether a new candidate could be lured in the race, a striking illustration of nervousness just three months before the Iowa caucuses. Some talked up Mr. Bloomberg and Hillary Clinton, but others wondered if Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio might make a late entry to unite a party splintered along ideological lines.And while some party leaders have muted their concerns in an effort to be neutral, that restraint has started to give way to open expressions of alarm. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been repeating the same mantra -- ""Remember November"" -- in private about focusing on winning the general election, and has told Democratic allies she was uneasy about a nominee running on Medicare for all.In an interview last week with Bloomberg News, the San Francisco-based speaker let her concerns slip, saying that creating government-run health care ""would increase the vote in my own district, but that's not what we need to do in order to win the Electoral College.""Many voters are just as uneasy. ""I like Elizabeth Warren,"" said Janet Mayo-Smith, 64, who was attending an event for Mr. Biden in Franklin, N.H., on Friday, before adding that she had concerns about whether Ms. Warren was too ""radical"" to win. She expressed some openness to Mr. Bloomberg, calling him ""a good candidate"" but also noting that it was late to join the race.Stanley Brown, 49, also from New Hampshire, called Mr. Bloomberg's move ""interesting."" Asked if there were too many voices in the race already, he replied ""no such thing.""""I'd consider anybody,"" he said.Yet if there is consensus around the high priority of finding the strongest candidate to take on Mr. Trump, there is less agreement among rank-and-file voters that the party needs a white knight to enter the race and rescue them. Interviews with Democrats across four states on Friday showed that many were content to pick from those who remained in the sprawling field.""I'm not sure what his logic is exactly,"" Ricky Hurtado, who attended a Hispanic voters forum in North Carolina that featured Ms. Warren, said of Mr. Bloomberg. Ticking through a number of the leading Democrats in the race, Mr. Hurtado, who is running for the state legislature next year, said, ""I think we have enough voices in the primary right now covering the majority of the spectrum in the Democratic Party.""In New Hampshire, where Mr. Biden and the businessman Andrew Yang were at the statehouse on a frosty day, filing paperwork to be on the state's primary ballot, voters mostly shrugged about Mr. Bloomberg, who on Friday filed paperwork to qualify for the Alabama primary. A few groused about a bloated field getting bigger.Carolyn Stiles, 75, said she worried that such a large field would make it difficult for Democrats to unify behind one candidate, and described Mr. Bloomberg's potential entrance into the race as ""unhelpful."" She said she was considering Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Senator Kamala Harris.To some center-left Democratic candidates in the race, though, a Bloomberg bid could prove more than unhelpful. Were he to finance a major advertising campaign, he could siphon support, news media attention and ultimately votes from the more moderate candidates, clearing a path for Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren.""I don't know who he hurts but it's not going to be Bernie or Elizabeth,"" said Senator Amy Klobuchar, who is hoping to establish herself in Iowa as a centrist alternative to Mr. Biden. ""We don't need another billionaire,"" she added.Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a co-chair of Mr. Biden's campaign, was even blunter.""It takes a whole lot of moxie to look at the Democratic field and say, 'None of them can be president and I'll enter the race and be the savior,""' Mr. Richmond said. ""What does Bloomberg offer that's different? It's not like he's 27 -- he's 77.""Mr. Bloomberg may not prove to be the tonic the party is looking for. His record on policing and economic issues, and his skepticism about the #MeToo movement, could alienate large swaths of the Democratic electorate. And he is choosing an unconventional path in the primary; his advisers signaled Friday that if he runs he's unlikely to compete in the first four states.But it is clear enough why he is tempted to run.Mr. Biden's unsteady performances in debates and on the campaign trail have undermined confidence in his ability to beat the president. They have hurt Mr. Biden's fund-raising and early-state polling while exacerbating what may be his biggest liability -- that at 76, he may not be nimble enough to beat an unpredictable figure like Mr. Trump. Mr. Buttigieg is gaining support in Iowa, but polls show he has yet to draw any sizable support from nonwhite Democrats.On the other flank of the party, Democrats are eyeing Mr. Sanders, a 78-year-old democratic socialist who just suffered a heart attack, and Ms. Warren, who is tightening her embrace around a pricey single-payer health care proposal that would terminate private insurance plans.Both candidates have large and devoted followings, but Democrats have not put forward avowedly liberal presidential nominees in decades; a new New York Times/Siena College poll showing Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders losing to Mr. Trump in some battleground states only further frayed nerves.""That frightened a lot of people,"" Terry McAuliffe, the former governor of Virginia and D.N.C. chair, said of the survey.Then came Tuesday's elections, in which Democrats had great success with mostly moderate candidates who posted large margins in suburban jurisdictions -- heightening the conviction among many that the party needed a centrist standard-bearer.Mr. Bloomberg's prospective run has mostly agitated Mr. Biden's supporters, who were already on edge over his fund-raising troubles, his dip in the polls in Iowa and Mr. Trump's unrelenting assault on him and his son Hunter.

 ""I don't like that,"" Marge Cudney, who came to celebrate Mr. Biden's filing for the New Hampshire primary, said of Mr. Bloomberg. ""He's going to divide the team and will weaken everybody. I think he could pull some people away.""Yet two former lawmakers who are supporting Mr. Biden -- Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania and Bob Kerrey, a former senator and governor of Nebraska -- spoke favorably about Mr. Bloomberg and said they would be comfortable with him as a candidate if Mr. Biden faltered.""I'm for Joe,"" Mr. Rendell said, ""but if something were to happen where Joe was no longer a candidate, which I don't believe is going to happen, I would enthusiastically consider the mayor as a good strong candidate, and I think he'd make a fine president.""And not every voter dismissed Mr. Bloomberg, whose advisers believe will be viewed more favorably once Democrats nationally become more familiar with his business career and record as mayor.Bryant Tolles, 80, of Concord, N.H., gave Mr. Bloomberg high marks for his political experience. ""I'm glad he entered the race,"" said Mr. Tolles, who is undecided, adding, ""They need another centrist who can appeal to the broad electorate.""For all the heartburn in a party that is often given to indigestion about its presidential field, polls show that Democrats are generally pleased with their options. In a Monmouth University poll released this week, roughly three-quarters of Democratic voters said they were satisfied with the field, while just 16 percent said they were not.Moderate and conservative Democrats were more likely to say they wished someone new would get in the race, but only 22 percent of them expressed discontent with their choices.What is more revealing is how many in the party are not yet settled on a candidate: The Times/Siena poll of Iowa, where voters are paying closest attention to the race, found that roughly two-thirds of likely caucusgoers could still be persuaded to change their minds.

The ranks of the undecided include Alan Seabrooke, 89, of Elgin, Iowa, who said, ""If you get somebody too far to the left, it scares people.""Alex Stroda, a 40-year-old from Ottumwa, Iowa, who called himself a ""leftist libertarian,"" was just as concerned about 2020 but for the opposite reason: He thinks too many of the candidates are not progressive enough.Mr. Stroda, a former vice chair of the Wapello County Democrats, who is considering Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mr. Yang, dismissed the logic behind a Bloomberg candidacy.""This notion that he needs to ride in on a white horse and save the Democratic Party from somebody who is too left-wing,"" he said, ""is just an extension of the problem we have understanding politics in America, where we have the Democrats tacking to the right as the Republicans tack farther and farther right.""Sydney Ember reported from Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Jonathan Martin from Washington.

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump and his allies are pushing debunked claims of corruption by Mr. Biden as a counternarrative to impeachment.President Trump's re-election campaign has run menacing and misleading ads this fall accusing Joseph R. Biden Jr. of corrupt dealings with Ukraine. Republicans in Congress are scrutinizing Mr. Biden's son, pressing the State and Treasury Departments for information about his work for a Ukrainian energy company. The president himself has unleashed a stream of unfounded accusations against the Bidens and pushed for them to appear at a potential impeachment trial in the Senate.As Mr. Trump faces impeachment for allegedly pressuring Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden, he and his allies are now turning those same claims about Mr. Biden and his son into a key element of their defense. And they plan to continue to hammer at the Bidens' Ukraine dealings as impeachment proceedings move into the new year.There is no evidence that the elder Mr. Biden, while serving as vice president, improperly intervened in Ukraine to benefit his son. But the president's advisers are betting that many voters will ignore the complexities of the allegations and absorb a simple message about a father using his influence to help his son, a senior Trump campaign official said.The barrage of attacks is the latest example of Mr. Trump's monthslong fixation with Mr. Biden, who leads the Democratic field in national polling and has bested the president in head-to-head surveys in several key battleground states. Mr. Biden and many independent experts have called the allegations of corruption false, and Mr. Biden's campaign insists that they demonstrate how worried the president is about facing him in a general election.But the prospect of a public airing of the White House's corruption claims lasting into the primary season worries some Democrats, who see a parallel to Republican efforts to tarnish Hillary Clinton over her email practices in the run-up to the 2016 election. That campaign, they say, proved how damaging a constant stream of insinuations and accusations from Mr. Trump and his allies can be.""The tactic is very similar,"" said Karen Finney, a Democratic consultant and former Clinton campaign senior spokeswoman. ""Republicans were doing all they could to amp up the questions about her emails. They didn't necessarily argue the facts. All they had to do was throw in the question to raise doubts.""Some voters at Mr. Biden's campaign stops in recent weeks were keenly aware of that history.Kristin Tracy, 50, who attended an event with Mr. Biden in Des Moines, said that ""there must be something to Joe that's scaring the president, the current president, or he wouldn't be trying to drum up those investigations against him with the Ukrainians.""Still, she allowed, the scrutiny of Mr. Biden made her nervous.""It obviously worked against Hillary Clinton,"" she said of Mr. Trump's attacks. ""There's a lot of people that don't know, believe in blind faith what's said on Fox or out of the president's mouth.""Hunter Biden did hold a lucrative position on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma while his father was vice president, and while there is no evidence of wrongdoing, the arrangement struck some Obama administration officials as unseemly given the elder Mr. Biden's role in Ukraine policy.Now, some Democrats worry that a continued spotlight on Mr. Biden's family will expose the former vice president's vulnerabilities against a president who relishes getting personal. On Thursday in Iowa, Mr. Biden engaged in an angry exchange with a voter who falsely accused Mr. Biden of having ""sent"" his son to work in Ukraine, and of ""selling access to the president.""""You're a damn liar, man,"" Mr. Biden said.The moment showed Mr. Biden being forceful, at a time when some Democrats want him to more vigorously defend himself. But it was also an emotional and heated reaction to a predictable issue that Mr. Trump would be sure to press in a general election.The Trump campaign is divided over whether Mr. Biden will emerge as the nominee, the senior Trump campaign official said. Some remain convinced that Senator Elizabeth Warren will emerge as the standard-bearer. But others have noted that Mr. Biden hasn't collapsed despite months of scrutiny and a series of missteps, and see the entry of Michael R. Bloomberg, a billionaire who has already spent at least $50 million on television advertising since getting in the race less than two weeks ago, as representing the kind of chaos that will hurt lower-polling candidates, and not Mr. Biden.The campaign believes its message about Ukrainian corruption will help them even if Mr. Biden is not the nominee -- that it can be used to associate Democrats with a status quo that Mr. Trump ran against in 2016, and is hoping to again.Still, many Democrats say that Mr. Biden is better equipped to respond to Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans this cycle than the Democrats were in 2016.Mr. Trump is on the defensive himself, facing damaging revelations from the impeachment proceedings. Ms. Finney and other veterans of Mrs. Clinton's campaign also noted that the news media routinely describes many Republican claims about the Bidens as baseless, a difference from the tone of the coverage about Mrs. Clinton's emails in 2016 that has, so far, been helpful for Mr. Biden.And Mr. Biden, a longtime Delaware senator who had extensive bipartisan relationships on Capitol Hill, simply does not have the same baggage with congressional Republicans that Mrs. Clinton did dating to her time as first lady, some Democrats say.""Joe is not Hillary, and Hunter is not the candidate,"" said former Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat who is supporting Mr. Biden. He suggested the difference in dynamics between Mr. Biden and Mrs. Clinton was also partly due to sexism.Republicans plan to keep pressing for Mr. Biden to be called to testify, both to highlight the issue of Hunter Biden's consulting work and to suggest that Mr. Biden is being protected by Democrats in Washington.Asked whether he would appear voluntarily at a trial, Mr. Biden told reporters Wednesday: ""No, I'm not going to let them take their eye off the ball. The president is the one who has committed impeachable crimes, and I'm not going to let him divert from that.""The president's allies, in the meantime, have made clear they intend to make the Bidens the story. Senator Lindsey Graham's request to the State Department seeks to uncover new information about the Bidens' dealings in Ukraine. Senators Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin have pressed for documents from the Treasury Department seeking evidence of money laundering or fraud related to Hunter Biden's business payments.Spokesmen for Senators Graham, Grassley and Johnson did not grant interview requests.""The Bidens are in the middle of this,"" said David Winston, a veteran G.O.P. pollster who works with congressional Republicans. ""No matter which side you're looking at it from.""Mr. Biden, his advisers and his allies are making the case that Mr. Trump is attacking the former vice president because he fears him as a potential opponent. The very fact that Mr. Trump pressed the president of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens proves that point, they say.""I might say this is the only thing that Donald Trump and I agree on is the one he's most concerned about,"" said former Gov. Tom Vilsack, an Iowa Democrat who traveled with Mr. Biden on a weekend swing across the state.Mr. Biden has turned the issue into one of his most reliable applause lines on the campaign trail -- ""Donald Trump doesn't want me to be the nominee""-- and his campaign is eager for Mr. Biden to use Mr. Trump as a foil at every turn.Mr. Biden's campaign also argues that the Republican concerns about the Bidens' records in Ukraine didn't surface until politically convenient.""Republicans controlled both chambers for years after all of this became public and didn't say one word about it until Trump was exposed trying to blackmail Ukraine into bailing out his re-election campaign,"" said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the campaign.Those dynamics weren't enough to reassure Tom McGrane, 69, as he waited to see Mr. Biden at a campaign event in rural Denison, Iowa, last weekend. He said the Republican approach to Mr. Biden reminded him of another historical parallel: the 2004 presidential election, when the organization Swift Boat Veterans for Truth attacked John Kerry's military record.""As long as Republicans keep hammering on it, I think he needs to stop thinking it's just all going to go away,"" said Mr. McGrane, who said Mr. Biden should spend more time denouncing the Republicans' actions against him.Mr. McGrane told Mr. Biden just that after a speech here.""He said he understands it completely,"" Mr. McGrane recalled afterward. Mr. Kerry endorsed Mr. Biden on Thursday.Speaking to reporters recently, Mr. Biden briefly appeared to acknowledge the risk at hand, as he referenced a television interview Hunter Biden did earlier this fall.""He said, although he didn't do anything wrong, he wishes he hadn't had bad judgment because it allowed folks like Trump to try to change the focus,"" Mr. Biden said.He soon pivoted, saying, ""This is about Donald Trump and his corrupt behavior.""Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting from Cedar Rapids, Iowa.PhotographFormer Vice President Joe Biden meeting with supporters in Cedar Rapids, Iowa on Friday.

| Jump to first hitFor some Democrats, a key part of the former vice president's pitch is that their moderate friends and relatives like him, too.CRESTON, Iowa -- The voters at campaign events for Joseph R. Biden Jr. here in Iowa and across the country aren't just shopping for a candidate for themselves.As they jostle to take pictures with the former vice president and listen to him preach about national unity, they are often thinking about someone else -- a dad, a neighbor or a colleague. They consider the political leanings of people close to them who are uncomfortable with the most liberal presidential contenders, but who hate the chaos of the Trump era and are receptive to the kind of centrist, seasoned candidacy Mr. Biden offers.Some Democrats have been warning the party not to obsess over these potential swing voters, arguing that electability calculations about mythical undecided moderates are futile at this moment of extreme political polarization.But for many Biden supporters, those voters are their Republican-leaning relatives and friends. And their perspectives are an increasingly prominent consideration as the Iowa caucuses near.""I think he could get the independents and moderate Republicans who refuse to vote for Donald Trump,"" said Bailey Smith, 27, a leader in Atlantic, Iowa's business community and an undecided voter who attended a Biden campaign event on Sunday. Asked whether she had any moderate Republicans in mind, she replied, ""My dad.""It's a dynamic that helps explain why, despite Mr. Biden's series of missteps and uneven debate performances, many Democratic voters still believe the former vice president would stand the best chance against President Trump in a general election, polls show.That's a message Mr. Biden's top surrogates are sounding at every turn, citing specific potential swing voters in the process.""I always say that in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, if I didn't have Republican friends, I wouldn't have had any friends at all growing up,"" said Christie Vilsack, the former first lady of Iowa and a prominent Democrat, as she introduced Mr. Biden at a campaign stop here on Saturday night. ""Who will appeal to independents? And I want my candidate to be able to appeal to my Republican friends as well.""Her remarks came just days after Mr. Trump, with his nearly 90 percent approval rating among Republicans, was impeached largely along party lines after he asked a foreign nation to investigate Mr. Biden. Republicans who have long had warm relationships with Mr. Biden defended the president instead.For some Democrats, that development amounted to another reason for skepticism of Mr. Biden's emphasis on bipartisanship, and his claims that Republicans might have an ""epiphany"" with Mr. Trump out of office.Away from Capitol Hill, crossover voters are also a rare breed. But recent New York Times Upshot/Siena College surveys show that a narrow slice of swing voters does exist in key battleground states, as do voters who say they would be comfortable with Mr. Biden but not Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is more progressive. Mr. Biden continues to lead the national polls, too, though he has struggled in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire this fall.""There are a few candidates -- Biden, obviously, being one -- that could be attractive to disaffected Republicans and more centrist Republicans,"" said former Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida. He also mentioned Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.Mr. Biden's appeal to what some might call the ""reasonable Republican dad"" vote goes like this: He shuns far-reaching proposals like ""Medicare for all""; he has a history of working with Republicans; his warm personal style is disarming; and he represents a return to what some moderates view as a more stable era.A number of those factors are a liability among progressive voters, who are clamoring for bold change. But on the campaign trail with Mr. Biden, it's the centrist Republican and independent voters who are often top of mind for his supporters as they think about the general election.And according to a dozen Republican donors and strategists, as well as former elected officials who can speak free from concerns about retribution from Mr. Trump, there is some evidence that Mr. Biden can connect with these voters.""Oh yeah, he definitely does,"" said former Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a 2016 Republican presidential candidate, pointing to Mr. Biden's ability to speak to blue-collar voters. ""He is a guy who can do it probably better than any other Democrat.""Chuck Hagel, a Republican who served as defense secretary in the Obama administration, said he wrote in Mr. Biden's name on the ballot instead of voting for Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton in 2016. This year, he said, he favors Mr. Biden again, and would not back Mr. Trump -- or Ms. Warren, or Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- in the general election. It's a view shared by other Republicans, Mr. Hagel added.""They've said to me, 'If Biden is the nominee, I will vote for Biden, I will not vote for any of the other Democrats,""' recalled Mr. Hagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska, citing Mr. Biden's experience and his empathy. ""I don't know how big or deep or wide that is in this country, but I hear it.""At Biden campaign events, prominent supporters often instruct attendees to think in pragmatic terms, a stark departure from the fiery populist messages that animate events held by Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders.""It's not going to be you, it's not going to be me, it's not going to be the party faithful that turn this election -- it's going to be independents and moderate Republicans,"" Chris Louscher, a Democratic activist, told a crowd at a Biden event in Algona, Iowa, this month, thinking of her brother-in-law in Florida. ""I have a lot of family, a lot of friends, I have people in this audience today that are Republicans. They will vote for Joe Biden and that's how he wins this next election.""In recent days, Mr. Biden has been sharpening the contrast between himself and his Democratic rivals, using an addition to his stump speech to swipe at those who suggest that he is ""naïve"" for wanting to cooperate with Republicans -- the very Republicans, he acknowledges, who are attacking him, his family and his ""only living son.""On Friday, a reporter asked Mr. Biden for evidence that Republican officials and voters had any interest in working with him.""I think Republican voters have interest in finding common ground,"" he said. ""Wherever I go, there's an enormous number of independents and Republicans who know and think we have to find common ground.""It's not just Republican votes that Mr. Biden is seeking. Several longtime Republicans have donated to his campaign and held events for Mr. Biden, too.On Friday, Mr. Biden joined about two dozen people -- roughly half of them Republicans -- at a fund-raiser in Bel Air, Calif., hosted by Harry Sloan, a longtime Republican donor who supported Mrs. Clinton in 2016.""I've spoken to many Republicans who don't intend to vote for Trump,"" Mr. Sloan said. ""They're looking for an alternative. They are pretty polarized against Warren and Sanders and that so-called progressive wing of the party.""""And when those conversations come up, they tend to say, 'But I would vote for Joe Biden,""' Mr. Sloan said, adding that his event brought in $100,000.Yet there are clearly significant limitations to Mr. Biden's appeal across the aisle -- and to Democrats' guesses about how Republicans might feel.Some Democrats in the Des Moines area said they thought Douglas E. Gross, a prominent Iowa Republican, would be inclined to support a moderate like Mr. Biden.That was a surprise to Mr. Gross.""They'd have to do better than Joe Biden,"" he said in an interview this month. ""I just think his time has passed him by.""Then there was Marie Hansen of De Soto, Iowa, who said she was ""95 percent"" decided on Mr. Biden. But at a Sunday night campaign event, she also described a friend -- a now-disaffected Trump voter -- who has been swayed by Mr. Trump's criticisms of Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter. Ms. Hansen wondered about ""just finding that candidate she can settle with.""Many Democrats argue that it is not enough to settle for a candidate who could appeal to disaffected Trump voters or moderate Republicans. They say that without liberal enthusiasm, the party can't compete against Mr. Trump and his intensely committed base.Polls show several of the Democratic candidates doing well against Mr. Trump in hypothetical general election matchups. While the Biden campaign and his allies are making explicit overtures to Republicans, supporters of his leading opponents note that their messages, too, can cross strict party lines.Representative Andy Levin, a Michigan Democrat who is supporting Ms. Warren, said that her ""plan to end the corrupt system of self-dealing of the super rich is music to Republican, independent and Democratic ears.""Mr. Sanders, who has gained in recent polls, appeals to younger progressive voters as well as some of the blue-collar constituents both Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump are seeking to engage.""Iowans watched Donald Trump win by running as a fake Bernie Sanders, and they know the best way to beat the imitation is with the real thing,"" said Bill Neidhardt, Iowa deputy state director for Mr. Sanders.For all of the talk at Biden events about engaging independents and Republicans, Democratic attendees who hail from conservative areas tend to be the most skeptical that any Republicans are listening.Dianne Ballard, 63, of Centerville, Iowa, said she thought that Mr. Biden could defeat Mr. Trump, but also noted that many Republicans negatively associate him with former President Barack Obama. Ms. Ballard, a Biden supporter, did not plan to press the case with her husband, a Republican, over Christmas.""This is kind of Trump country, unfortunately,"" Ms. Ballard said. ""You're either one or the other.""PhotographA campaign rally for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Atlantic, Iowa, on Sunday. ""I want my candidate to be able to appeal to my Republican friends as well,"" said Christie Vilsack, left, the former first lady of Iowa and a prominent Democrat.

| Jump to first hitAs Trump made unfounded allegations about Biden and his son, the former vice president was torn over what to do. He now looks more vulnerable than at any point in the campaign.WASHINGTON -- Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s presidential campaign was under attack, and he and his advisers were torn over what to do.For more than a week, President Trump had been hurling unfounded accusations about Mr. Biden, his son Hunter and their dealings in Ukraine. Mr. Biden and his advisers debated whether to mount a fierce counterattack or to stick to a set of policy arguments he had been planning to roll out. Bad news loomed in the background: Mr. Biden's poll numbers had already grown wobbly, his fund-raising was uneven, and cable news was flashing chyrons by the hour showing Mr. Trump's wild claims.Mr. Biden himself was equivocating: He wanted to defend and protect his son, but he also believed the president was baiting him into a dirty fight. And as a lifelong adherent to congressional tradition, Mr. Biden was wary of acting hastily as an impeachment inquiry was getting underway.The strain grew so acute that some of Mr. Biden's advisers lashed out at their own party, taking the unusual step of urging campaign surrogates to criticize the Democratic National Committee -- a neutral body in the primary -- for not doing more to defend Mr. Biden, while the Republican National Committee was running TV ads attacking him. Frustrated, D.N.C. officials informed the Biden camp that it would continue denouncing Mr. Trump but would not run ads for Mr. Biden or any other candidate.The Biden campaign's tense deliberations reached a climax last weekend when Mr. Biden agreed to give a scorching rebuttal to Mr. Trump in a speech on Wednesday in Reno, Nev. But he delivered it well into the evening on the East Coast, and it was mostly lost amid another long day of Trumpian eruptions.To some Biden allies, it seemed too little too late: a case study in political indecision. Now Mr. Biden looks more vulnerable than at any point since he entered the campaign. Facing one of the greatest challenges of his candidacy, Mr. Biden has plainly struggled to meet the moment, or fully reconcile his own cautious instincts with his protectiveness of his family's privacy and his preference for taking the moral high road against Mr. Trump.Interviews with more than 50 Democratic strategists, lawmakers and lobbyists provide a portrait of a candidacy facing challenges on all sides, and one at risk of losing its core argument that Mr. Biden is the Democrat best able to defeat Mr. Trump in a general election.There is no evidence behind Mr. Trump's claim that Mr. Biden intervened inappropriately with Ukraine to help his son, but Democrats have been unnerved by the president's onslaught and Mr. Biden's halting response.In addition to the attacks from Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden's top rivals, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, each out-raised him in the third quarter by about $10 million. And as Ms. Warren has emerged as Mr. Biden's most formidable competition, Mr. Sanders, her main challenger for progressive support, just had a heart attack, casting uncertainty over whether he could siphon votes from Ms. Warren, as the Biden camp had hoped.Even before last week, Mr. Biden's advisers were acknowledging to donors that he may well lose both of the leadoff nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire.His communications aides contend that most voters were more focused on what Mr. Trump did to prompt the impeachment inquiry than on the false claims themselves. And they pointed to the former vice president's forceful attacks on Mr. Trump at a news conference Friday to argue that he was now ready to do battle with the president.""This guy like all bullies is a coward,"" Mr. Biden said. ""He does not want to run against me.""On Thursday, Mr. Biden, whose inner monologue rarely remains repressed, gave voice to the tension he is struggling with as he spoke at a fund-raiser in Palo Alto, Calif.Recalling the difficulty Hillary Clinton had in confronting Mr. Trump's campaign style, Mr. Biden worried about being ""sucked into the trap of the stuff that Trump was laying. He wants you in a mud fight.""""But when you respond to that,"" he continued, ""it brings you back down into that.""Mr. Biden was even blunter, and angrier, in private after news first emerged that Mr. Trump had exhorted the Ukrainian government to investigate him and his son.""I can't believe this guy is going after my family like this,"" he told Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, as the two campaigned in Iowa, Mr. Coons recalled.[ Sign up for our politics newsletter hosted by Lisa Lerer and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.]Leading Democrats have been pleading privately with Mr. Biden and his top aides to aggressively confront Mr. Trump, and expressing impatience with them for not seizing this opportunity to engage him in a two-man race. After all, Mr. Biden had spent months framing his candidacy as a singular crusade to oust an aberrant president.""It's time to really respond so everybody hears it,"" said Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a campaign co-chairman. ""If someone says something enough, people will start to believe it, and this president gets in his zone of telling a lie over and over again. You have to make sure people don't believe in it.""David Plouffe, former President Barack Obama's campaign manager, was mystified. Mr. Biden ""should use this moment and become Trump's opponent,"" Mr. Plouffe said. ""I don't understand it.""But Mr. Biden is confronting an almost unimaginable situation: the president he hopes to challenge is facing impeachment for urging another country to help smear him. What's more, the House inquiry centers on what Mr. Biden values most in his private and public life: protecting his family and honoring institutional norms.Several Democrats close to Mr. Biden say he did not take on Mr. Trump sooner in large part because of his reverence for congressional prerogatives -- he did not want to immediately insert himself into the House's jurisdiction. But Mr. Biden also sought to address the attacks on his son on his own terms rather than sit for hastily arranged television interviews that would have forced him to answer questions about Hunter Biden's work that few of his own aides dared pose.Now, just as his monthslong lead in the primary is eroding, he faces an opponent who's threatening his son, the political system he dedicated his adult life to and, as he approaches his 77th birthday, his last chance to become president.Worried about his familyFor Mr. Biden's campaign, no attack could have been more difficult to deal with than one involving the candidate's son.Mr. Biden nearly did not run for president because of the effect it would have on his family -- and particularly on Hunter Biden and his children, according to multiple advisers to the former vice president. Hunter Biden has struggled for years with substance addiction and had recently gone through a very public divorce from his first wife.In separate interviews, Mr. Coons and his fellow senator from Delaware, Tom Carper, both said they had warned Mr. Biden that the president would target his family.""He expected his family to be attacked,"" Mr. Carper said, adding that Mr. Biden assured him he was braced for ""the onslaught.""Mr. Biden's family, including his son, encouraged him to enter the race, knowing the attacks were inevitable. But as Anita Dunn, one of Mr. Biden's closest advisers, put it: ""When it happens, it still feels pretty lousy.""The Biden campaign has attempted to handle the candidate's son with great sensitivity. Mr. Biden made clear at the outset that Hunter, a lawyer who had long advised his father on his campaigns, should not be made to feel excluded, people who spoke with him said. One adviser to Mr. Biden recently telephoned his son to solicit advice on the upcoming debate in Ohio.But to most of Mr. Biden's aides, Hunter Biden has been a spectral presence. He is living in Los Angeles and stayed away from Mr. Biden's campaign launch in Philadelphia. Hunter Biden quietly attended the last two debates and appeared with his new wife, Melissa Cohen, at a July fund-raiser in Pasadena, Calif.Still, Mr. Biden's advisers are aware that Hunter Biden carries political vulnerabilities. His business career has intersected repeatedly with his father's political power, through roles he had held in banking, lobbying and international finance. Working for a Ukrainian energy company beginning in 2014, he was paid as much as $50,000 a month while his father was vice president, and some of Mr. Biden's admirers worry that, while Mr. Trump's accusations are without merit, voters may view Hunter Biden's actions as problematic.Even one of Mr. Biden's Democratic rivals, Beto O'Rourke, said on Saturday that he would not allow ""anyone in my cabinet to have a family member to work in a position like that.""In the past, Mr. Biden has bristled at questions about whether his family had benefited financially from his political career. He did so again on Friday when he was asked whether his son's work in Ukraine represented a conflict of interest. Pointing a finger at the questioner he said: ""Let's focus on the problem. Focus on this man, what he's doing, that no president has ever done. No president!"" The Trump campaign was soon circulating a clip of the episode.For his allies, it is both poignant and painful that Mr. Biden's family is again at the heart of his public identity. He lost his first wife and daughter, and nearly lost his two sons, in a car accident in the weeks after he was elected to the Senate in 1972. His final years as vice president, as well as his hopes to run for president in 2016, were overwhelmed by his elder son Beau's death from brain cancer.Jim Mowrer, a former Democratic congressional candidate from Iowa who served with Beau Biden in the military, said he spoke to Hunter Biden early this year and got the impression he was trying to focus on personal matters rather than the campaign. Mr. Mowrer said he saw the elder Mr. Biden in Iowa last month and they discussed not Hunter but his other son, Beau.""Beau's death is very, very fresh in his mind, and so now these attacks on Hunter are even more unsettling,"" Mr. Mowrer said.A big bet on South CarolinaThe politics of Ukraine and impeachment have been so costly for Mr. Biden, in part, because he is confronting so many other challenges in the Democratic race: a struggle to excite liberal primary voters, an ascendant rival in Ms. Warren and a decline in fund-raising that has forced him to spend even more time appealing to donors in cities hundreds of miles from the early primary states.Mr. Biden's campaign manager, Greg Schultz, acknowledged some of those problems in a briefing for Democratic donors at Morgan Stanley's New York office last month. Mr. Schultz assured the group that they had a path to the nomination that depended on winning South Carolina -- the fourth primary state -- and then scoring big victories in the Super Tuesday primaries in March.In South Carolina, where Mr. Biden's support appears strongest among the early-voting states, some of his supporters are discussing a trip to Iowa before Thanksgiving -- to vouch for the former vice president, and to emphasize his ability to appeal to minority constituencies, like African-Americans.""We probably know Joe Biden a lot better than they do,"" said State Senator Dick Harpootlian of South Carolina, a Biden supporter.Mr. Schultz acknowledged at the briefing that Mr. Biden had been uneven at times during debates and on the stump. Still, he predicted Mr. Biden would maintain an advantage over Ms. Warren, saying she would struggle to overcome the persistent competition on the left from Mr. Sanders.But Ms. Warren has recently pulled well ahead of Mr. Sanders. Now, even Mr. Biden's own campaign aides privately acknowledge that South Carolina may not be much of a political firewall if Ms. Warren rolls through Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.As he finds his way forward, Mr. Biden is relying on a circle of advisers, some formal and others less so, but there is no chief strategist. Mike Donilon, who wrote much of the Reno speech, may be the closest person to playing that role. Democrats who know Mr. Biden well say the campaign is mostly in his hands -- and he makes the final calls.While Mr. Biden's team has done little polling in the race, he is expected to conduct a survey of Iowa Democrats next week on the Ukraine issue ahead of a new advertising push in the state.Mr. Biden has begun to escalate his attacks on the president, and his campaign began airing a commercial hitting back at the president for trying to ""pick his opponent and face only the candidates he thinks he can beat."" Still, there is no final consensus, in Mr. Biden's camp, about how consistently he should confront Mr. Trump.""He's never gone negative,"" said William M. Daley, the former White House chief of staff, who worked on Mr. Biden's 1988 campaign. ""That's not him, that's the charm of Joe.""Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting from Los Angeles.Thomas Kaplan contributed from Los Angeles.PhotographJoseph R.

| Jump to first hitDemographically, they seem like people who'd want to vote out Trump. Yet at least in the battleground states, many favor Republicans.It is an article of faith for the activist base of both political parties: An ideologically pure candidate can win by turning out the base and mobilizing a new coalition of voters.For Democrats, nonvoters have long been a source of hope. They are disproportionately young, nonwhite and low-income, demographics that favor the party. In this year's Democratic primary, turning nonvoters into voters would seem to offer a path to victory for candidates who might seek to win the general election without persuading the moderate swing voters coveted by their party's establishment.There may be places in the country where this is true. But in the battleground states likeliest to decide the presidency, nonvoters aren't overwhelmingly favorable to Democrats, according to an analysis of 623 registered voters who live in battleground states and stayed home in both 2016 and 2018.These nonvoters participated in recent New York Times Upshot/Siena College surveys of the six closest states carried by the president.They lean Democratic, but only by a bit. The president actually leads Elizabeth Warren, 42 percent to 41 percent, among active registered voters who did not vote in either 2016 or 2018. Joe Biden leads this group by three points, and Bernie Sanders leads by four.Those nonvoters who say that, if they voted, they would vote for any of the three leading Democratic candidates seem no more likely to support progressive causes or a progressive nominee than recent voters. Just 13 percent of nonvoters who would vote for the Democratic nominee call themselves ""very liberal."" Nearly as many of these Democratic-leaning nonvoters, 8 percent, say they're ""very conservative.""The results suggest that higher turnout, though helpful to Democrats in their quest to defeat the president, would not necessarily assure them of victory in these states. And the president's ability to stay close among nonvoters suggests he could remain competitive in a high-turnout election and expand his support beyond his 63 million voters in 2016.The findings undermine the common assumption that Hillary Clinton lost simply because of low Democratic turnout. This month's Times/Siena polling does suggest she would have benefited from a higher overall turnout; the top Democratic candidates today lead among 2016 nonvoters by between three and eight points. But the relatively narrow Democratic advantage is consistent with a wide body of evidence that the election would have remained deadlocked, even if Democrats had enjoyed a turnout as favorable as the one they had in 2012.For Democrats, part of the problem is that the demographics of nonvoters no longer work so clearly in their favor. Nonvoters are less likely to have graduated from a four-year college, and the president excels among the less educated white voters who are overrepresented among nonvoters in the battleground states.But the Democratic challenge runs beyond demographics. In general, the nonvoters are less ideological and less partisan than demographically similar voters, which weakens the expected Democratic demographic edge.The president, for instance, has a 17 percent approval rating among self-identified Democrats who didn't vote in either 2016 or 2018, compared with an 8 percent approval rating among Democrats who did vote in either of those years. And Mr. Trump has a 19 percent disapproval rating among self-identified Republicans who didn't vote in either 2016 or 2018, and a 9 percent disapproval rating among those who did.The same pattern plays out by demographic group. The most striking case involves black voters: Those who turn out vote all but unanimously for Democrats, but the Democratic advantage is not quite so clear among those who haven't voted in recent elections.Mr. Biden leads Mr. Trump among nonvoting black registered voters by only 59 percent to 19 percent, but he is ahead, 89-5, among those who voted in both 2016 and 2018. The sample of black nonvoters is small, at just 72 respondents, but the difference is well outside the margin of error. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders underperform among nonvoting black registered voters by a similar level.What about whites without a degree, the president's base? Mr. Trump has a 25-point lead over Mr. Biden in this group if they have voted in one of the last two elections, 59 percent to 34 percent. Those who stayed home, however, back Mr. Trump by a smaller margin of 53 percent to 36 percent. The pattern holds after controlling for age.Taken together, the figures imply that a large portion of nonvoters sit out because they do not neatly line up with either party. This fact tends to limit the opportunity available to both parties, but over all it tends to diminish the Democratic advantage that would seem to exist based on their demographics alone.One exception to this general pattern is among Hispanic nonvoters, who tend to be just as Democratic as their voting counterparts, or even more so.Over all, Mr. Biden led among nonvoting Latinos, 64 percent to 24 percent, compared with a 63-30 lead among those who had voted in either 2018 or 2016. The sample of nonvoting Hispanic voters is fairly small, but the finding is consistent with data previously analyzed by The Upshot.As a result, Democrats enjoyed a far larger edge among nonvoters in our poll of Arizona, where 33 percent of registered nonvoters were Hispanic, than elsewhere in the battlegrounds. Mr. Biden led among nonvoters in Arizona, 55 percent to 37 percent, thanks to a 74-12 lead among Hispanic in that group. In the rest of the battlegrounds, Mr. Biden had only a one-point lead among nonvoters.The relative Democratic strength among Hispanic voters may also mean that nonvoters nationwide may be more Democratic than nonvoters in the battlegrounds, since nonvoters nationwide are likelier to be Hispanic. It may add further intrigue to speculation about Democratic prospects in Texas, where nonvoters are even more diverse than they are in Arizona.Of course, Democrats -- or Republicans and the president -- could benefit from higher turnout if it drew disproportionately from their pool of voters. The Times/Siena data confirms this has happened before.The group of voters who stayed home in 2012 and turned out for the presidential election in 2016 was fairly favorable to Republicans. Today, they back Mr. Trump by three points over Mr. Biden.The voters who stayed home in 2016, but turned out for the midterms in 2018, back Mr. Biden by 17 points in these battleground states. Today, they are just as likely to say they are ""almost certain"" to vote as those who turned out in 2016.So for Democrats in the primary, the question is not simply who leads among nonvoters, but what kind of candidate could excite them enough to lure them to the polls.The results do not offer particularly clear guidance here. On the issues, the nonvoting Democrats look about the same as those who vote. But the group looks relatively likely to include voters who have not been animated by the cultural fights of the last half decade, which might be something of a surprise given their relative youth.Nonvoters are the likeliest group of Democratic leaners to oppose an assault weapons ban or to support reducing legal immigration to the United States. They're likeliest to agree that discrimination against whites is as big a problem as discrimination against minorities, even though the group is only 50 percent white. They're also likeliest to agree that political correctness has gone too far.It's a combination that informs why this group is somewhat sympathetic to the president, even though they say they would probably vote for the Democratic nominee.Perhaps this shouldn't be a surprise: If they did care about the same things that animated ""very liberal"" voters, they probably would have gone to the polls in these crucial states. Eighty-six percent of very liberal registered voters turned out in either 2016 or 2018 in these states, the highest percentage of any ideological group.That said, there are some signs that Democratic-leaning nonvoters are somewhat likelier to favor a bold candidate who offers something different. In no small part because of their relative youth, they say they would prefer a candidate who promises fundamental, systematic change to American society over one who promises to return Washington to normal. In contrast, Democratic-leaning voters who turned out in both 2016 and 2018 prefer a return to normal.Young nonvoting Democrats are slightly more likely than young voting Democrats to support fundamental, systematic change over a return to normal. But in keeping with the broader pattern, they offer more conservative answers on the issues than those who vote.The gap is particularly stark on cultural questions. Among people under 30 who lean Democratic, the nonvoters are far more likely than the voters to agree that the women who are running for president ""just aren't that likable.""The pattern also extends to issues like immigration or health care. Over all, the young Democratic nonvoters are far less likely to describe themselves as very liberal.From all this, you could stitch together a case that Democrats have struggled to appeal to less educated nonvoters, particularly among those who are young and black. These nonvoters do not like the president and they are not conservatives, but they do not appear to have been socialized into the cultural norms of the party's liberal college-educated coastal base. As a result, they have not responded to the president's conduct with the urgency and outrage of their peers. And some of them may even dissent from their generation's progressive consensus on cultural issues.When it comes to the candidates, Mr. Sanders shows relative strength among nonvoters: He has a 41 percent ""very favorable"" rating in the group, compared with 33 percent for Mr. Biden and 30 percent for Ms. Warren. This is at least in part because of Mr. Sanders's longtime appeal to young voters.Not only is Mr. Sanders's favorability rating the best of these three candidates, but he is also the only Democrat whose favorability rating is stronger among nonvoting Democratic leaners than among those who have voted before. His outsider status and promise of fundamental change, without much focus on cultural issues, might offer at least one clue for how Democrats might appeal to these nonvoters, though it need not be the only one.Although Mr. Sanders's favorability rating is strong in both absolute and relative terms, it is not an overwhelming endorsement.Democrats also have an opportunity to draw on a different group of nonvoters: the millions who aren't registered to vote at all, and who stand on the sidelines of American politics.Their views are not measured here, but a prior Upshot compilation of 2018 polls from the Pew Research Center and Kaiser Family Foundation found similar patterns. President Trump's approval rating among unregistered black voters, for instance, stood at 19 percent, and at a surprising 47 percent among unregistered young voters.None of this precludes the Democrats from benefiting greatly from new voters, as they did in 2018.But the poll offers little reason to think these voters are poised to save them. Over all, 45 percent of nonvoting Trump supporters say they are ""almost certain"" to vote, compared with 46 percent of nonvoting Democratic leaners.PhotographWhat kind of people are likeliest to stay home on Election Day, and which party might benefit if they could be persuaded to turn out?

| Jump to first hitNew entrants into the race. A nod from Barack Obama. Centrist victories in governor's contests. Moderates sense a favorable shift.LAS VEGAS -- After spending months in anxious passivity, staking their hopes on Joseph R. Biden Jr. and little else, moderate Democrats appear suddenly determined to fight for control of their party in the 2020 elections.The shift in attitude has come in fits and starts over the last few weeks, seemingly more as an organic turn in the political season than as a product of coordinated action by party leaders. But each assertive act has seemed to build on the one before, starting with a debate-stage clash last month over ""Medicare for all"" and culminating in recent days with the entry of two new moderate candidates into the primary, Michael R. Bloomberg and Deval Patrick, and a gentle warning from former President Barack Obama that Democrats should not overestimate voters' appetite for drastic change.Most convincing to some Democrats may be the off-year elections this month in Kentucky and Louisiana, where moderate-to-conservative Democrats prevailed in governors' races that President Trump worked strenuously to win for his party. The victories bolstered the argument, advanced by some leading Democrats, that the party could peel away some of Mr. Trump's supporters in 2020 by avoiding ""litmus test"" battles and courting the political middle.""Clearly, factually, people who voted for Trump voted for our Democratic gubernatorial candidates,"" said Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island, a moderate who leads the Democratic Governors Association. She said Democrats could win those voters in 2020 with a ""message of unity"" and pragmatic promises on issues like health care and student debt.For months the Democratic race was defined in terms of which candidate could promise the most daring policy reforms -- a contest in which Mr. Biden, the former vice president, was struggling to keep pace with Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. As the most liberal candidates set the agenda, many in the party establishment squirmed, anxious about alienating moderate voters.Now the primary has become an increasingly jumbled contest, shaped by Democrats' competing appetites for visionary ideas, tactical realism and sheer political novelty. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., appears to be harnessing those tensions to his advantage, at least in Iowa, where for the first time he emerged as a clear front-runner in a CNN/Des Moines Register poll this weekend.In Nevada, where more than a dozen candidates were gathered for the state party's ""First in the West"" dinner, Representative Dina Titus was holding up the Democrats' off-year victories as a reason for optimism heading into 2020. But Ms. Titus, who has not endorsed a candidate in the presidential race, urged the presidential field to be mindful of the ""moderate Democrats in suburban districts"" who flipped control of the House last year.""We have just got to make sure that we appeal across the board,"" said Ms. Titus, who introduced both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders at events this weekend. ""We are a big-tent party.""That proved to be true this month, at least in Louisiana and Kentucky. The Democratic victors in both states, Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana and Andy Beshear, the governor-elect of Kentucky, ran on expanding health care coverage at the state level and largely avoided national issues, like impeachment. Mr. Edwards in particular positioned himself well to the right of the national Democratic Party, opposing abortion rights and new efforts to regulate firearms.No Democratic leaders believe either state will be in play at the presidential level in 2020, and few would argue that the party should shift as far to the right as Mr. Edwards in order to compete.But Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a leading supporter of Mr. Biden, said on Sunday that Democrats should take the election in his state as a sign that ""the country is not as far to the left as people would have us believe.""""If you look at Kentucky, if you look at Louisiana, it shows 2020 could be a very good year for Democrats,"" Mr. Richmond said, ""but we have to read the tea leaves right, learn the real lesson of what these races are saying.""Many Democratic voters still appear determined to find a Goldilocks-like option in the race -- a candidate who both generates excitement and soothes concern about the general election, someone who promises sweeping change but appears capable of winning Republican votes. Ms. Warren climbed in the polls for months on the strength of her reform message and a mastery of policy that conveyed reassuring competence, but her poll numbers have slipped recently amid intensive scrutiny of her health care plans.Ms. Warren has attempted to allay voters' reservations on that front in recent weeks by pledging not to raise middle-class taxes to pay for her plans. She also described how she would prioritize improvements to the Affordable Care Act, including the creation of an optional government health-insurance plan, before attempting to create a single-payer system.Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders remain among the best-positioned candidates in the primary election, with distinctive appeal to young people and other voters seeking a large-scale redraw of the political system -- an overlapping agenda that drew roars of approval at the ""First in the West"" dinner.At the dinner, both expressed disdain for incremental politics, with Mr. Sanders saying that ""tinkering around the edges just won't do what needs to be done"" and Ms. Warren dismissing more modest policies as ""a nibble here and a nibble there."" Both are polling at or near the top of the pack in three of the four early primary states, including Nevada.And both are actively working to persuade voters that their approach is the better bet in a general election, including by appealing to voters who feel alienated from the political system. ""If the best that Democrats can offer is business as usual after Donald Trump, then Democrats will lose,"" Ms. Warren said at a campaign stop here on Sunday afternoon. ""We win when we have solutions for the problems in people's lives.""Andrea Griffin, an elementary school nurse in Las Vegas, said she had been wary of Ms. Warren as a general-election candidate but came away feeling more confident after watching her on Sunday.""I was a little skeptical about a plan for everything, but she has a pretty good grasp on what the major issues are and I kind of think that she might be able to get it done,"" said Ms. Griffin, 56, a former independent voter who said she registered as a Democrat two weeks ago.Ms. Griffin said she was also curious about Mr. Buttigieg, but had essentially ruled out Mr. Biden, explaining, ""I think America is not ready to go back to business as usual.""While he is consistently leading national polls, Mr. Biden's vulnerability in the primary appears to come, at least in part, from his seeming inability to inspire Democratic voters. He is seen as a sensible and safe option, and a conventionally steady hand for the presidency.At the Nevada Democrats' dinner on Sunday evening, Mr. Biden urged primary voters to think cautiously: ""We'd better be real careful about who we nominate,"" he warned, ""because the risk of nominating someone who wouldn't beat Trump is a nation and a world that our children and our grandkids won't want to live in.""For a good number of primary voters, that appeal is persuasive enough: At Mr. Biden's town hall-style event in Las Vegas the night before, Phyllis Lind, a retired health care worker who is becoming a substitute teacher, explained her thinking about the race in terms that conveyed her party's conflicting impulses. She said she was drawn to Ms. Warren because she was ""for the common person,"" and to Mr. Buttigieg because he had personal charisma ""like Obama."" But at the moment, Ms. Lind, 73, said she was firmly supporting Mr. Biden.""We need to have a candidate that is going to also get the moderate Republicans,"" Ms. Lind said.At the moment, Mr. Buttigieg seems to be claiming an inchoate space that lies between Mr. Sanders's ideological movement and Mr. Biden's unapologetically tactical approach to the election. But his rise in the polls has been chiefly confined to the earliest primary states, Iowa and New Hampshire, and he has not generated interest among African-American and Latino voters, cornerstones of the Democratic coalition.At the dinner in Nevada, Mr. Buttigieg repeatedly struck the theme of unity, pledging to ""bring together an American majority"" for Democratic policies.His prepared remarks also included a rebuke seemingly aimed at Ms. Warren: the text circulated to reporters had Mr. Buttigieg saying that no one should be ""written out of a particular political party"" because of a policy disagreement -- an apparent allusion to Ms. Warren's recent barb suggesting Mr. Biden might be running in the wrong party's primary because of his attacks on the idea of single-payer health care.But Mr. Buttigieg did not deliver the line, instead saying he wanted support from people ""whether you are a progressive or a moderate or what I like to call a future former Republican.""Mayor John Cranley of Cincinnati, a moderate Democrat who supports Mr. Buttigieg, said he saw the shift toward Mr. Buttigieg as a function of voters' intense concern about defeating Mr. Trump.""I think that it's clear Democrats are focused on winning,"" Mr. Cranley said.Pointing to neighboring Kentucky, the northern bulge of which houses the suburban bedroom communities of his own city, Mr. Cranley argued that Mr. Beshear's victory with right-leaning voters there could be a case study for the national party.To win there, Mr. Cranley said, ""You can't have somebody who is to the far left on some of these issues.""Katie Glueck contributed reporting from New York.PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., top, holds appeal for moderate voters who see him as a sensible and safe option.

| Jump to first hitThe president took on the impeachment inquiry, Democrats and the news media in his first return to the state as a formal resident.SUNRISE, Fla. -- President Trump on Tuesday raged against the Democrats' impeachment inquiry, lobbed attacks at his adversaries in the Washington establishment and angrily defended his health during an unfettered, raucous rally that marked his return to Florida as a formal resident.Hours after the House invited the administration to present its defense next week in the impeachment investigation, the president railed against House investigators for being ""very sick and corrupt people"" unwilling to give him a fair chance to defend himself.""The failed Washington establishment is trying to stop me because I'm fighting for you,"" he told the roaring crowd, offering a key election battleground a fiery preview of what is probably going to be his foremost defense after a series of career officials testified that he had engaged in a pressure campaign to force Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. ""They're attacking me because I'm exposing a rigged system.""Mr. Trump also defended his decision this month to absolve three service members of war crimes, arguing that he had ""stuck up for three great warriors against the deep state.""He reserved the brunt of his verbal assault for a few regular punching bags: Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, who led the public impeachment hearings (""Shifty Schiff""); former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. (""Slow, Sleepy Joe"") and his son Hunter Biden (""Where's Hunter?""); and the news media (in one example, ""stupid, horrible, corrupt CNN"").And he took particular offense with coverage of his recent visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and speculation about his health, describing unverified reports that he had ""a massive, unbelievable heart attack."" He described at length the process of getting examined by doctors and being asked to ""take off your shirt, sir, and show us that gorgeous chest."" (Previous medical examinations have found that the president was in good health, but should also watch his weight and cholesterol levels.)""Hey, if I wasn't feeling great, I wouldn't be ranting and raving to 21,000, 22,000 people,"" he told the crowd, which broke into boisterous applause. Buoyed by a deafening soundtrack, the crowd frequently bellowed ""four more years"" and waved ""Keep America Great!"" signs. At one point, unprompted, the crowd chanted ""I want nothing -- no quid pro quo"" as Mr. Trump recalled his conversation with Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union.The event was billed as a ""homecoming rally"" for Mr. Trump, a lifelong New Yorker who recently changed his residency to Palm Beach, Fla. (At least a couple of Floridians in attendance said that Mr. Trump's announcement caught them off guard: Between his Doral golf club outside Miami and Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, they assumed he was already a Floridian.)Ahead of his customary Thanksgiving week at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump reserved multiple nods for his new home and the weight it will bear on his push to win re-election. He highlighted efforts by his administration and its Republican allies in Florida to repair military bases devastated by hurricanes and to protect the state's beaches from an infestation of poisonous algae known as red tide. He also showered the state's Republicans with praise. (Introducing Gov. Ron DeSantis, Mr. Trump observed that ""I always thought Ron was a little bit heavy,"" but after seeing Mr. DeSantis shirtless, decided that ""this guy is strong."" The governor's office clarified that Mr. Trump had seen Mr. DeSantis jacketless, not shirtless.)The president also vowed to ""oppose the horrors of socialism in America,"" a message intended to resonate in a community built in part by those who fled communist governments in Latin America and one that brought the crowd to its feet.During the nearly 90-minute speech, Mr. Trump frequently toggled between promoting his administration's accomplishments and airing his grievances with his Washington adversaries. Tossing a few ""Make America Great Again"" hats into the crowd at the beginning of the rally, he treated the attendees as confidants. Mr. Trump wrapped them into the ""fight to take our country back"" and waxed nostalgic about his 2016 victory, his inaugural parade and the days when the news media did not scrutinize his every move.""Can I be honest, in front of these fakers back there?"" Mr. Trump asked the crowd, which responded with a variety of gestures in the direction of the media pen. He painted a world in which he and the audience united once more in 2020 to fight back against a number of adversaries, including those who wanted to stop saying ""Happy Thanksgiving."" (It was unclear who those people were and what they wanted to say instead.)Even as he reminisced about his victories over the Bush and Clinton dynasties, he would pivot midthought to lament the distortion of his ""perfect phone call"" with Ukraine's president and the ""very sick and corrupt people"" investigating his administration. But, he assured the crowd, they would ultimately be unsuccessful.""A lot of bad things are happening to them -- you see what's happening in the polls?"" he said.Ultimately, Mr. Trump returned to what was ostensibly his core reason for being in Florida: cajoling the cheering crowd into turning out to vote next November and solidifying enough Republican support in the state's electorate to earn a second term.""We have the greatest base in the history of politics,"" he told the crowd. ""You went to great colleges, you people are successful as hell, you're better looking.""""If they're elite,"" he added, ""then we're the superelite.""Patricia Mazzei contributed reporting from Miami, and Maggie Haberman from New York.Patricia Mazzei contributed reporting from Miami, and Maggie Haberman from New York.Photograph""We have the greatest base in the history of politics,"" President Trump said on Tuesday in Sunrise, Fla., at his ""homecoming"" rally.

| Jump to first hitNational polls have him firmly behind Joe Biden across the country, and questions remain over Mr. Buttigieg's ability to create a diverse coalition. But in Iowa, he's on the rise.DECORAH, Iowa -- Ask almost any Iowa Democrat, and they'll tell you: Pete Buttigieg is smart.He speaks five languages, went to Harvard University and plays the piano, Martha Ludeking, 63, recited, as she watched the presidential candidate take a picture with a fellow Iowan. Lori Lechtenberg, 59, said, ""There's just something about him -- he's intelligent."" When an audience member asked about conditions in Gaza during a campaign stop in Mason City, Mr. Buttigieg began responding in Arabic. The overwhelmingly white audience, largely unaware of what he said, broke into raucous applause.""He's a veteran. He's a Rhodes scholar. He's everything,"" said Bret Van Ausdall, 37. He saw Mr. Buttigieg on Sunday at the fourth stop on his bus tour, a 72-hour whirlwind that prioritized small Iowa counties that had drifted from Democrats in recent elections. ""The Ph.D. ratio in this town is insane. We're science-based. We're logical people. And he speaks to that.""Throughout the summer months, Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., surpassed expectations in fund-raising and national polling, but his success was still dismissed as a temporary blip. He was seen as a flavor of the month in a historically large Democratic field who would eventually be eclipsed by more traditionally qualified candidates -- senators, governors, a former vice president.This weekend, however, Mr. Buttigieg made clear that what was once an upstart campaign could grow into a juggernaut in the all-important Iowa caucuses, just three months away.Mr. Buttigieg's critics say he is offering voters feel-good platitudes without a proven track record of electoral success. But his supporters say his vision, and his identity as an openly gay candidate, make him an inherently transformative figure.He has successfully built a sustainable ground game throughout the state, generating buzz among voters and turning out crowds of several hundred people in towns of just a few thousand. For growing numbers of likely caucusgoers, he is emerging as the moderate front-runner in the race, ahead of even former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. And he is clearly worrying some of his top rivals in the state, like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has recently started taking implicit shots at Mr. Buttigieg by needling candidates who have teams of consultants and centrist ideas.National polls still have Mr. Buttigieg firmly behind Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and questions remain over Mr. Buttigieg's ability to cobble together a coalition diverse enough to win the Democratic primary. But the goal of the bus tour, timed to take place after the same Iowa dinner that famously helped create Barack Obama's presidential mojo in 2007, was to project Mr. Buttigieg as the closest analogue to Mr. Obama currently in the race.""The idea of hope may have gone out of style a little bit, but when I look at you, I see it is not out of style,"" Mr. Buttigieg said in Des Moines. ""Are you ready to leave no question about who has the momentum of Iowa right now?""He has shot up in the polls in Iowa recently and had a one-point edge over Mr. Biden in a recent New York Times/Siena College poll of Iowa voters, within the survey's margin of error of plus or minus 4.7 percentage points. Ms. Warren held a slight lead in the poll, while Mr. Sanders came in second, just ahead of Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Biden.On Friday, Mr. Buttigieg's supporters filled a quarter of Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines at the Iowa Democratic Party's annual Liberty and Justice Dinner -- a show of organizing force greater than any other candidate's. He held a rally for thousands near the arena before the dinner.In an open press setting, Mr. Buttigieg can flaunt the same political athleticism that is attracting voters in Iowa and was a trademark of Mr. Obama's, fielding rapid-fire questions from reporters that touch on everything from his previous work in management consulting to his current reading list.To distinguish himself from his rivals, and Ms. Warren's promises of fighting for ""big, structural change"" in particular, Mr. Buttigieg has taken up an increasingly Obama-esque message of unity and civility.He asks voters to call relatives with different political beliefs, and to talk about things other than politics. He told voters in a county that flipped from supporting Mr. Obama to Donald Trump that political preferences did not define their morality, and he said he welcomed ""Republicans of conscience"" to join his campaign.""I just don't think there's good and bad people,"" Mr. Buttigieg said later, speaking on the bus. ""When you vote for this president, particularly when you vote for him a second time, you are at best tolerating bad things and at worst having very bad things drawn out of you. But I don't think that's the same as thinking the world is divided into people who are good and people who are bad.""With this message, and the organization he has now built in Iowa, Mr. Buttigieg is becoming an interesting test case for the post-Obama Democratic Party. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders pitch a sharp break from the past, and a willingness to ideologically upend the establishment in ways the party has historically resisted. Mr. Biden seeks to offer a steady hand in chaotic political times. But Mr. Buttigieg uniquely plays to the one thing the Democratic electorate has always enjoyed: falling in love with a new political face promising national unity and compromise.But swapping out the identities and résumés of the two men -- not a black, straight senator from Illinois but a gay, white mayor from Indiana -- can change the electoral prospects. For Mr. Obama, who was already well-liked in black communities, the path to the Democratic nomination was unlocked in Iowa, helping him centralize black support in South Carolina and in the southern Democratic electorate en route to the nomination. Black support has been the biggest question mark surrounding Mr. Buttigieg's rise.A recent Monmouth University poll of likely Democratic primary voters in South Carolina, the early-voting state where the black electorate makes up more than 60 percent of the Democratic vote, found Mr. Buttigieg at 3 percent overall, with just 1 percent support from black respondents. Previous polls have found him at an anemic 0 percent among black voters.Even more, high-profile missteps and an initial campaign strategy that relied on heavy exposure to white media and donors helped create a reputation that Mr. Buttigieg's campaign had a blind spot for black community politics. In these communities, where government distrust has been earned over years of disenfranchisement, elite signals such as a Harvard education and a Rhodes scholarship matter less than building relationships with key gatekeepers and validators.Over the weekend, Julián Castro, the former housing secretary and one of Mr. Buttigieg's 2020 rivals, criticized his ""track record"" with black voters. On Monday, Mr. Buttigieg's senior communications adviser, Lis Smith, forcefully accused Mr. Buttigieg's critics of being biased themselves.A police killing in South Bend exposed racial tension in Mr. Buttigieg's hometown, and black residents have complained of persistent racial inequality during his tenure as mayor. Mr. Buttigieg's campaign backtracked last month after scheduling a fund-raiser with a lawyer in Chicago who had tried to block the release of footage of the 2014 killing of Laquan McDonald, a black teenager, by a white police officer.Earlier in his campaign, when Mr. Buttigieg met with members of the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington this summer, he flunked a key test among the senior group of lawmakers. When at least three representatives asked why he did not have black supporters from South Bend validating him on the trail, Mr. Buttigieg told them he did not know such signaling was important.""It was pandering and disingenuous,"" said Representative Marcia Fudge of Ohio, who has since endorsed Senator Kamala Harris of California.In the months since, as Mr. Buttigieg has professionalized his once bare-bones operation, he has focused on adding staff that can help him better navigate the black political class.Brandon Neal, a senior adviser who once worked at the N.A.A.C.P., has helped broker discussions between Mr. Buttigieg and elder civil rights statesmen like Representative John Lewis of Georgia and Harry Belafonte. Beltway operatives like Donna Brazile and Leah Daughtry, both influential figures at the Democratic National Committee, have been conduits who have helped him grow his relationships with the black political class in Washington.There have been some signs of progress. Mr. Buttigieg was well-received at the recent Congressional Black Caucus Foundation dinner, where he sat at the table of a fellow Midwestern legislator, Representative Robin Kelly of Illinois. Lamell McMorris, a longtime black political consultant with experience at civil rights organizations such as the N.A.A.C.P. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, will soon join the campaign as a surrogate.Mr. Buttigieg has repeatedly said he believes that as black Democratic voters get to know him, he will win their support.""I think the way to win black voters, or any voters, is to deserve to win,"" Mr. Buttigieg said in Iowa multiple times.Still, even some Iowa supporters wondered if he was developing a reputation as a candidate for white elites. One white audience member in Mason City asked Mr. Buttigieg what his plan was for winning over black voters, because that would determine his post-Iowa electoral prospects. Another, in Decorah, said his reliance on money from big donors, who skew overwhelmingly white, was pushing her toward candidates such as Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, who had sworn off such funds.""Pete screwed up on that one,"" said Janet Alexander, 73. ""Because that stuff is important. It shows who you're listening to.""On the bus tour, Mr. Buttigieg sidestepped a question about why largely white states such as Iowa and New Hampshire get to caucus and vote first.He smiled and pivoted, saying the four early states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada -- give a good distribution of the Democratic electorate.Mr. Buttigieg left out another truth: The whitest ones are, to this point, making his candidacy tick.PhotographPete Buttigieg drew an enthusiastic crowd at a town hall-style event Sunday in Mason City, Iowa.; Backers say Mr. Buttigieg's political vision marks him out as a potentially transformative candidate.

| Jump to first hitWASHINGTON -- A career State Department official told impeachment investigators this week that he raised concerns with a senior White House official in 2015 about the son of then-Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. holding a position on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.But the warning from George P. Kent, then a State Department officer stationed in Kiev, was not acted on, according to two people familiar with Mr. Kent's testimony. Mr. Kent, now of the State Department's Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, said he told the official that Hunter Biden's position could look like a conflict of interest, given his father's role, and would complicate American efforts to encourage Ukraine to clean up corruption.The White House official told Mr. Kent that the elder Mr. Biden did not have the ""bandwidth"" to address the concerns while his older son, Beau, was undergoing cancer treatment, according to the people, who were not authorized to discuss the private deposition.President Trump on Friday latched onto the rare bit of good news for him coming out of the House's impeachment inquiry. Mr. Kent had also given Democrats plenty of fodder to drive their inquiry forward, but the emergence of any information that could tarnish the Bidens was welcome at the White House, even if White House officials have declared the inquiry illegitimate.""He excoriated the Obama administration and Joe Biden and Joe Biden's son, saying that he has tremendous problems, tremendous problems, with Joe Biden's son and the Ukraine,"" Mr. Trump said of Mr. Kent, citing news reports. He added, ""It's been a big deal.""Mr. Kent's remarks about the Bidens were first reported by The Washington Post. Mr. Kent also voiced concerns about the Trump administration's handling of the United States' relationship with Ukraine, testifying that he and other career officials were all but cut out of decisions regarding the country after a May meeting at the White House.Andrew Wright and Barry Hartman, lawyers for Mr. Kent, declined to discuss the details of his testimony but cautioned against selectively picking out ""elements of his testimony"" that ""might not give the full picture.""Hunter Biden's work for the Ukrainian firm Burisma Holdings, and an unsubstantiated allegation that his father took official action as vice president to protect the firm from a Ukrainian prosecutor, lie at the center of the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Trump and his private lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, both pressured Ukraine's leaders to investigate the Bidens, and House lawmakers are examining whether the White House withheld around $400 million in military aid to Ukraine to pressure Kiev to conduct the investigation of the Bidens or other matters of interest to the president.Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr. Biden's presidential campaign, said Mr. Biden stood by his record as vice president. Mr. Biden has denied he took any improper actions in connection to his son's work.""On Joe Biden's watch, the U.S. made eradicating corruption a centerpiece of our policies toward Ukraine, including achieving the removal of an inept prosecutor who shielded wrongdoers from accountability,"" he said.It might be useful to Mr. Trump to be able to say his concerns about Hunter Biden's work were shared by State Department officials during the Obama administration. But pressing that point holds risks.On Friday, Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, expressed unease that the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, had, during a televised White House briefing Thursday, indicated a link between the withholding of military assistance and the demand for another investigation related to the Democrats. Before reversing himself, Mr. Mulvaney said that Mr. Trump had withheld the funds in part until Ukraine began an investigation into an unsubstantiated theory that Ukraine, rather than Russia, had interfered in the 2016 presidential election.Mr. Kinzinger told CNN he was not sure what Mr. Mulvaney was saying the president wanted Ukraine to investigate when he told reporters the aid was withheld pending the investigation. But, he said, if it had anything to do with the Bidens, that would be serious, ""because it would be, if it's true, taxpayer-funded aid and policy for political reasons, which is totally wrong.""This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.Word count: 695Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hitMr. Biden in recent days has been more forceful in defending his family and denouncing the president. Some voters and Democratic officials think he should do more.WESTERVILLE, Ohio -- In the last few days, Joseph R. Biden Jr. has unveiled a new government ethics plan and vowed that his family members would do no business overseas during a Biden presidency. His son, Hunter Biden, said he would step down from his role with a Chinese investment firm, and sat for his first television interview of the campaign. And in Iowa, the elder Mr. Biden delivered a fist-pounding diatribe against President Trump, casting him as the embodiment of public corruption.Altogether, it has added up to the most assertive attempt by Mr. Biden and his camp to extinguish questions about his son's business activities since Mr. Trump began raising them as a campaign issue, often in false or exaggerated terms.What remains to be seen is whether Mr. Biden can put those issues to rest on a far bigger stage -- at the CNN/New York Times Democratic primary debate in central Ohio on Tuesday night.As fierce as Mr. Biden's efforts have been since the start of the weekend, he has in some ways raised as many questions as he has answered. If his family intends to shun foreign business in the event that he becomes president -- as Hunter Biden said he would on Sunday -- voters may wonder why they didn't do it far sooner, when Mr. Biden was conducting foreign diplomacy as vice president.Perhaps most of all, anxious Democratic leaders are looking to the former vice president for a sign on the debate stage that all of this is not coming too late in this campaign to make a difference -- to quash the undercurrent of doubt among some Democratic strategists, activists, donors and voters that Mr. Biden is really ready for a general-election fight against a president prepared to scorch and smear his way to a second term.""I'm a little worried about how Joe's going to do if he were to get on a debate stage with the president, a little worried he'd be able to get him rattled,"" said Tom Courtney, the co-chairman of the Des Moines County Democrats in Iowa, a state where the Biden campaign has made substantial investments. ""I would like to see him quit getting bogged down in little things. This guy has got way more experience than all the other candidates up there. He needs to take charge and show that.""Mr. Biden is hardly the only candidate who faces high stakes in Tuesday's debate. Senator Bernie Sanders, 78, the oldest candidate in the race, suffered a heart attack. He now faces significant questions about his age and stamina at a moment when he consistently trails Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren in many national polls. Ms. Warren, a new front-runner, is all but certain to confront more scrutiny from other candidates onstage, which would put to the test her ability to weather sharper criticism in the national spotlight.But no one among the 12 candidates in the debate has faced as many challenges as Mr. Biden -- some of them self-inflicted, and some created by a president in full attack mode, seizing on Hunter Biden's overseas business dealings in an attempt to tarnish the former vice president. After responding tentatively at first, Mr. Biden has steadily increased his counterattacks against Mr. Trump.At a news conference in Altoona, Iowa, on Sunday, Mr. Biden ferociously defended his family, tore into ""lying President"" Trump and issued several oblique swipes at members of the Trump family, who have their own records of overseas business dealings.Mr. Biden himself has pledged to be more assertive in Tuesday's debate, acknowledging at a fund-raiser last week that ""I've got to be more aggressive"" and adding, ""I'm not complaining, I'm a big boy.""""When he says, 'I'm going to be more forceful and active on the stage,' I think he means he's not going to let people misrepresent his record, and in particular, he's going to take it to Trump because I think he's had enough,"" said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware and a Biden ally.Mr. Biden enters the debate having endured perhaps the worst month of his candidacy, a period defined by his slow and halting pushback against Mr. Trump -- a hesitancy some early-state Democratic voters have noticed -- and a time-consuming scramble for campaign donations at the end of a less than commanding fund-raising quarter. Mr. Biden is more reliant on high-dollar fund-raisers than his leading rivals, a requirement that took him largely out of public view for days, just as Mr. Trump was amplifying his false claims about Hunter Biden's business dealings overseas.Steve Snyder, a college professor from Des Moines, expressed respect for Mr. Biden as he waited for Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., to address a shivering crowd gathered outside a Des Moines high school on Saturday night. But, noting the pace of the president's broadsides against Mr. Biden, he said that the Biden campaign appeared to be ""slow-footing"" their response, even as he acknowledged the challenges of responding to Mr. Trump.""This isn't a typical campaign,"" said Mr. Snyder, who said he is leaning toward supporting Ms. Warren. ""This is information warfare. They're just not responding quick enough.""Asked to address concerns that Mr. Biden's message was getting drowned out, a view which was shared by some other Iowa voters, Mr. Biden's campaign spokesman, T.J. Ducklo, said in a statement Sunday that Mr. Biden ""will continue punching back hard against Donald Trump's pathetic and increasingly unhinged behavior, while also keeping the focus on issues where Trump has failed middle class families, like rising health care costs and the urgent climate crisis.""He also cited Mr. Biden's standing in recent polls, arguing that ""these attacks aren't working with Democratic voters."" Mr. Biden's numbers have generally remained steady at the national level since the controversy over Ukraine broke open last month.Yet Mr. Biden, who months ago held a commanding edge over his rivals, has nearly lost his lead in primary polls, having dipped well below 30 percent in The New York Times national polling average. He is barely ahead of Ms. Warren in that ranking, which gauges national support, and he is tied with her, or trailing, in three of the four early-voting states. While Mr. Biden maintains a powerful bloc of support in the race, built on the loyalty of African-American voters and moderate whites, that coalition has been shrinking rather than growing -- a trend he must reverse if he is to become the nominee.Mr. Biden raised $15.2 million in the third quarter, a sturdy sum but far less than what Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren collected. He also trails Mr. Buttigieg, who has become a cause célèbre for many party donors.And Mr. Biden has declined to reveal how much money he had in the bank at the end of September, raising concerns among his supporters that he may not have the cash reserves required to defend his dwindling lead. He is legally required to disclose that figure by the end of Tuesday, a coincidence that makes the evening of the debate a moment of truth for his campaign in more ways than one.The debate, his allies acknowledge, is perhaps his best chance to reassure his supporters and regain some momentum in the race. That would likely require a feat Mr. Biden has not accomplished so far in this race: a thoroughly forceful debate performance, free of missteps or flustered responses to predictable criticism from his Democratic opponents.""He needs to figure out how he wants to handle all this Trump noise,"" said Jeff Link, a veteran Iowa Democratic strategist. ""He's got to find a way to basically say to the audience, 'There's only one guy that Trump is worried about and is attacking, and let me tell you what I'm going to do about it.""'PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. denounced what he called a ""lying President"" Trump on Sunday in Altoona, Iowa.

| Jump to first hitBOSSIER CITY, La. -- President Trump urged Louisiana voters on Thursday to ""send a message to the corrupt Democrats in Washington"" by electing to governor the Republican nominee, Eddie Rispone, directly linking the impeachment inquiry to a state election that will test his clout in the Deep South.

Addressing supporters at his second rally in two weeks in heavily Republican north Louisiana, and his first since Democrats began public impeachment hearings, Mr. Trump dutifully read from his prepared text in an effort to rouse conservatives ahead of Saturday's election.

""You will deliver a powerful rebuke to the socialists trying to demolish our democracy,"" he told an arena full of enthusiasts here along the Red River.

But he also let slip his more personal interest in the Louisiana election, where Gov. John Bel Edwards is seeking re-election, by recalling negative headlines he had received this month in another race. Gov. Matt Bevin of Kentucky, a Republican, lost his re-election a day after Mr. Trump rallied supporters in the state.

""You got to give me a big win, please, O.K.,"" the president pleaded with his supporters.
Mr. Trump was hoping to break open a deadlocked race between Mr. Rispone and Mr. Edwards, a moderate Democrat who has carefully avoided criticizing the president in a state where he remains fairly popular.With House Democrats accelerating their investigation into Mr. Trump's conduct with Ukraine, the White House is eager to show that his core supporters remain loyal and that he can deliver a victory in a state he carried by 20 points.

Calling Democrats ""crazed lunatics,"" he repeatedly insisted he did nothing wrong in his efforts to urge Ukranians to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. And, by way of professing his innocence, he noted that he had dethroned the Bush, Clinton and Obama ""dynasties"" in 2016 and would hardly require foreign interference to win a re-election.

""We need help to beat Sleepy Joe Biden? I don't think so,"" Mr. Trump said.

Mr. Trump also claimed with no evidence that congressional Republicans find the impeachment proceedings politically beneficial and have urged him to ""keep this sucker going for a while.""

But the president made clear he was not much enjoying his status as the fourth American president to face impeachment and in a rare moment of reflection, he admitted that the process was ""very hard on my family.""

""What a life I lead,"" he said. ""You think this is fun, don't you.""

Mr. Trump's introspection was fleeting, however, and he soon returned to his familiar repertoire of hits, belittling his Democratic antagonists on Capitol Hill and at one point venturing that Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, did not have what it takes to suit up for Louisiana State University's top-ranked football team.

As for Mr. Biden, the president said he would gladly face off with him in the general election but warned the crowd that they would witness ""the lowest ratings in the history of debates"" because the Democratic front-runner ""is a very sleepy person.""

The president delivered the soundbyte-ready lines he came armed with against Mr. Edwards, calling the pro-gun rights and anti-abortion rights Democrat a tool of Washington liberals.""A vote for John Bel Edwards is a vote for radical leftists,"" Mr. Trump said.

At another point, he offered an even more demagogic line in a part of Louisiana that bears the scars of an ugly racial history.""John Bel Edwards supports illegal aliens, not American citizens,"" the president said. He eventually broke character -- ""that was a long harangue,"" he observed of his own prepared remarks -- and turned to other interests, such as trumpeting the Oxford University credentials of Senator John Neely Kennedy of Louisiana to a decidedly working-class audience.

Mr. Trump brought an array of Louisiana Republicans to the stage, including Mr. Rispone, who echoed the president on how this election could ""send a message.""What nobody said explicitly was that the president was under more pressure to deliver after the Kentucky race. Mr. Bevin conceded defeat Thursday as a recanvass of the state's votes made clear that Andy Beshear, the attorney general, won.Mr. Trump's task here is not much easier. Mr. Edwards is relatively popular and Mr. Rispone, a business executive and donor, is a first-time candidate who is not well known in the state.But with two appearances in the closing weeks of the race, the president has put his political capital on the line for Mr. Rispone.And the Republican nominee here has done his part to increase the stakes for the White House, linking himself to Mr. Trump at every turn. Mr. Rispone began the race with an ad depicting the ""Trump"" bumper sticker he placed on his pickup truck. He has also echoed the president's outsider appeals and pet issue, arguing that a state government needs a businessman while assailing Mr. Edwards over immigration.The governor, while refusing to criticize Mr. Trump, has portrayed Mr. Rispone as one who is grasping the president's coattails and attempting to ""nationalize this race.""""He cannot win this race based on Louisiana issues because he hasn't demonstrated any knowledge about how state government works,"" Mr. Edwards told supporters in nearby Shreveport on Thursday afternoon. ""He doesn't have any vision for the state of Louisiana.""A West Point graduate and former Army Ranger, Mr. Edwards has expanded Medicaid, raised teachers' pay and also raised some taxes in an effort to balance the state's budget.This is the president's third visit to the state in just over a month. He appeared last month in Lake Charles, La., as part of an effort to drive up Republican turnout in Louisiana's all-party primary. Mr. Rispone narrowly edged out Representative Ralph Abraham, a Republican, to claim a spot in the runoff against Mr. Edwards and not all the wounds have healed from the Rispone-Abraham contest.That is why the president has returned to the same part of the state -- it is Mr. Abraham's home base -- in an effort to rally Republicans in what is the last election of 2019. Bringing Mr. Abraham to the stage, Mr. Trump acknowledged their bitter primary, calling it ""nasty."" But the president offered little balm, instead reminding Mr. Abraham that Mr. Rispone had self-financed his own victory, and noting that Mr. Abraham had ""a little less money to spend than Eddie.""PhotographPresident Trump with Eddie Rispone, the Republican nominee for Louisiana governor, on Thursday.

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump's personal lawyer has been in Budapest and Kyiv this week to talk with former Ukrainian prosecutors for a documentary series intended to debunk the impeachment case.WASHINGTON -- Even as Democrats intensified their scrutiny this week of Rudolph W. Giuliani's role in the pressure campaign against the Ukrainian government that is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, Mr. Giuliani has been in Europe continuing his efforts to shift the focus to purported wrongdoing by President Trump's political rivals.Mr. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, met in Budapest on Tuesday with a former Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, who has become a key figure in the impeachment inquiry. He then traveled to Kyiv on Wednesday seeking to meet with other former Ukrainian prosecutors whose claims have been embraced by Republicans, including Viktor Shokin and Kostiantyn H. Kulyk, according to people familiar with the effort.The former prosecutors, who have faced allegations of corruption, all played some role in promoting claims about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a former United States ambassador to Ukraine and Ukrainians who disseminated damaging information about Mr. Trump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, in 2016.Those claims -- some baseless and others with key disputed elements -- have been the foundations of the effort by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani to pressure the Ukrainian government to commit itself to investigations that would benefit Mr. Trump heading into his re-election campaign. That effort in turn has led to the impeachment proceedings in the House against the president.Mr. Giuliani is using the trip, which has not been previously reported, to help prepare more episodes of a documentary series for a conservative television outlet promoting his pro-Trump, anti-impeachment narrative. His latest moves to advance the theories propounded by the prosecutors amount to an audacious effort to give the president's supporters new material to undercut the House impeachment proceedings and an eventual Senate trial.It was Mr. Giuliani's earlier interactions with some of the same Ukrainian characters that set the stage for the impeachment inquiry in the first place, and also led to an investigation by federal prosecutors into whether Mr. Giuliani violated federal lobbying laws.Mr. Giuliani's trip has generated concern in some quarters of the State Department, coming amid scrutiny of his work with American diplomats earlier this year on the pressure campaign. His trip to Budapest and Kyiv suggests that he is unbowed by the intense scrutiny that has enveloped him and his associates, including revelations from the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday of frequent calls from Mr. Giuliani to the White House and other figures in the pressure campaign at key moments this year.The European trip was organized around the filming of a multipart television series featuring Mr. Giuliani that is being produced and aired by a conservative cable channel, One America News, or OAN.The series, the first two installments of which have already aired, is being promoted as a Republican alternative to the impeachment hearings, including Ukrainian ""witnesses"" whom House Democrats running the inquiry declined to call. Some of the Ukrainians interviewed by Mr. Giuliani were sworn in on camera to ""testify under oath"" in a manner that the network claims ""debunks the impeachment hoax.""Mr. Giuliani was joined in Budapest by an OAN crew, including the reporter hosting the series, Chanel Rion, who conducted an interview in the Hungarian capital with Mr. Lutsenko, according to someone familiar with the interview.Earlier this year, Mr. Lutsenko played a formative role in what became Mr. Trump's pressure campaign, meeting with Mr. Giuliani in New York, where he made claims about a gas company that paid Mr. Biden's son as a board member and the dissemination of a secret ledger listing slush payments from a Russia-aligned Ukrainian political party earmarked to Mr. Manafort and others. When The New York Times revealed the payments earmarked to Mr. Manafort in August 2016, it forced him to resign under pressure from the Trump campaign.Mr. Lutsenko, whom Mr. Giuliani considered representing as a client, is facing allegations in Ukraine of abuse of power during his years as a prosecutor and was characterized by some American officials in the impeachment inquiry as untrustworthy. But his office moved to pursue investigations sought by Mr. Trump, and he was praised by the president as a ""very good prosecutor"" during a July 25 phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.Mr. Lutsenko discussed some of the subjects into which Mr. Trump sought investigations during his interview on Tuesday with Ms. Rion, said the person familiar with the interview.Also joining Mr. Giuliani and the OAN crew in Budapest were two former Ukrainian officials who have been supportive of Mr. Trump, Andrii Telizhenko and Andrii V. Artemenko.The pair, along with a third former Ukrainian official, Mykhaylo Okhendovsky, recorded interviews at OAN's studios in Washington late last month with Ms. Rion and Mr. Giuliani for an episode of the series that aired on Tuesday night.The three Ukrainians questioned the Democrats' case for impeachment during the episode. And they asserted that Mr. Trump had ample reason to ask Mr. Zelensky during their July 25 phone call to investigate the Bidens and whether Ukrainians acted improperly to damage Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign.The July 25 call helped trigger a whistle-blower complaint about the pressure wielded by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani against Mr. Zelensky, and the whistle-blower complaint incited the impeachment inquiry into whether Mr. Trump abused his power for political gain.In the OAN episode broadcast on Tuesday, Mr. Telizhenko reiterated his claims that, while working in the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington in 2016, he was instructed to help a Democratic operative gather incriminating information about Mr. Manafort. The Ukrainian Embassy has denied his account.Mr. Artemenko, a former member of Parliament, and Mr. Okhendovsky, the former chairman of Ukraine's Central Election Commission, both called into question the authenticity of the ledger listing payments to Mr. Manafort.Ms. Rion falsely claimed on air that the Democratic operative connected to the Ukrainian Embassy, who has become a frequent target of House Republicans, provided the ledger to The Times. She declared that her interviews with Mr. Telizhenko, Mr. Artemenko and Mr. Okhendovsky ""pulls the rug out from under"" Democrats' ""central premise that Trump was wrong to ask about Joe Biden and the Democrat party's starring role in Ukrainian corruption.""Ms. Rion, Mr. Telizhenko, Mr. Artemenko and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Giuliani rejected any notion that it was audacious or risky for him to continue pursuing the Ukrainian mission, given the scrutiny of him by impeachment investigators and federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, or S.D.N.Y.""If S.D.N.Y. leaks and Democrats' threats stopped me, then I should find a new profession,"" he wrote in a text message on Wednesday.Asked about his interview with Mr. Lutsenko and efforts to interview other Ukrainian prosecutors, he responded that ""like a good lawyer, I am gathering evidence to defend my client against the false charges being leveled against him"" by the news media and Democrats.He accused Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, which conducted impeachment hearings last month, of preventing testimony that could help Mr. Trump. ""I am hoping that the evidence concealed by Schiff will be available to the public as they evaluate his outrageous, unconstitutional behavior.""He did not respond to a question about whether he briefed Mr. Trump on his trip or his involvement in the OAN series, but he has said that he keeps Mr. Trump apprised of his efforts related to Ukraine.In a news release Tuesday, OAN indicated that the third installment of its series with Mr. Giuliani was ""currently in the works with OAN investigative staff outside the United States conducting key interviews at undisclosed safe houses."" It said the network would release additional details ""upon return of OAN staff to U.S. soil.""In Budapest, Mr. Giuliani had dinner on Tuesday night at the residence of the United States ambassador to Hungary, David B. Cornstein, a longtime friend and associate of both Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani.A businessman who made a fortune operating jewelry counters inside department stores and worked in Mr. Giuliani's New York mayoral administration, Mr. Cornstein has courted Viktor Orban, Hungary's authoritarian prime minister, who in turn has provided fodder for Mr. Trump's critical view of Ukraine.A spokesman for the American Embassy in Budapest issued a statement describing the Tuesday night get-together as ""a private dinner"" hosted by the ambassador ""with his longtime friend,"" Mr. Giuliani, and Mr. Giuliani's assistant. ""No one else was present at the dinner.""A reporter who showed up outside the ambassador's residence during the dinner was turned away by a security guard.Some State Department officials said they were tracking Mr. Giuliani's continued efforts to engage the Ukrainians with concern. One department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a politically sensitive topic, called it ""shocking"" that, in the face of scrutiny of his prior efforts related to Ukraine, Mr. Giuliani was traveling internationally in continued pursuit of information from Ukrainians.One of the former prosecutors with whom Mr. Giuliani is seeking to meet in Kyiv is Mr. Shokin, who claims his ouster was forced by Mr. Biden to prevent investigations into the gas company paying Mr. Biden's son Hunter Biden. Allies of the oligarch who owns the gas company say they welcomed Mr. Shokin's firing, but not because he was actively investigating the company or the oligarch. Rather, they say, he was using the threat of prosecution to try to solicit bribes.Another prosecutor with whom Mr. Giuliani was seeking to meet, Mr. Kulyk, had compiled a seven-page dossier in English accusing Hunter Biden of corruption, and had taken steps to pursue an investigation into Burisma Holdings, the gas company on whose board Hunter Biden served. Mr. Kulyk was fired recently by Mr. Zelensky's new top prosecutor as part of an anti-corruption initiative.OAN's crew hopes to interview the former prosecutors as well, Ms. Rion suggested during the first episode of the series, which aired late last month.Kenneth P.

| Jump to first hitDemocrats have narrowed their focus to two articles of impeachment against President Trump, expected to be unveiled on Tuesday, after lawyers labeled his conduct a ""clear and present danger"" to fair elections and national security.WASHINGTON -- House Democrats signaled that they would unveil articles of impeachment on Tuesday morning that charge President Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for conduct they called a ""clear and present danger"" to the 2020 election and national security.The House Judiciary Committee was expected to work through the night on Monday readying the charges, according to multiple senior officials and lawmakers.They cautioned that plans were not final, but several officials said they were now focused on two charges: that Mr. Trump violated his oath of office by putting his political concerns over the national interest and that he stonewalled congressional attempts to investigate. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss the decision before it was ready.""What happened with Ukraine -- it's not something we can close our eyes to,"" Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said as he emerged Monday night from a meeting with Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Mr. Engel and four other Democratic committee leaders scheduled a 9 a.m. news conference for Tuesday in a stately Capitol reception room to lay out their plans.Mr. Engel spoke an hour after the conclusion of a contentious Judiciary Committee hearing where Democratic lawyers testified that the evidence against Mr. Trump was overwhelming and demanded urgent action.Summarizing the findings of a two-month investigation by the Intelligence Committee, they asserted that the president had abused his office by soliciting re-election help from Ukraine, and then tried to conceal his actions from Congress.""President Trump's persistent and continuing effort to coerce a foreign country to help him cheat to win an election is a clear and present danger to our free and fair elections and to our national security,"" Daniel S. Goldman, the Intelligence Committee lawyer who led the Ukraine inquiry, testified as he presented the evidence gathered against the president.The presentations by Mr. Goldman and a Democratic lawyer for the Judiciary Committee will form the basis for a debate in the committee, expected to begin as soon as Wednesday, over whether to recommend the House adopt the articles of impeachment charging a president with high crimes and misdemeanors for only the third time in American history.Even as the hearing forecast the impeachment articles Democrats planned to lodge against Mr. Trump, it also offered hints about the kinds of charges that Democrats might avoid.Democrats, for instance, did not use the term bribery, an offense explicitly mentioned in the Constitution as impeachable and one that leaders have used in the past to describe the president's conduct. And they did not discuss instances of potential obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump when he tried to thwart the special counsel's investigation of possible links between his campaign and Russian election interference.Instead, they used slickly excerpted video clips of testimony from senior diplomats and White House officials to accuse Mr. Trump of pressuring President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to announce investigations of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and an unsupported claim that Democrats conspired with Ukraine to interfere in the 2016 election. At the same time, they said, the president withheld as leverage a White House meeting and nearly $400 million in security assistance the country needed to hold off Russian aggression.""This is a big deal,"" said Barry H. Berke, the counsel for Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, appealing to the deeply divided panel of lawmakers sitting before him. ""President Trump did what a president of our nation is not allowed to do.""The hearing, which unfolded over nine hours in the stately House Ways and Means Committee Room near the Capitol, featured bitter rounds of partisan sparring between Democrats and Republicans and testy cross-examinations of lawyers from both parties. Republicans arrived primed to challenge the Democrats' case and condemn the process they have used to assemble it. They repeatedly interrupted the Democrats' public presentation, and their own counsel used two separate addresses to try to dismantle it.""Very simply, the evidence in the Democrats' impeachment inquiry does not support the Democrats' conclusion that President Trump abused his power for his own personal, political benefit,"" said Stephen R. Castor, a lawyer representing Republicans on both the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees.Mr. Castor said there was ""simply no clear evidence"" that Mr. Trump had ""malicious intent in withholding a meeting or security assistance,"" and ample evidence that the president had legitimate concerns about corruption in Ukraine. And he accused Democrats of having gone ""searching for a set of facts on which to impeach the president,"" essentially manufacturing a scandal where there was none.The White House once again refused to participate in the day's proceedings, despite appeals by Democrats to come to the table before it was too late. Mr. Trump and his allies, though, have now publicly turned their attention toward a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, where they believe they will have an easier time mounting a defense.But that did not stop Mr. Trump himself from participating -- at least via social media.After posting or reposting nearly 100 messages on Twitter on Sunday, most of them complaining about the impeachment effort and assailing Democrats, the president fired off more on Monday as the hearing progressed.""The Do Nothing Democrats are a disgrace!"" Mr. Trump tweeted.For now, Democrats have elected to press ahead without the White House's cooperation. The Judiciary Committee is likely to debate and vote on articles of impeachment by week's end, likely along party lines, recommending their adoption by the full House. That would set up a vote before Christmas to impeach Mr. Trump, and a Senate trial early in the new year.During the Judiciary Committee debate, individual lawmakers can propose changes to the articles leaders will unveil on Tuesday as well as additional articles, though they would be subject to a vote of the full committee.As the impeachment inquiry marched forward, another investigation consumed Washington on Monday. The Justice Department's internal watchdog released a long-awaited report sharply criticizing the F.B.I. for its handling of a wiretap application in the early stages of its Russia investigation. But the report also undercut Mr. Trump's claims that former F.B.I. leaders tried to sabotage him for political reasons. Both Mr. Trump and his critics claimed vindication.But it was competing written reports on the Ukraine matter submitted last week by Democrats and Republicans that preoccupied the House. Though the facts recited on Capitol Hill on Monday have become well known over the past two months, including through public testimony from a dozen witnesses, the hearing provided the clearest account yet of the respective cases.During his 45-minute presentation, Mr. Goldman described ""a monthslong scheme"" by the president ""to solicit foreign help in his 2020 re-election campaign, withholding official acts from the government of Ukraine in order to coerce and secure political interference in our domestic affairs.""Mr. Goldman said that Mr. Trump was continuing to this day to try to distort next year's election with false allegations, pointing to his statements to reporters over the weekend claiming that Rudolph W. Giuliani, his personal lawyer, would make a report to the Justice Department about Democrats.""The scheme by President Trump was so brazen, so clear -- supported by documents, actions, sworn testimony, uncontradicted contemporaneous records -- that it's hard to imagine that anybody could dispute those acts, let alone argue that that conduct does not constitute an impeachable offense or offenses,"" said Mr. Berke, the Judiciary Committee lawyer.Both lawyers also noted that the White House had systematically tried to obstruct their inquiry. A dozen witnesses, including senior White House officials who could shed light on key events, were blocked from testifying, and the Trump administration did not provide a single document to investigators despite several subpoenas.Republicans lamented again and again that the Democrat who led the inquiry, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, did not testify himself about the report. They propped up a large poster on the dais that pictured a milk carton missing-person alert: ""Missing: Adam Schiff.""Even after two and a half months of sparring, the complaints by Republicans reached new levels of vitriol. Democrats showed little patience for hearing out their criticisms, and Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the Judiciary Committee's chairman, made liberal use of his gavel as he tried to maintain order in the face of Republican efforts to interrupt the hearing with parliamentary tactics.""Bang the gavel harder -- still doesn't make it right,"" said Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee.""They have talked about everything else, but they have offered not one substantive word in the president's defense,"" Mr. Nadler said of the Republicans in his closing remarks. In a letter sent during the hearing, he rejected Republicans' requests to call witnesses including Mr. Schiff, Mr. Biden's son Hunter and the anonymous C.I.A. whistle-blower whose complaint helped start the inquiry. Republicans could demand a vote on the matter at a later date.Republican lawmakers fumed when Mr. Berke, who appeared at a witness table at the start of the hearing to deliver his argument against Mr. Trump, later climbed onto the dais and led the cross-examination of Mr. Castor, who was also representing the Intelligence Committee lawyer. It is highly unusual for House lawyers to testify in hearings, for Mr. Castor to be testifying on behalf of two committees and for one lawyer to question another in that way, but all were allowed under the rules.""He's badgering the witness,"" Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, shot out as Mr. Berke pressed Mr. Castor.""He is not,"" Mr. Nadler fired back.Republicans seized on a small subset of evidence in the report to accuse Democrats of what Mr. Collins called ""a gratuitous drive-by"" targeting a conservative journalist and a Republican lawmaker.At issue were a half-dozen subpoenas issued by Democrats that turned up call records between the journalist, John Solomon of The Hill; Representative Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee; and subjects of the investigation, including Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Collins said he had no problem with the subpoenas, but demanded to know who decided to name Mr. Nunes and Mr. Solomon in the report.""Folks, you have made Joe McCarthy look like a piker,"" Mr. Sensenbrenner said.Mr. Goldman declined to discuss investigative decisions, but said such identifications were typical when examining phone records in an inquiry like this. The calls noted in the report all took place around key events under scrutiny.""We did not seek to do any investigation on a member of Congress or a staff member,"" Mr. Goldman said. ""It just happened to be they were in communication with a member of the president's scheme.""Peter Baker, Michael D. Shear and Catie Edmondson contributed reporting.PhotographDaniel S. Goldman, an Intelligence Committee lawyer who led the Ukraine inquiry, during his testimony on Monday.

| Jump to first hitIn a race where many voters are following politics online, Mr. Biden's pullback is a striking and potentially worrisome sign about his appeal among the digitally active.Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s presidential campaign has sharply scaled back his online advertising, cutting spending so severely since August that he is now investing only a fraction of what his top rivals are on Facebook and Google, the two dominant internet platforms.In a race where many voters are following politics on their smartphones, Mr. Biden's pullback is an unusual and potentially worrisome sign about his appeal among the Democratic activists, young people and donors who are especially engaged on social media. Candidates rarely withdraw so much money from their online campaigns unless they are seeing weak results in online fund-raising, according to interviews with digital strategists.Mr. Biden and other candidates will start announcing fund-raising results as early as Tuesday morning for the third quarter of 2019; he came in second for the last quarter, behind Pete Buttigieg, pulling in online money early but mostly relying on big donors. More recently, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and other top rivals have outspent Mr. Biden online: He was only the sixth-biggest Democratic spender on Facebook ads in the seven days ending Saturday, even as he began spending more money on digital ads targeting President Trump, Ukraine and impeachment.Instead, he has shifted his spending priorities toward traditional tactics like buying television ads in Iowa. But that strategy has not paid dividends so far: Ms. Warren, a leading rival for the 2020 nomination, recently surpassed him in a key Iowa poll.Mr. Biden's campaign strategy has been driven, from the start, by the political assumption that the Democratic electorate is more moderate than the progressives who are often loudest online, and he has built his candidacy around appealing to older and more centrist voters. But strategists say Mr. Biden's online pullback is risky if he hopes to engage and build support among a broader cross-section of Democrats that is almost certainly necessary to win the nomination.""It's clear that there's something in the numbers that's directing them to go in that direction, and the likeliest explanation is that the rate of return just wasn't there for Facebook and Google,"" said Tim Lim, a veteran Democratic digital strategist unaligned in 2020. ""Which is very, very unusual.""Zac Moffatt, a Republican strategist who led digital operations for Mitt Romney's presidential run, said abandoning a medium used heavily by so many ""reeks of desperation.""""You are spending at least a third to half your life on your mobile phone, and they're deciding they don't need to have a message for you there,"" Mr. Moffatt said.Online spending serves two purposes: Promoting the candidates' messages and raising money. The Biden campaign said it was committed to an ongoing digital plan, with a seven-figure digital ad buy planned in the fourth quarter of 2019. But if Mr. Biden struggles to collect small donations online, he will have to depend more on traditional donors and bundlers while his two leading rivals, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, emphasize their grass-roots support.The decline of Mr. Biden's online spending has been precipitous. He entered the race in April as one of the contest's biggest digital advertisers, spending $1.2 million on Facebook and Google in his first two weeks. Now he is toward the back of the pack.During a 30-day stretch leading up to the September debate, Mr. Biden, who has regularly led the field in national polls, ranked 16th among the Democratic presidential candidates for advertising on Facebook, spending only $32,000 -- placing the former vice president behind two candidates who dropped out during that period and five who did not make the debate stage.And on Google, his spending plunged to $300 during one week in August -- less than one-thousandth of what he spent in his first week as a candidate, when campaigns often spend the most. Ms. Warren spent $66,000 that same week.The Biden campaign cast its diminishing digital footprint as part of a broader strategy.""Our campaign invested a robust digital spend early on to build out supporter lists, outspending all other campaigns from our launch through most of the summer,"" said T.J. Ducklo, a spokesman for Mr. Biden. ""By strategically front-loading our investment, we were able to rapidly expand our reach early, instead of meting out our spend over a longer period of time.""Mr. Biden's digital spending has ticked up in recent days, as he bought a slate of Facebook ads related to Mr. Trump's efforts to have Ukraine investigate the Biden family (""Stand with Joe,"" some ads say). The exploding story line about foreign interference and impeachment has been good for Mr. Biden's bottom line: A campaign official said the past week was Mr. Biden's best for fund-raising since the second week of his campaign.While Mr. Biden's Facebook ads, like his stump speech, have focused heavily on Mr. Trump, records show he has also tested messages on health care, Medicare, the Supreme Court and guns.The Biden campaign noted that it was still investing in other online platforms that make less advertising data available to the public, such as Spotify, Amazon and Hulu. Mr. Biden began his campaign with a show of strength, raising $6.3 million in the first 24 hours from nearly 100,000 people. He began with a key advantage: Formerly President Barack Obama's running mate, he had access to the old email list from the Obama campaigns. Daily fund-raising data through June shows that Mr. Biden's first days were his strongest for attracting online donations.But in the last six weeks for which data is available, Mr. Biden spent a meager $20,900 on Google, a platform that includes both the internet's dominant search engine and YouTube. In that same six-week span, Ms. Warren spent more than 25 times as much: $553,700.""It is not a good sign for his campaign,"" said Marne Pike, the chief executive of a Democratic digital strategy firm not affiliated with any 2020 candidate. ""I would have a very hard time imagining no one was searching for Joe Biden and clicking on the ads.""It was a similar story on Facebook. There, Mr. Buttigieg has been the top spender, outpacing Mr. Biden in the last 30 days by a ratio of about 12 to 1.Mr. Biden is being outspent by candidates who, like him, are household names with big campaign budgets (like Mr. Sanders, by more than 7 to 1 in the last 30 days), and also by lesser-known figures (the former housing secretary Julián Castro, who has struggled to raise money, by more than 2 to 1).As Mr. Biden has withdrawn from Facebook and Google, he has bought up more than $700,000 in television ads in recent weeks in Iowa. Despite those ads, Ms. Warren recently edged ahead of him in the closely monitored Des Moines Register poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers.Mr. Ducklo, the Biden spokesman, said small contributions ""have been essential to getting our campaign message in front of voters: funding our television ads in Iowa and rapidly expanding the field operations in the early states that is knocking doors and making calls.""Andrew Bleeker, president of the Democratic digital firm Bully Pulpit Interactive, said that Mr. Biden's more moderate position in the Democratic primary could make it harder to raise money online. ""From a brand perspective, he can't be that incendiary and that's what's rewarded online,"" he said.Keegan Goudiss, who served as Mr. Sanders's director of digital advertising in 2016 but is unaligned in 2020, agreed: ""Joe Biden hasn't thrown the kind of red meat he needs to throw to do well online.""Mr. Biden has also wrapped his candidacy in an aura of inevitability, which does not allow him to sound the alarm to supporters, a tactic that can juice online giving. (Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, for instance, recently scored his biggest day for online donations when he said he would quit the 2020 race if he failed to raise $1.7 million by the end of this month.)One startling measure of Mr. Biden's diminished online fund-raising ambition is the goal his campaign announced for the last days of September: raising $500,000.By contrast, Mr. Buttigieg set out to raise $1.5 million online, Senator Kamala Harris of California $1 million, former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas $750,000 and the businessman Andrew Yang $1.5 million.At this juncture in the election cycle -- with the first primary votes still more than four months away -- most campaigns with spare money are still spending heavily online for what they call ""acquisition"": convincing people to give their email addresses through petition drives, online surveys and the like. Those people are then wooed to become donors.But for Mr. Biden, an analysis of both the content and geographic distribution of his ads suggests he had mostly abandoned trying to acquire new online donors in the last month -- at least until the recent Ukraine controversy. The Biden campaign said it had put $40,000 into ads over two days last week, more than it spent on Facebook during that recent 30-day stretch.The ads that Mr. Biden has been running target an older electorate than that of his top rivals, according to demographic data collected by Bully Pulpit. An overwhelming share of his spending on Facebook -- 84 percent -- has targeted voters who are 45 or older.Compare that to Mr. Sanders, who recently touted that the most common age among his donors is 29. Only one-third of his Facebook ad budget has targeted those above 45.PhotographCampaigns use digital ads to collect email addresses that they can later use for soliciting donations.Word count: 1593Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hitSpeculating on the unlikely possibility of four separate winners in the four early states.First, it was the fears of a contested convention. Then came the fretting about the strength of the field.So, what's the latest break-glass scenario worrying Democrats? Well, it's something I've taken to calling the Four-Way Cluster.Here's the thinking:Pete Buttigieg is surging in Iowa, so he wins the caucuses. Then, Elizabeth Warren comes rushing back in New Hampshire. Bernie Sanders, known for his ability to organize caucus states and for his support from Latinos, picks up Nevada. And Joe Biden, who has the most support from black voters of anyone in the field, captures South Carolina.Democrats arrive at Super Tuesday on March 3 with four winners in four states -- and no clear front-runner. Cue former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. As we've written, he's skipping the first four early states and plans to start competing on Super Tuesday -- with hundreds of millions in television ads and hundreds of staffers.All five of those candidates have enough funds that could keep them in the race for quite a while. So, a divided slate of wins could stretch the primary into the spring and raise the chances of Democrats arriving at their convention without a clear leader for the nomination.This is not a scenario that makes anyone in the Democratic Party all that happy, as my colleague Jonathan Martin wrote this weekend.Rice University's Baker Institute invited me to participate today in their annual conference on presidential elections. And there, as in other corners of the political world, there was chatter about the Four-Way Cluster.""There's a better chance than not that we go to Milwaukee without a nominee,"" the Democratic strategist James Carville told the audience, in his signature Louisiana drawl. ""I don't think anything is a given in U.S. politics.""But is the Four-Way Cluster just another manifestation of Democratic anxiety? Probably. At least according to those closest to the race.Aides to top candidates told me that the scenario was unlikely: Once candidates start winning, their victories shake up the race, changing the dynamics. Besides, they added, we're still weeks from the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3. A lot of voters -- particularly in Nevada and South Carolina -- simply aren't paying attention yet.Josh Putnam, a political scientist who writes the blog FrontloadingHQ, which tracks the details of the primary process, urged the audience to watch the 15 percent threshold that candidates must meet in these primaries to pick up delegates in the race.He expects Democrats to know their nominee by the end of April, when more than 80 percent of the delegates will have been distributed. As for the prospect of a contested convention? ""Overblown,"" he says.What we can say for certain is that Democrats remain fiercely divided. Eight weeks before the first round of voting in Iowa, no singular candidate has tapped into the deep unhappiness with President Trump to capture the imagination of Democratic voters.At this point, the race remains remarkably fluid.My advice? Brace yourself for some major twists this spring.Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We'll try to answer it. Have a comment? We're all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com .John Kerry Returns to the Spotlight in New Hampshire""Good morning, Nashua!"" former Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Sunday as he opened his remarks inside a frigid community college gymnasium. ""It is great to be back in the Granite State.""Indeed, Mr. Kerry appeared happy to be back. This time, however, he was not campaigning for himself; he was making two Sunday campaign stops with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and trying to explain to voters who helped him win the 2004 Democratic primary why Mr. Biden should win it in 2020.Mr. Kerry argued that his former Senate colleague and fellow member of the Obama administration had the wisdom and experience to hit the ground running and quickly restore America's standing in the world.""I've worked with this man,"" Mr. Kerry said. ""I know that Joe Biden is the person who can beat Donald Trump and bring this country back together.""But he also seemed more than happy to take a trip down memory lane. He used much of his 20-minute address -- double the time of Mr. Biden's remarks -- to regale voters with the tales of town halls ""where the air cracked with skepticism"" and gymnasiums filled with people who ""really listened"" and would eventually help his struggling campaign rebound.As for Mr. Biden, he continued his efforts to conduct intimate conversations with voters. He kept his prepared remarks short and paced the stage while giving them; that left more time for questions and answers during which Mr. Biden made sure to turn and face the people asking questions and address them up close.At his second event in Hampton, N.H., one questioner told Mr. Biden he had seen his tense moment with a voter in Iowa last week, when a man had said Mr. Biden was ""too old"" for the job of president.Then, in a move borrowed from Mr. Biden's playbook, the man looked Mr. Biden in the eye and said what he and other voters I have talked to strongly felt: ""I want you to know that I am 87 years old, and I don't think you are.""-- Matt Stevens, Politics reporter...

| Jump to first hitThe president's private lawyer explored agreements with Ukrainian officials for hundreds of thousands of dollars.As Rudolph W. Giuliani waged a public campaign this year to unearth damaging information in Ukraine about President Trump's political rivals, he privately pursued hundreds of thousands of dollars in business from Ukrainian government officials, documents reviewed by The New York Times show.Mr. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, has repeatedly said he has no business in Ukraine, and none of the deals were finalized. But the documents indicate that while he was pushing Mr. Trump's agenda with Ukrainian officials eager for support from the United States, Mr. Giuliani also explored financial agreements with members of the same government.His discussions with Ukrainian officials, including the country's top prosecutor, who assisted him on the dirt-digging mission, proceeded far enough along that he signed at least one retainer agreement, on his company letterhead.In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Giuliani played down the discussions. He said that a Ukrainian official approached him this year seeking to hire him personally. Mr. Giuliani said he dismissed that suggestion, but spent about a month considering a separate deal with the Ukrainian government. He then rejected that idea.""I thought that would be too complicated,"" Mr. Giuliani said. ""I never received a penny.""Mr. Giuliani's shadow diplomacy campaign in Ukraine on behalf of the president is a central focus of the current House impeachment inquiry.At the same time, a federal criminal investigation into Mr. Giuliani is examining his role in the campaign to oust Marie L. Yovanovitch, the American ambassador to Ukraine, and scrutinizing any financial dealings he may have had with Ukrainian officials, according to people briefed on the matter.Prosecutors and F.B.I. agents in Manhattan are scrutinizing whether Mr. Giuliani was not just working for the president, but also doing the bidding of Ukrainian officials who wanted the ambassador removed for their own reasons, the people said.It is a federal crime to try to influence the United States government at the request or direction of a foreign government, politician or party without registering as a foreign agent. Mr. Giuliani did not register as one, he has said, because he was acting on behalf of his client, Mr. Trump, not Ukrainians.Mr. Giuliani has not been accused of wrongdoing.The federal inquiry focused on Mr. Giuliani grew out of the case against two of his associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were arrested on campaign finance charges last month. Alongside Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman worked to pressure Ukraine into announcing investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter.Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman have pleaded not guilty to the campaign finance charges.Spokesmen for the United States attorney in the Southern District of New York, Geoffrey S. Berman, whose prosecutors are handling the case, and the F.B.I. declined to comment.The documents reviewed by The Times portray an evolving effort over the course of several months by Mr. Giuliani and lawyers close to him to consider taking on various Ukrainian officials or their agencies as clients.The Times could not determine whether the documents it reviewed comprised the entirety of discussions between Mr. Giuliani and other lawyers about representing Ukrainian government officials.The documents date to mid-February, when one draft proposal said Mr. Giuliani would represent Yuriy Lutsenko, who was then Ukraine's top prosecutor. At the time, Mr. Giuliani had been working with Mr. Lutsenko to encourage investigations into the Bidens and the 2016 election.The draft proposal, which was unsigned and not on letterhead, called for Mr. Lutsenko to pay $200,000 to retain Giuliani Partners, Mr. Giuliani's firm, and a husband-and-wife legal team aligned with Mr. Trump, Joseph E. diGenova and Victoria Toensing.In return, Mr. Giuliani would help the government recover money it believed had been stolen and stashed overseas, advising Mr. Lutsenko ""on Ukrainian claims for the recovery of sums of money in various financial institutions outside Ukraine.""The proposal came a few weeks after Mr. Giuliani met at his office in New York with Mr. Lutsenko to discuss Ukrainian corruption. Mr. Lutsenko told Mr. Giuliani and others about payments he claimed involved Mr. Biden, Hunter Biden and Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian company that had named the younger Mr. Biden to its board, according to a memo summarizing the talks. Mr. Lutsenko also shared information he said he had about Ms. Yovanovitch.Mr. Giuliani was critical of Ms. Yovanovitch, whom he and other Republicans have said was opposed to the president. Mr. Giuliani's moves against her, however, were also aligned with the interests of Mr. Lutsenko, who had butted heads with the ambassador.Ultimately, Ms. Yovanovitch was removed from her post in May, and Mr. Lutsenko was replaced in August after a new Ukrainian president took office.In the interview, Mr. Giuliani said that after their meeting, Mr. Lutsenko broached the idea of hiring him to help deliver information about corruption in Ukraine to United States authorities.Although Mr. Giuliani worked for free for Mr. Trump, he said he concluded that it would be a potential conflict of interest for him to represent the Ukrainian prosecutor in that capacity.Still, he said, Mr. Lutsenko also wanted to hire Mr. Giuliani to help recover Ukrainian assets.An updated proposal was circulated a few days later, along with instructions on how to wire money to Giuliani Partners. This version made no mention of Mr. Lutsenko, but instead sought $300,000 from the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice and the Republic of Ukraine. The proposal was signed by Mr. Giuliani, but not by the justice minister at the time, Pavlo Petrenko.Asked why he signed that agreement and pursued payment, Mr. Giuliani said he considered the deal in order to learn more about the recovery of assets and money laundering in Ukraine.""It did not come out of my desire to make a lot of money,"" he said, adding that his typical retainer is much higher than a few hundred thousand dollars.""Originally, I thought I would do it. And then when I thought it over,"" he said, ""I thought it would look bad.""The Ukrainian Ministry of Justice said Wednesday that it did not enter into any contracts or make payments to Mr. Giuliani.In March, a document proposed that the Ukrainian justice ministry would hire Ms. Toensing and Mr. diGenova for help with asset recovery. But it said that the General Prosecutor's office, run by Mr. Lutsenko, would pay $300,000 to Giuliani Partners.Several later draft retainer agreements involved Ms. Toensing and Mr. diGenova but did not reference Mr. Giuliani.In April, Mr. Lutsenko reappeared as a potential client in some new versions of documents, along with one of his deputies. Under the proposals, which were signed only by Ms. Toensing and printed on her law firm's letterhead, she and Mr. diGenova would represent the officials ""in connection with recovery and return to the Ukraine government of funds illegally embezzled from that country.""The proposed April agreement between Mr. Lutsenko and Ms. Toensing and Mr. diGenova also referenced another assignment: helping him meet with American officials about ""the evidence of illegal conduct in Ukraine regarding the United States, for example, interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.""Asked for comment by The Times, a spokeswoman for Mr. Lutsenko, Larisa Sarhan, on Wednesday referred to an interview Mr. Lutsenko gave to a Ukrainian news outlet confirming that aides to Mr. Giuliani had asked him to hire a lobbying company. He did not specify which company.Mr. Lutsenko told Ukrainska Pravda he had been seeking a meeting with William P. Barr, the United States attorney general, and was in touch with unnamed advisers to Mr. Giuliani.""In the end, they said the meeting would be impossible unless I hired a company that would lobby for such a meeting,"" Mr. Lutsenko told the news outlet, adding that he declined to do that.The proposals noted that Ms. Toensing and Mr. diGenova might have to register as foreign agents under American law.""We have always stated that we agreed to represent Ukrainian whistle-blowers,"" Mark Corallo, a representative for the law firm of Ms. Toensing and Mr. diGenova, said in a statement on Wednesday.Mr. Corallo said the business proposals were ""unaccepted"" and the lawyers never represented the Ukrainians. ""No money was ever received and no legal work was ever performed,"" he said.In another agreement signed by Ms. Toensing in April, the client would have been Victor Shokin, the top Ukrainian prosecutor before Mr. Lutsenko. Mr. Shokin was ousted after critics, among them Mr. Biden, said he was soft on corruption.Mr. Shokin did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Shokin had also spoken with Mr. Giuliani and his associates in January, via Skype. In the call, Mr. Shokin asserted that American officials applied pressure on the Ukrainian government to kill an investigation of Burisma, and that he was fired after Mr. Biden accused the prosecutor of being corrupt, according to a memo summarizing the discussion.Ms. Toensing proposed that, for $25,000 a month, her firm would represent Mr. Shokin ""for the purpose of collecting evidence regarding his March 2016 firing as Prosecutor General of Ukraine and the role of then-Vice President Joe Biden in such firing, and presenting such evidence to U.S. and foreign authorities.""The news of Mr. Giuliani's efforts comes a day after Mr. Trump appeared to distance himself from Mr. Giuliani.In an interview on Tuesday, the former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly asked Mr. Trump if he had directed Mr. Giuliani in his Ukraine efforts. ""No, I didn't direct him, but he is a warrior, he is a warrior,"" Mr. Trump said.When asked what work Mr. Giuliani was doing for him related to Ukraine, Mr. Trump replied, ""You have to ask that to Rudy.""Andrew E.

| Jump to first hitThis year the president's tweets, gaffes, hirings, firings and foibles again dominated late-night monologues and bits.""I don't want to talk about Donald Trump every night. None of us do. But he gives us no choice.""That was Jimmy Kimmel. In March. It's safe to say he talked about President Trump nearly every night since.Kimmel's lament was emblematic of the fact that, in late-night comedy, 2019 was yet another year dominated by Trump's tweets, gaffes, comments, decisions, hirings, firings and foibles. The Trump Administration so totally dominated late-night monologues and bits, it's more useful to break up the year into mini-eras of Trump: The Mueller Report era, the whistle-blower era, the ongoing impeachment era.And even when Trump wasn't Topic A, politics still was, as more than 20 Democratic hopefuls entered the race to run against him in 2020.Kimmel's March complaint was actually prompted by a tweet from Trump agreeing with a former host, Jay Leno, who said in an interview that he found current late-night shows to be ""one-sided.""If Trump ""sat in the White House all day quietly working on things, I would almost never mention him, because it's not interesting,"" Kimmel countered in his monologue. ""But today -- not even today, before 10 a.m. today, before 10 o'clock this morning, his former campaign chairman was sentenced to prison for the second time in a week, he called himself the most successful president in history and he tweeted to let people know his wife hasn't been replaced with a body double.""I'm not supposed to mention that?""Mueller Fails to Excite[Video: Watch on YouTube.]The long-awaited Mueller Report was finally released to the public in April, in the form of a heavily redacted 448-page document.""Political analysts are going to try to read through these redactions like teenage boys trying to watch scrambled porn on cable in 1985."" -- JIMMY KIMMELMueller's report was followed by his highly anticipated testimony in July, which Stephen Colbert called ""the Super Bowl of things on C-Span at 8:30 in the morning."" But Mueller's performance, full of references to ""inconclusive"" findings and subjects that were ""outside my purview,"" did not satisfy Trump's opponents.""What were you expecting? Did you think Mueller was going to smash through the wall in a monster truck called the DeTrumpulator?"" -- SETH MEYERSMueller was so widely described as boring on the stand, on ""The Late Show,"" Colbert joked that ""he only got 35 percent on Rotten Tomatoes."" But Colbert also said he wasn't interested in a government who cared about ratings, ""because we already have that with Donald Trump.""And while the president claimed he wouldn't be watching any part of the hearings, Kimmel pointed out that Trump spent his entire day tweeting about them.""He tweeted more than 20 times today, capping the tweetstorm off with this: 'Truth is a force of nature!' And we all know how much respect he has for nature, so."" -- JIMMY KIMMELAny Way the Whistle Blows[Video: Watch on YouTube.]While interest in the Mueller Report quickly faded, it was soon followed by a whistle-blower complaint with allegations that Trump required a quid pro quo from the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky.In April, late night made one of its earliest mentions of Zelensky, now somewhat of a household name. Conan O'Brien pointed out that the incoming president was a fellow stand-up comedian who'd spent some time on television.""I looked up their Constitution: The order of succession in Ukraine goes comedian, juggler, magician, then secretary of defense. That's how it works. After hearing about it, Elizabeth Warren signed up for improv classes."" -- CONAN O'BRIEN""Who would believe Volodymyr Zelensky would be his Monica Lewinsky?"" Kimmel later joked of Trump in September, as details of the president's July call emerged. In his statement, the whistle-blower said several U.S. officials confirmed Trump was hoping Zelensky would ""play ball,"" and Colbert couldn't pass up a chance to poke fun.""[Imitating Trump] 'O.K., Ukraine. You gotta play ball, O.K.? And I mean let me get to second base, O.K.? Over the bra, under the Constitution."" -- STEPHEN COLBERTWith the current impeachment hearings continuing, Trump is sure to be a focus throughout the holiday season, as late-night hosts wait for an opportunity to talk about something and someone else.The President Would Like a Retraction[Video: Watch on YouTube.]In October, Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's communications director, demanded Kimmel issue a retraction for suggesting the president was golfing during the Delta Force raid that killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. On air, Kimmel admitted he'd been wrong.""Trump was at one of his golf courses for the 238th time since taking office,"" Kimmel said. ""But he finished the round, and was back at the White House by 5 o'clock. Whether or not they were waiting for him to finish the round -- I imagine Delta Force sitting there in the choppers, locked and loaded going, 'What hole is he on now?""'Kimmel then called for Trump to retract ""the weird detailed lie"" the president shared at a 2018 rally in South Carolina. (Trump claimed Kimmel fawned over him when he appeared on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live."")""And while you're working on factual accuracy, your boss has now lied in public approximately 14,000 times since he took office,"" Kimmel continued, in response to Murtaugh. ""He should probably start the retracting and correcting soon because he's 73.""Playing the Candidates[Video: Watch on YouTube.]The only 2019 rivals to Trump's screen time were the numerous democratic hopefuls for 2020. Some clear front-runners have emerged, with Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg consistently polling highest, though not necessarily in that order. These politicians prove a little more difficult to imitate than Trump, but it doesn't mean Jimmy Fallon hasn't tried on ""The Tonight Show.""""Nowadays, most of you recognize me from the rallying cries of hope and unity that I've stirred across the nation. But the rest of you know me from my hit series, 'The Boy Who Became Mayor,' only on Disney Channel."" -- JIMMY FALLON, impersonating ButtigiegAs the candidates made their rounds on late night, no interviews were more entertaining than Desus and Mero's. The Showtime co-hosts played basketball with Cory Booker, grilled Senator Sanders on his favorite rappers and challenged Senator Warren, who has a plan for everything, to help them complete an escape room.[Video: Watch on YouTube.]Biden offered plenty of fodder for mockery, with his inappropriate touching, frequent gaffes and new campaign slogan: ""No malarkey."" The former vice president was also ridiculed for his frequent name-dropping of President Obama.""[Biden] spent eight years as America's vice president and surprise masseuse, but before that, he had a whole career that you might not know about. You know, kind of like how some people only know Billy Ray Cyrus from Lil Nas X's 'Old Town Road' remix. And like Billy Ray, Biden was doing his own thing for decades before he was made cool by a young black man."" -- TREVOR NOAHQueer Capitalism[Video: Watch on YouTube.]Late-night shows weren't entirely focused on presidential politics. For example, in June, the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising, a pivotal moment in the gay rights movement, inspired plenty of tribute, remote bits and satire. Much of it mocked the commercialization of Pride Month, ""the time of the year where we all celebrate the L.G.B.T.Q. community and corporate America celebrates them by selling us, Rainbow Goodyear tires,"" Colbert joked. ""Yasss, traction!""Both ""The Daily Show With Trevor Noah"" and ""Full Frontal with Samantha Bee"" sent correspondents on the road. In honor of the Stonewall anniversary, Jaboukie Young-White took ""The Daily Show"" to Pittsburgh's Pride Parade, looking to find out if companies like Walmart are gay and if ""queer capitalism is totally chill.""In New York, the transgender comic Patti Harrison went to the Stonewall Inn for ""Full Frontal,"" exploring the history of gay liberation and Pride celebrations, which she joked was started by United Airlines, Citigroup, Postmates, Tesla, YouTube, Android and the Trump campaign.[Video: Watch on YouTube.]In 2018, Harrison and the comic Julio Torres satirically pitched the idea of Straight Pride on ""The Tonight Show,"" and this year, someone actually followed through. A Boston-based group called Super Happy Fun America launched its own Straight Pride Parade this summer. ""It's so troll-y!"" Trevor Noah said. ""Especially a straight parade in Boston. The city has had six Super Bowl parades. What do you think that is?""""If you're wondering the difference between the Gay Pride Parade and the Straight Pride Parade, the Gay Pride Parade will have women at it."" -- STEPHEN COLBERTWhen Hosts Attack ... Each Other[Video: Watch on YouTube.]The mockery got intramural in September, when ""The Late Late Show"" host James Corden, best known for his star-studded ""Carpool Karaoke"" and ""Crosswalk the Musical"" segments, criticized Bill Maher for his comments about fat shaming on ""Real Time with Bill Maher."" (Maher insinuated that overweight people should be shamed into losing weight.)""So I sat at home, and I'm watching this and all I could think as I was watching was, 'Oh man, somebody needs to say something about this,""' Corden said. ""'If only there was someone with a platform who knew what it was actually like to be overweight' ... and then I realized, 'Aah, that will be me.""'Corden, who follows Colbert on CBS, acknowledged that he and Maher, who shares HBO with John Oliver, have a lot in common -- ""We both host the second most popular talk shows on our network"" -- and that Maher has always been kind to him in person. But as for Maher's comments about how overweight men cannot see their own nether regions, Corden responded: ""Believe me, I can see a [expletive].""""Bill, please hear me when I say this,"" Corden said in conclusion. ""While you're encouraging people to think about what goes into their mouths, just think a little harder about what comes out of yours.""The Best of the RestSome of the most memorable sketches of 2019 had nothing to do with Trump, particularly a few built around celebrity stunts. Exhibit A: the enviable ""Day Drinking with Rihanna"" on ""Late Night with Seth Meyers.""[Video: Watch on YouTube.]Brad Pitt and Fallon just couldn't stop showing each other their gratitude in ""Courtesy of the Gentleman at the Bar.""[Video: Watch on YouTube.]Finally, a fictional political era -- one that seemed comparatively less outlandish by the week -- came to an end this year when HBO's ""Veep"" wrapped up its seven-season run in May. Colbert offered a fitting send-off, hosting a very special crossover episode on ""The Late Show.""[Video: Watch on YouTube.]The bit featured some of beloved stars of ""Veep,"" including, of course President Selina Meyer, who laughed off Colbert's suggestion that their actions had real-world consequences.""Foul-mouthed president who tweets like a child. Blaming everything on the Chinese. Election interference. A completely moronic press secretary,"" Colbert says. ""Anti-daylight savings time laws, 700 measles cases and rising. You are killing my world!""Meyer's rather Trump-like response hit below the belt: ""Another 85 pounds of generic white male mediocrity that shops at the lesbian warehouse.""""Seriously,"" she added, ""you look like Letterman took the least funny dump of his life into a child suit.""PhotographPHOTOS (PHOTOGRAPHS BY RANDY HOLMES/ABC; SCOTT KOWALCHYK/CBS VIA GETTY IMAGES; DIMITRIOS KAMBOURIS/GETTY IMAGES) (C1); PHOTO (PHOTOGRAPH BY ANDREW LIPOVSKY/NBC) (C6)Word count: 1850Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hitNot so long ago, it seemed to Rudolph W. Giuliani that he would be presiding over a hefty part of the world.Holding court a few nights after the 2016 election in a private cigar bar on Fifth Avenue, glass of Macallan at hand, Mr. Giuliani boasted to friends that President-elect Donald J. Trump would soon nominate him to the most prestigious of cabinet posts.""How about,"" Mr. Giuliani asked, ""secretary of state?""Chief global representative of the United States in war, peace and trade.It would be a sublime reward for having thrown in with Mr. Trump when the respectable Republican establishment was keeping its distance, a fresh burst of stardom in a public life that had been fading fast. Mr. Giuliani made himself indispensable to the Trump campaign by doing dirty work that no one else wanted and trudging ahead even after the candidate lashed him with humiliations.Three years on, Mr. Giuliani never got the job he believed he had coming -- ""a bitter disappointment,"" his now-estranged wife says -- but in his five decades as a public figure, he has never been more prominent in national affairs.Step by step, he has escorted President Trump to the brink of impeachment. Mr. Giuliani himself is now under criminal investigation by federal prosecutors in the very office where he enjoyed his first extended draughts of fame nearly four decades ago. The separate troubles he has gotten his client and himself into are products of the uniquely powerful position he has fashioned, a hybrid of unpaid personal counsel to the president and for-profit peddler of access and advice.Practically no name, other than Mr. Trump's, was mentioned more than Mr. Giuliani's at the impeachment hearings and in a subsequent Democratic report that described him as the hub of a grievous abuse of presidential power (or legitimate advocate for Mr. Trump, in the Republicans' minority response).A dozen witnesses testified over five days, and if Mr. Giuliani were somehow subtracted from their stories, there seems to be no one in or out of government who could take his place as the president's man on the ground. No one to carry out a campaign to force a vulnerable ally, Ukraine, to damage a political opponent of Mr. Trump and undermine a special counsel investigation in ways that would help both Mr. Trump and an ally now in prison for laundering millions of dollars.No impeachment train, picking up steam.Mr. Giuliani has been the voice in Mr. Trump's ear when others could not be heard, and served as the voice of Mr. Trump in places where presidents dare not go.Each modern impeachment saga -- of Richard M. Nixon, Bill Clinton and now Mr. Trump -- has been shaped not by grievances over policy differences, but by human vanities and appetites. In this case, those include Mr. Giuliani's, which have run in strong currents for decades, unconcealed.The forces that have returned Mr. Giuliani to the stage at age 75 are the same ones that made him a star federal prosecutor as a young man, a memorable mayor of New York in the 1990s and a scorched-earth advocate for Mr. Trump in 2016: his relentless drive to put himself at the center of public life and his very high regard for his own virtuousness.Patrick Oxford, a former law partner and chairman of Mr. Giuliani's 2008 presidential campaign, who praises him as ""a fine man,"" says he has not changed.""He's just a whole lot more of what he was,"" Mr. Oxford said. ""I've noticed that political figures have a hard time retiring from the scene. I think my friend Rudy may be trying too hard to remain involved.""[ Watch a special episode of ""The Weekly"" about Rudy Giuliani's wild, decades-long career. Available for Times subscribers in the U.S.]His personal life has descended into the sort of well-appointed shambles that material wealth can disguise, though not necessarily make any less fraught.A third marriage has fallen into divorce court ruins, revealing monthly expenses of $230,000 for six homes and 11 country club memberships. By taking President Trump as a client, he lost a position at a law firm in 2018 that paid him $6 million annually, according to court filings. In October, he broke with a partner in a security consultancy, a former police officer who had been at his side for three decades. He was so badly hurt in a fall two years ago that his wife put off divorce plans and looked after him for a while. She laments that before he appears in public, no one tells him that dye has given his hair an orange tinge.He betrays no distress at any aspect of his life, only delight.Working on a laptop at a restaurant table in the Trump International Hotel in Washington, he has bathed in the warm acclaim of friends and strangers who recognize him from his television advocacy. ""I enjoyed the fact that people were coming by and tapping me on the back,"" Mr. Giuliani said.He was there so often, he said, that he set up a plaque.Rudolph W. GiulianiAttorney at law""He doesn't just like the spotlight,"" his estranged wife, Judith Giuliani, said in an interview. ""He craves it, for validation.""She said she could scarcely believe he was working for Mr. Trump, given his disdain for people like Mr. Clinton, whom he saw as dishonest. But public attention, even refracted through Mr. Trump, was irresistible, she said.Perhaps that helps explain the velvet-glove treatment he lavished on two Soviet-born American businessmen.Mr. Giuliani brought one of them, a former penny-stock trader with a string of bad debts, to the state funeral of President George H. W. Bush last December.And both men were Mr. Giuliani's guests this year at an annual dinner he gives for a band of people, mostly city workers, knitted together after the Sept. 11 attacks.Other guests were perplexed by the men's presence.Had they been at Ground Zero in 2001?No, they had not.They were part not of Mr. Giuliani's past but of his wished-for future.He deployed both men to find pressure points in Ukraine, and joined them in undermining an American ambassador. His intentions, he says, were pure. ""As a person who finds public corruption a cancer,"" Mr. Giuliani said, ""I cannot ignore it.""He may also have been trying to improve the chances for Rudolph W. Giuliani to persist into his ninth decade as an indispensable man.The Thanks He GotPoised to take off from La Guardia Airport, the Trump campaign plane had to wait for one more passenger. It was a chilly, cloudy Sunday in New York, the 9th of October 2016. That evening, Mr. Trump would debate his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, in St. Louis.Inside the custom-fitted Boeing 757-200, about 40 people were in their seats, including candidate Trump. They could not leave without one last person: Rudy Giuliani.Why were they waiting for him?That moment, as much as any, maps the ground between Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani.They had known each other for nearly 40 years. Mr. Trump was the gaudy, gold-veneered developer who somehow navigated the shoals of organized crime, labor racketeering and official corruption in the New York real estate market of the 1980s, even as Mr. Giuliani was becoming so well known as a federal prosecutor that he kept a mental scorecard of his television appearances. (""Actually, it was only two nights,"" Mr. Giuliani told a man in 1985 who mentioned he had just seen him five times on television. ""Last week, it was five."")With Mr. Trump as co-chairman of his first campaign fund-raiser, Mr. Giuliani ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 1989. He won the next time, in 1993, and served until the end of 2001. For the world, he embodied resilience following Sept. 11, a stature he would parlay into wealth but not a successful presidential candidacy. After a dismal showing in the 2008 Republican primaries, in which he spent more than $60 million and won no delegates, he and Mrs. Giuliani retreated to her family's home in Florida. There he fell into what she called a lingering ""catatonic"" state. He never fully returned to his law firm, Bracewell Giuliani -- ""his specialty was being Rudy,"" his ex-partner, Mr. Oxford, said -- but in time resumed giving paid speeches and running a lucrative security consultancy.As the years of Barack Obama's presidency passed, Mr. Giuliani's voice seemed to carry farthest when it was keyed to harsh or apocalyptic tones. Faintly echoing Mr. Trump's falsehood about the president's origins, he questioned Mr. Obama's Americanism (""He wasn't brought up the way you were brought up, and I was brought up, through love of this country,"" he said). Apart from such flare-ups, he largely dropped out of public conversation.""Before the 2016 election, Rudy was running around hawking Life Lock on commercials that ran at 2 a.m. on channel 83,"" a longtime close aide said.Mr. Giuliani had not raced to sign on with Trump 2016, waiting until the nomination was nearly inevitable, but few bigger names beat him to it.Prominent Republicans who now style themselves devoted allies of Mr. Trump spoke of him then with acid revulsion or clenched-teeth neutrality. The campaign needed someone able to dial into a steady state of rage on a moment's notice, even a high-mileage ex-politician scarcely known to a younger generation of voters.Given a speaking spot of honor at the Republican convention, Mr. Giuliani roared: ""There's -- there's -- there's no next election! This is it! There's no more time for us left to revive our great country!""During the last three months of the campaign, he spun like a tornado from one television studio to the next or jetted around the country, at every stop hurling charges of corruption like boiling brimstone at anyone standing in Mr. Trump's way.""He'd do an event with then-candidate Trump, and then he'd speak at a different event with Pence and then do one on his own,"" David Bossie, the deputy campaign manager, said.None of that compared to his work on the Sunday when the Trump campaign jet waited at La Guardia.Two days earlier, an off-camera tape from the television show ""Access Hollywood"" had been released of Mr. Trump speaking in crude terms about how his celebrity status gave him license to sexually assault women.Mr. Trump's usual surrogates -- Kellyanne Conway, Reince Priebus, Chris Christie -- had been booked to appear on the Sunday shows before the tape came out. When it did, they all bailed.Then Mr. Giuliani stepped forward.""Rudy was the only person willing to go on television to defend Donald Trump,"" Mr. Bossie said.Mr. Giuliani spent that morning rushing between studios -- he appeared on all five major networks -- pausing long enough to strike a penitential chord and write off Mr. Trump's words as unfortunate locker-room talk.Considering the circumstances, the campaign staff believed Mr. Giuliani had blunted the political blow Mr. Trump had inflicted on Mr. Trump. ""Most people thought he did a great job,"" Mr. Bossie said.When Mr. Giuliani boarded the plane, spent from his labors, he strode down the aisle a conquering hero, swapping high-fives. Then he settled across from Mr. Trump.Everyone could hear what the candidate said next.""Man, Rudy,"" Mr. Trump said, ""you sucked. You were weak. Low-energy.""Mr. Giuliani slumped in his seat, one witness said. The plane grew silent.By day's end, Mr. Giuliani was back in front of the cameras, claiming victory for Mr. Trump in the debate. And his most important work for the campaign was yet to come.SurpriseOn Oct. 25, 2016, exactly two weeks until Election Day, Mr. Giuliani appeared on ""Fox and Friends,"" and was asked what the Trump campaign would do with the remaining time.""We've got a couple of surprises left,"" Mr. Giuliani said, chuckling but coyly refusing to be drawn out on specifics.""I think he's got a surprise or two that you're going to hear about in the next few days,"" he told another interviewer. ""I mean, I'm talking about some pretty big surprises.""Unknown to the public, the F.B.I. had recently obtained a laptop used by one of Mrs. Clinton's aides that had not been examined during the investigation of her private email server. That inquiry had concluded in July without charges, but the newly discovered laptop contained about 50,000 emails that might have been relevant. F.B.I. agents planned to go through them in due course, but several ranking officials did not see that any mad rush was called for, the Justice Department inspector general would later report. They believed -- correctly, as it turned out -- that the emails would be similar to the hundreds of thousands already examined.Then Mr. Giuliani began dropping those broad hints of a ""surprise,"" adding that he knew F.B.I. agents were very upset. It seemed apparent to Attorney General Loretta Lynch that leaks were coming from the New York office of the F.B.I., according to the inspector general. Faced with the likelihood that word of the emails would be coming out one way or another, the F.B.I. director, James Comey, announced a review of the newly discovered cache. It played as a stunning piece of news, a fresh gust of scandal 11 days before the election.Mr. Giuliani would later deny that he had heard about the emails from F.B.I. agents, though he had bragged about that in broadcast interviews.Years before, he had shown that working with virtually nothing, he could cultivate the mere existence of investigations to his political benefit. Early in his first term as mayor, facing criticism over patronage hires, Mr. Giuliani and aides announced spectacular claims that a widely respected commissioner in the previous administration, Richard Murphy, had overspent his budget by millions of dollars for political reasons. Moreover, computer records seemed to have been destroyed in a suspicious burglary. The heat shifted from the reality of Mr. Giuliani's patronage hires to the wispy vapors of the Murphy investigation. A year later, it emerged that Mr. Murphy had neither overspent nor done anything wrong, and that no records had been destroyed or stolen. Mayor Giuliani shrugged.""This happens all the time,"" he said. ""And you write about those things all the time. Sometimes they turn out to be true. And sometimes they turn out to be wrong.""So it was with the emails. With two days to go until the 2016 election, Mr. Comey said the review of the material in the laptop had not changed the bureau's view that Mrs. Clinton had not committed a crime. The unquantifiable damage, though, had been done.Declaring victory on election night, Mr. Trump hailed his family and his campaign staff.One more person was singled out.""I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani,"" Mr. Trump shouted, to chants of ""Rudy, Rudy."" ""That Rudy never changes. Where's Rudy? Where is he?"" A moment later, spotting him, Mr. Trump called again, ""Oh, Rudy, get up here.""With that, Mr. Giuliani stepped onto the stage, holding his wife's hand, joining the Trump family.The Inner CircleRepresenting the president of the United States was, Mr. Giuliani said, ""kind of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.""He grabbed it. He strode across the public stage as a man without border or boundary, Full Throttle Giuliani -- ""I am a high-functioning human being, able to outwork people half my age,"" he told New York magazine -- blending the rare opportunity to serve the president with far more ordinary chances to profit from his closeness to power.He became a one-stop human bazaar for the trade of money, favors and influence, certain that he was incorruptible.""I'm probably the most ethical person you ever met,"" he said.There are conflicting accounts of why Mr. Giuliani did not get the State Department position he campaigned for in 2016, and of whether anyone other than himself even thought it was a real possibility, but his years of lucrative consulting payments from foreign governments since leaving City Hall would certainly have made for a complicated Senate confirmation.So he returned in January 2017 to his partnership at Greenberg Traurig. He was also running a consulting company, Giuliani Security & Safety, with mostly foreign clients.Yet for all that, he seemed to be itching to get back inside.Out of the blue, he would call John Dowd, an old colleague from their days as young lawyers. Mr. Dowd had known Mr. Giuliani as a 30-year-old prosecutor whose withering cross-examination drove a sitting congressman to halt his own trial and plead guilty.Now, though, Mr. Dowd was the president's chief lawyer in the special counsel's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Giuliani would phone just to volunteer suggestions or help, Mr. Dowd said.""When I had the lead,"" Mr. Dowd said, ""he always had my back.""In year one of the investigation, President Trump went through multiple lawyers, including Mr. Dowd. By spring 2018, Mr. Trump was having a hard time getting top legal talent to work on the case.Up stepped Mr. Giuliani, who said he would serve without pay.The Trump administration turned out to be very good for the business of being Rudy Giuliani, though it was no simple matter to say precisely what that was.""Probably in the last two years, people have talked to me about hundreds of deals,"" Mr. Giuliani said this fall.As an insurgent, Mr. Trump arrived in Washington without the camp followers of brand-name lobbyists and insiders who set up shop with each new administration. Their absence heightened the value of the few people known to have influence with Mr. Trump, like Mr. Giuliani. Before and after he became the president's personal lawyer, he thrived.He hired himself out to a Turkish money launderer, Reza Zarrab, and argued his case directly to the president and the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, in the Oval Office. Mr. Zarrab had been accused of moving $10 billion in gold and cash to Iran, evading American sanctions. He eventually pleaded guilty and became a prosecution witness.That was not the only piece of Turkish business Mr. Giuliani brought before the president, or so aides to Mr. Trump suspected. They believed that on his regular visits to the White House, he was pushing the president to deport a Turkish Muslim cleric -- a prize sought by Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who saw the man as an enemy of his regime. Mr. Giuliani called the claim that he was lobbying on that issue ""stupid"" and untrue. Still, for a short time, his access to the Oval Office was curbed.He got paid to promote an ethane-methane deal in Uzbekistan. His security consultancy signed contracts with the government of Bahrain and a Ukrainian-Russian developer. Other work included engagements with governments, groups, individuals and causes in Romania, Iran, Brazil and Venezuela.Trying to dazzle a woman on a date, he took her to a reception on the rooftop of the Hay Adams Hotel thrown by a lobbyist for the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Congolese, who were hoping to get America to back off sanctions, wanted his advice on how to please the Trump administration.He seemed taken aback when reporters questioned him about his private business clients. ""I'm not going to answer any more of your goddamn questions because this is getting to be harassment,"" he said in an interview last month.One of those clients had cost him big dollars.When he announced that he would be representing Mr. Trump, he said he would be taking a leave of absence from Greenberg Traurig. But his partners, and some of their clients, had had their fill of being associated with Mr. Trump. The firm said Mr. Giuliani was resigning. He said it was a mutual decision.The loss of the $6 million income came with one consolation. No longer would Mr. Giuliani be subject to a moratorium on his TV appearances, imposed by the firm's buttoned-down reticence. ""The last year and a half, I haven't been on television,"" Mr. Giuliani said in May 2018. ""Frankly, I've missed it.""He returned to the airwaves with mesmerizing announcements and claims. Contradicting Mr. Trump, he said the president had indeed reimbursed one of his former lawyers, Michael Cohen, for the hush money paid to a pornographic film actress who said she had had a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. A typical errand for a lawyer, he averred, though many begged to differ.Mr. Giuliani denounced F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors investigating the president and Mr. Cohen as thugs, storm troopers, bumbling. (Mr. Cohen, now in prison for his role in the hush-money scheme, said the investigators who raided his office had been polite; when he turned against Mr. Trump, he was declared a ""scumbag"" by Mr. Giuliani.)Other lawyers on the Trump team were dismayed by his rhetoric, but Mr. Giuliani said it was tactical, regardless of how unhinged it seemed. Once he learned that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, had decided that Justice Department policy forbade the criminal indictment of a sitting president, he said, he viewed impeachment as Mr. Trump's only risk. That would be a public relations war, not a legal one, he explained, with the battles fought on television -- an arena that Mr. Mueller did not contest. During his barrage, public opinion shifted slightly against an impeachment based on the Mueller findings, and Congress showed little appetite for pursuing it. Mr. Giuliani took victory laps.With scant attention at first, he shifted the theater of combat away from television screens, and into murky Ukraine politics.The UkrainiansWithout Mr. Giuliani's push for money and frank yearning for relevance, the Trump Ukrainian initiative might never have amounted to much more than presidential tweetstorms. Mr. Giuliani compressed the digital gases of the president's suspicions and wishful theories into what is now the molten core of impeachment.Nothing shows how few limits Mr. Giuliani observed as plainly as his extended bear-hugs of Lev Parnas or Igor Fruman, his friends, clients and fellow emissaries for the president of the United States -- the men he brought to his 9/11 dinner at the Maloney & Porcelli steakhouse in Manhattan.In just about every snapshot from their travels, and there are many, Mr. Giuliani has a big grin on his face when he poses with Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, two Florida men who were trying to hustle up business in Ukraine for an energy company they had just created.They are simultaneously minor characters in the impeachment saga and very telling ones.Mr. Giuliani may have been stopped from becoming secretary of state in 2017 by his business entanglements, but as Mr. Trump's personal lawyer in 2019, he created and oversaw the dominant American foreign-policy channel with Ukraine, running the president's affairs, his clients' and his own through it.That brought Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman into the president's wake, sea gulls following an ocean liner.When they met Mr. Giuliani last year, Mr. Parnas, born in Ukraine, and Mr. Fruman, a native of Belarus, were on the prowl for influence to help their companies, and over time would plow about $700,000 into political campaigns.Mr. Fruman also had a business distributing luxury products in Ukraine, including yachts, jewelry, cars and electronics.Mr. Parnas's résumé includes work for companies that sold penny stocks in New York, a string of evictions and lawsuits in Florida and a judgment, now approaching $700,000, owed to an investor in a film project. He started a company called Fraud Guarantee, to provide due diligence services for investors. Like other business ventures of his, it was a bust. But it managed to pay $500,000 to Mr. Giuliani, who served as godfather for Mr. Parnas's newborn son and attended the bris in Boca Raton, Fla.The three men enjoyed private dinners in Washington, Florida, New York. Trips to Paris, Warsaw, Madrid. At a Yankee game in London, Mr. Giuliani, sporting one of the four diamond-encrusted World Series rings he'd gotten from the team, ushered them onto the field and into the dugout.Mr. Giuliani opened doors for them, and they reciprocated at an opportune moment.Late last year, Mr. Giuliani began to pursue information in Ukraine that he believed might show that the Mueller inquiry was built on a false premise, that it was really Ukrainians who meddled in the election and then framed the Russians for it.This had long been the claim of Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, now serving seven and a half years in federal prison for laundering millions of dollars from the Russia-aligned political party in Ukraine.Mr. Manafort maintained that he and Mr. Trump were victims of Ukrainian meddling that took two forms: the release of a mysterious slush fund ledger that detailed payments by the Russia-aligned party, including $12.7 million earmarked for Mr. Manafort; and the hacking of Democratic National Committee computers that was blamed on Russia.""The original investigation came to me from an investigator who had a client who said that the Ukrainians were the ones who did the hacking,"" Mr. Giuliani said in April. In addition, he said, he was told that the release of the ledger was a malignant act by Ukrainian forces hostile to Mr. Trump -- and that it might be a forgery.So, he said, he had a duty to Mr. Trump to run it down.""I think if I didn't do it, I wouldn't be a good lawyer,"" Mr. Giuliani said.Far more than a lawyer serving a client in a legal matter, though, Mr. Giuliani continued his Ukraine project long after Mr. Trump was clear of any jeopardy from the Mueller investigation, which ended in March.Pinning the 2016 cyberattacks on Ukraine was a steep hill to climb, as the Senate Intelligence Committee had unequivocally found that they were a Russian operation. Even so, Mr. Giuliani demanded that the country's new president announce an investigation of it, according to Gordon Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union.Equally difficult would be showing that Mr. Manafort was a victim of a forged paper ledger: Electronic bank records were so overwhelming that he pleaded guilty.Nevertheless, if blame were seen to have shifted to Ukraine in these episodes, Mr. Giuliani would provide balm for Mr. Trump's lingering furies that the findings of Russian involvement had tainted his presidency. Debunking the slush-fund ledger could also help build the case for a pardon of Mr. Manafort, Mr. Giuliani said.Enter Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, guides in Mr. Giuliani's search for vindication of assorted conspiracy theories.They connected Mr. Giuliani to a former prosecutor in Ukraine who added another twist to the plot. He claimed that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had forced his removal because Mr. Biden's son, Hunter Biden, had been given a lucrative, little-show position by an oligarch who wanted the prosecutor out. Proving this would be yet another steep hill to climb, as the prosecutor's record was so dismal that his dismissal was also sought by the European Union, the International Monetary Fund, the G7 and Ukrainians who protested his actions.Still, Mr. Giuliani's project expanded from Mr. Manafort to include the vilification of Mr. Biden and yet one more person: the American ambassador in Kyiv, Marie Yovanovitch.The ambassador, an advocate for reforms in the Ukrainian energy sector, testified that she believed Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman saw her as an obstacle to their business plans. Mr. Parnas assured people -- prophetically -- that she would be removed in short order.Mr. Giuliani fed claims about the ambassador and Mr. Biden to a writer at The Hill, bundled articles and memos into folders from Trump hotels and sent it all to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a big White House envelope. Though the charges against the ambassador were decried by the State Department as fabrications, they were amplified on Twitter by Donald Trump Jr. She was abruptly ordered home.Phone records show that Mr. Giuliani was in frequent touch with the White House during this time, including with a regular caller identified only as ""-1,"" who Congressional investigators suspect may be the president.Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman also dangled American favors in front of Petro O. Poroshenko, president of Ukraine at the time, and two exiled Ukrainian oligarchs facing legal problems in the United States. In exchange, the oligarchs and the president were asked for their help in implicating the Bidens in bribery, or Ukraine in 2016 meddling.In August, Mr. Giuliani met in Madrid with an adviser to Volodymyr Zelensky, the new Ukrainian president, and also told Mr. Sondland, the ambassador, that he wanted the Ukrainians to announce investigations. As Mr. Giuliani knew from experience, such an announcement at the right moment can be as lethal as a poison arrow, needing only to break the skin to do its damage.By fall, as a whistle-blower's complaint brought the pressure campaign into the light, the foundations of Mr. Giuliani's work were crumbling. An ally of Mr. Giuliani said he saw no evidence that Vice President Biden or his son had broken Ukrainian law.Mr. Giuliani himself publicly conceded in a Sept. 29 interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos that there was no evidence that Ukraine had hacked the Democratic computers, and said that he had never actively investigated it.A few days before, he had appeared on CNN.""Did you ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?"" asked Chris Cuomo, the host.""No,"" Mr. Giuliani replied. ""I actually didn't.""He held that position for 27 seconds. Mr. Cuomo followed up, ""So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?""""Of course I did,"" Mr. Giuliani replied.His project to deliver a crushing blow against a Trump opponent, and to establish that Mr. Trump -- not the Democrats -- had been the victim of foreign interference in the 2016 election, would fade into a toxic fog of impeachment charges.At the same time, The New York Times reported that contrary to Mr. Giuliani's claim that he had no business interests in Ukraine, he had negotiated with officials there for up to $500,000 in contracts that would involve the recovery of looted assets.And during an August trip to Spain, Mr. Giuliani also did business unrelated to Ukraine: He met with a Venezuelan oligarch facing legal troubles from federal prosecutors in Florida, as The Washington Post reported. (One month later, as The Times reported, Mr. Giuliani held a high-level meeting on the man's case with Justice Department officials in Washington.)Mr. Giuliani and his two friends got together for lunch on Oct. 9, at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, the company cafeteria of Trump-world, where hamburgers go for $26 and the least expensive shots of Macallan are $29.All three were heading to Vienna -- Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman that very evening, Mr. Giuliani the next night. One of their sources, the unhappy ex-prosecutor, was going to be interviewed there by Sean Hannity, the Fox News personality.They probably did not know that this would turn out to be their last get-together, at least for a while.That evening, as they waited to board their Vienna flight, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman were arrested on charges of making illegal campaign contributions -- in part, prosecutors charge, to influence the removal of the ambassador.Few people could have been more astonished at Mr. Parnas's access to the halls of power and prestige than those who say they were bilked or stiffed by him. A lawyer, Robert J. Hantman, represents a creditor with a judgment against Mr. Parnas.""It's unbelievable that these people would be in the White House, or be hanging out with Giuliani,"" Mr. Hantman said. ""For Giuliani, the president, or anyone who wants to work with him to not have googled him, it's unreal.""In a world with few boundaries or limits, it was very real.Full-Time HeroMr. Giuliani was far from a Lone Ranger in the Ukraine pressure campaign. Top figures in the administration knew of it or worked with him. ""Everyone was in the loop,"" Mr. Sondland testified.But it was Mr. Giuliani who served as the wrangler of business hustlers, compromised ex-prosecutors, Ukrainian oligarchs and a host of bewildered American diplomats and Ukrainian elected officials who could not entirely fathom how he had come to wield such outsize influence, or to what ends he was wielding it.And what of his relationship going forward with Mr. Trump, who effortlessly throws people under the bus? In October, the president praised Mr. Sondland on Twitter as a ""really good man and great American."" When the ambassador testified last month that he had been acting on the president's orders in pressuring Ukraine, Mr. Trump said: ""I don't know him very well. I have not spoken to him much.""After signs of distance between the president and Mr. Giuliani -- when the president hesitated about confirming that he was still his personal lawyer, Mr. Giuliani made a ""joke"" to The Guardian about having ""very, very good insurance"" -- Mr. Trump gushed praise for him on Twitter and on ""Fox and Friends.""Mr. Giuliani said he appreciated the show of support, but added: ""I'm not some little schmuck that needs Daddy to protect him.""The Rudolph W. Giuliani business has been hurt, he said, because potential clients are afraid of being exposed to the endless scrutiny of his affairs.His need for money shows no sign of ebbing. In addition to his domestic cash burdens, Mr. Giuliani is now said to be under investigation by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. He has hired a team of lawyers to represent him. Legal fees could approach seven figures.Reports indicate that the prosecutors are looking at his compliance with restrictions on lobbying. ""I don't do lobbying, goddamn it,"" Mr. Giuliani said, scoffing at the possibility of criminal charges. Although he negotiated with Ukrainian officials about representing them, and carried their messages to American officials and journalists, they ultimately did not come to any agreement, he said.""I represented the president of the United States,"" Mr. Giuliani said. ""It is totally ridiculous to say that I was representing anyone else.""Anthony Carbonetti, a City Hall aide to Mr. Giuliani and a longtime friend, said he worried that what he saw as Mr. Giuliani's groundbreaking years as New York mayor would be forgotten behind the sky-filling spectacle of Mr. Trump.""The fact that this is what he'll be known for is painful,"" Mr. Carbonetti said. ""His public persona has been dominated by his representation of the president for the last two years, so that has become the public perception of him. I don't think anyone goes back in time.""Whatever his friends' misgivings, Mr. Giuliani remains sure as ever that he is in the right.His mission, he maintained, uncovered ""one of our more major scandals."" Evidence against the Bidens is in his safe, he wrote on Twitter, adding, ""If I disappear, it will appear immediately.""Just last week, The Times reported, he returned to Ukraine to create television programs for a conservative network that he believes will show that he is right and House Democrats are wrong. Mr. Trump said on Saturday that Mr. Giuliani wanted to tell Congress what he had found.So far, Mr. Giuliani has declined to testify, and described the impeachment hearings on Twitter as an ""attempted coup takedown.""The story, then, is being left to the people who survived being buried alive by Mr. Giuliani, including the cashiered Ambassador Yovanovitch.""How is it that foreign corrupt interests could manipulate our government?"" she asked in her testimony.The face Mr. Giuliani sees in the mirror, he has always said, is of a man compelled by his idealism to purify government. ""I get completely disgusted when I see public corruption,"" he said.Anyone who sees something else in him is mistaken, he said.""I really try very hard to be super-ethical and always legal,"" Mr. Giuliani said. ""If it seems I'm not -- it's wrong, and I can explain it.""As for how he will be viewed in the future, he has, at times, professed indifference. But in an interview with The Atlantic, Mr. Giuliani predicted that he would emerge from all the investigations wreathed in glory, an indispensable man who served the country against the odds.""These morons,"" Mr. Giuliani said. ""When this is over, I will be the hero.""PhotographRudolph W. Giuliani, then mayor of New York, with Donald J. Trump in 1999. The two have known each other for decades.

| Jump to first hitIn September, an obscure Twitter account promoting a fringe belief about an anti-Trump cabal within the government tweeted out a hashtag: #FakeWhistleblower.It was typical for the anonymous account, which traffics in far-right content and a conspiracy theory known as QAnon, some of whose adherents think that satanic pedophiles control the ""deep state."" The Federal Bureau of Investigation recently labeled QAnon a potential domestic terror threat.Still, that did not stop others, including a Republican congressional candidate, from quickly picking up the hashtag and tweeting it. Within a week, hundreds of QAnon believers and ""MAGA"" activists had joined in, posting memes and bogus reports to undermine the complaint by a government whistle-blower that President Trump had pressed Ukraine's leader for dirt on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son.Then Mr. Trump tweeted the hashtag himself.Such is the frenetic life cycle of conspiracy-driven propaganda, fakery and hate in the age of the first Twitter presidency. Mr. Trump, whose own tweets have warned of deep-state plots against him, accused the House speaker of treason and labeled Republican critics ""human scum,"" has helped spread a culture of suspicion and distrust of facts into the political mainstream.The president is also awash in an often toxic torrent that sluices into his Twitter account -- roughly 1,000 tweets per minute, many intended for his eyes. Tweets that tag his handle, @realDonaldTrump, can be found with hashtags like #HitlerDidNothingWrong, #IslamIsSatanism and #WhiteGenocide. While filters can block offensive material, the president clearly sees some of it, because he dips into the frothing currents and serves up noxious bits to the rest of the world.By retweeting suspect accounts, seemingly without regard for their identity or motives, he has lent credibility to white nationalists, anti-Muslim bigots and obscure QAnon adherents like VB Nationalist, an anonymous account that has promoted a hoax about top Democrats worshiping the Devil and engaging in child sex trafficking.""I've been retweeted by the President of the United States, President Trump!"" replied VB Nationalist, who gained thousands of followers after the high-level boost and took it as a sign of encouragement, adding, ""Tell me again, how he doesn't care about us.""To assess this unprecedented moment, The New York Times examined Mr. Trump's interactions with Twitter since he took office, reviewing each of his more than 11,000 tweets and the hundreds of accounts he has retweeted, tracking the ways he is exposed to information and replicating what he is likely to see on the platform. The result, including new data analysis and previously unreported details, offers the most comprehensive view yet of a virtual world in which the president spends significant time mingling with extremists, impostors and spies.Fake accounts tied to intelligence services in China, Iran and Russia had directed thousands of tweets at Mr. Trump, according to a Times analysis of propaganda accounts suspended by Twitter. Iranian operatives tweeted anti-Semitic tropes, saying that Mr. Trump was ""being controlled"" by global Zionists, and that pulling out of the Iran nuclear treaty would benefit North Korea. Russian accounts tagged the president more than 30,000 times, including in supportive tweets about the Mexican border wall and his hectoring of black football players. Mr. Trump even retweeted a phony Russian account that said, ""We love you, Mr. President!""In fact, Mr. Trump has retweeted at least 145 unverified accounts that have pushed conspiracy or fringe content, including more than two dozen that have since been suspended by Twitter. Tinfoil-hat types and racists celebrate when Mr. Trump shares something they promote. After he tweeted his support for white farmers in South Africa, replies included ""DONALD IS KING!"" and ""No black man can develop land.""The president gets some of his questionable material on Twitter from the 47 accounts he follows that show up in his feed, a curated timeline of tweets that come mostly from his family, celebrities, Fox News hosts and Republican politicians, some of whom in turn follow Twitter accounts that promote QAnon or express anti-Islam or white nationalist views.QAnon-related accounts have potentially migrated to the president's iPhone courtesy of retweets by Donald Trump Jr., the Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo and the conservative commentator Eric Bolling, all of whom Mr. Trump follows. The younger Mr. Trump has also retweeted Russian intelligence operatives pushing divisive stories about immigration and voter fraud.Trolls and fringe elements quickly figured out that the best way to reach Mr. Trump is to appeal to his ego. Last year, an anonymous account with a profile photo of the actor Kurt Russell and posts promoting QAnon tagged Mr. Trump in a tweet, declaring, ""You're the greatest President of my lifetime, Sir."" It was not really Mr. Russell, but Mr. Trump retweeted it with a ""Thank you!,"" helping the account add 2,900 followers that day, before Twitter eventually suspended it.Authentic or not, the most fervent MAGA and QAnon accounts -- at least 23,000 of his followers have QAnon references in their profiles -- form a dependable Greek chorus that exploits the tricks of the medium to amplify the president's message. Mr. Trump benefits from the activism of his online supporters and the platform's algorithms, which tend to reward the most partisan content within digital communities.But the constant exposure to the worst elements of social media poses risks. Clint Watts, a former F.B.I. agent and a cybersecurity expert who studies propaganda campaigns on social media, said the time Mr. Trump spent on Twitter ""gives you an amazing opportunity to game the president.""""You are very clearly capable of using Twitter to entice and influence this president,"" he said. ""You can distort the guy's views from your house.""Since the dawn of the internet, the nation's leaders have been largely sheltered from the storm of disinformation and bile that churns on its fringes. Social media barely existed during Bill Clinton's presidency, George W. Bush's reference to ""the Google"" betrayed his unfamiliarity and Barack Obama chafed at being denied an iPhone but agreed to it.But with the arrival of Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, Twitter managed to connect the ultimate seat of power to the darkest corners of the web for the first time. There is little evidence that Mr. Trump harbors concerns about promoting accounts that traffic in fake or inflammatory material.The White House declined to comment for this article and turned down an interview request with the president. But at a White House ""social media summit"" in July that brought together far-right activists and provocateurs, Mr. Trump expressed appreciation for the fodder he sampled on Twitter.""The crap that you think of,"" he said, ""is unbelievable.""Mastering the CraftThe path to #FakeWhistleblower stretches back to a seminal conspiracy theory in Trump World: #FakeBirthCertificate.Mr. Trump's campaign to sow doubts about Mr. Obama's birthplace, as he was considering running for president himself in 2012, showcased his talent for propagating a useful lie. It also overlapped with his growing presence on Twitter.When his account was created in 2009, the three-year-old platform was just beginning to extend its reach beyond a community of journalists, techies and other early adopters. Over time, as high-profile public figures joined and Twitter allowed for longer messages, its influence grew as a forum for people to comment in real time about live events, world leaders to make official pronouncements and celebrities to interact with fans. Twitter said earlier this year that it had 126 million daily active users.For Mr. Trump, a Twitter account quickly proved useful for promoting himself, sounding off about politics and, eventually, amplifying his attacks on Mr. Obama. By the time he started tweeting the birther smear in November 2011, his fans had already been doing the same, creating memes and hashtags like #FakeBirthCertificate, first used for that purpose in April 2011 by a supporter who cited Mr. Trump in the tweet.After Mr. Trump started tweeting on his own in early 2013 -- he previously had help from an assistant -- he was soon recycling misinformation. He retweeted an anti-Obama account that had tweeted at him, ""The birth certificate that you forced Obama to show is a computer generated forgery."" And he spun conspiracies within conspiracies, tweeting: ""How amazing, the State Health Director who verified copies of Obama's 'birth certificate' died in plane crash today. All others lived.""Mr. Trump's experience using Mr. Obama as a punching bag made him adept at weaponizing what he found on Twitter when he decided to run for president. As his following grew, so did his ability to give prominence to objectionable material and -- intentionally or not -- those responsible for it.In early 2016, he twice retweeted an obscure white supremacist account, @WhiteGenocideTM, that had directed a tweet at him ridiculing Jeb Bush, an opponent in the Republican primary. The since-suspended account, which regularly posted neo-Nazi propaganda and listed its location as ""Jewmerica,"" gained hundreds of followers in the days after Mr. Trump's retweets.By the time he faced off against Hillary Clinton, a perfect storm had coalesced on a more polarized and partisan Twitter -- bringing together activists and trolls practiced at spreading conspiracy theories and hate, and Russian intelligence operatives seeking to foment discord. A how-to manual titled ""Advanced Meme Warfare"" circulated online with instructions for creating material to help the Trump campaign by trashing the Clintons.""The idea is to stack up so much doubt, emotional appeals, and circumstantial evidence ON TOP of facts that we create a landslide of anti-Hill sentiment that permeates through society,"" it said.As memes ricocheted around Twitter, Mr. Trump frequently retweeted them and made use of hashtags like #CrookedHillary. After he won the election, Mr. Trump was asked if he would continue being combative on Twitter once he settled into the White House. In an interview with ""60 Minutes,"" he defended his tweeting as ""nothing you should be ashamed of,"" but pledged to change his tone as president.""I'm going to do very restrained, if I use it at all,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I'm going to do very restrained.""Dark UndercurrentsThe implications of Mr. Trump's Twitter habit became apparent early in his presidency. In short order, he was railing about ""fake news,"" questioning the findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and peddling the fiction that millions of illegal ballots had cost him the popular vote.Beyond his own tweets, the president stepped up his practice of retweeting others, sharing anti-Muslim videos posted by a British far-right figure who had been retweeted by Ann Coulter. (He later stopped following Ms. Coulter after she criticized him for not making progress on the Mexican border wall.)That episode highlighted one of the ways the president sees information on Twitter. His feed regularly contains tweets from his son, Donald Jr., who follows and retweets alt-right figures like Stefan Molyneux, a Canadian who pushes ""white genocide"" conspiracy theories and has promoted white nationalists on his YouTube channel.The younger Mr. Trump has also followed Lauren Southern, another Canadian right-wing activist who has promoted the ""great replacement"" theory that white populations are being overrun by nonwhite immigrants with the help of global elites. In May, the president retweeted a post in which she complained that far-right voices were being suspended on social media.Six people the president follows -- including Dan Scavino, the White House social media director -- in turn follow Terrence K. Williams, a comedian who has been retweeted by Mr. Trump frequently. Among the retweets was a phony smear claiming that a Muslim congresswoman had partied on the anniversary of Sept. 11, and a conspiracy theory linking the Clintons to the suicide of the imprisoned sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Beyond the people he follows, there is another potential pathway to the president on Twitter -- his ""mentions,"" the surging stream of tweets and replies that are directed at him by tagging his handle.Fake accounts that Twitter identified as being run by foreign intelligence agencies have made frequent use of this tactic to try to get his attention: Russian accounts targeted Mr. Trump with tweets making the false assertion that Russia did not hack the Democratic National Committee's emails. A Chinese account directed a tweet at him calling CNN ""goofy commies."" And an Iranian account heckled him, saying, ""Every morning that American people wakeup, they are nervous about your new tweets.""The odds of his seeing a tagged post amid the deluge are slim, in part because Twitter's algorithms try to screen out objectionable material and his account may employ filters. Some of his Twitter activity is also managed by Mr. Scavino. Still, Mr. Trump spends time looking at tweets that mention him or hashtags that interest him.The content he chooses to retweet is similar to his own: mostly partisan attacks and praise for himself, with occasional inflammatory material mixed in. While it is not always clear whether his retweets are intended to endorse their authors, the president is effectively launching those accounts into the public eye.On St. Patrick's Day last March, while awaiting the conclusion of the Mueller report, Mr. Trump went on a daylong Twitter tirade, batting out more than 30 tweets that appear to have come from extended immersion in the streams flowing through his account.The morning dawned with a 6:01 a.m. barb from Donald Trump Jr. -- ""So many stains on the #GhostofJohnMcCain"" -- presaging several tweets from the president an hour later attacking the deceased senator over old grudges. At the same time, amid a rapidly building flood of mentions, there was a plea directed at him to ""reverse the replacement"" of white people, a tweet from an account with an anti-Semitic name demanding Fox News undo the suspension of the host Jeanine Pirro for anti-Muslim comments, and hundreds of references to QAnon.The president shared a conspiracy-minded post by William Craddick, a right-wing writer who peddled the ""pizzagate"" hoax that Democratic politicians secretly ran a child-trafficking ring out of a Washington pizzeria. ""Russiagate,"" Mr. Craddick wrote, ""was designed in part to help the UK counter Russian influence by baiting the United States into taking a hard line against them."" And Mr. Trump sent out a tweet by Jack Posobiec, another pizzagate promoter, linking to a news story about Latino gang members stabbing and burning a teenager.By nightfall, Mr. Trump had retweeted an obscure QAnon follower who, a few weeks earlier, had pushed the Democratic-pedophilia smear. His retweet of that account -- whose profile image is a stylized ""Q"" wearing a red MAGA hat -- drew notice on the online message boards of 4chan, which were abuzz with speculation that the president had tacitly approved of QAnon theories.The binge ended at 9 p.m., when Mr. Trump tweeted, ""MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""Promoting ConspiraciesQAnon entered the public consciousness in October 2017, when someone using the code name ""Q"" began posting on 4chan, claiming to have secret knowledge of a conspiracy within a Democrat-controlled ""deep state"" to oust Mr. Trump in a coup.According to Q's groundless theory, Mr. Trump was aware of the plot and was quietly working to unravel it with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, using the Russia investigation as a cover to sweep up the perpetrators through mass arrests. The most extreme adherents of what became known as QAnon -- short for ""Q Anonymous"" -- also postulate that the deep state is part of a global network of corrupt elites involved in Satanism, pedophilia and cannibalism.Remarkably, this conspiracy would migrate from the dark fringes of social media and into conservative political circles, where it took root among a segment of Mr. Trump's most fervent supporters. People holding Q signs have shown up at Trump rallies, and the ""Q"" symbol found its way into a ""Women for Trump"" 2020 campaign video.Last year, two QAnon disciples were arrested in separate episodes, and in May the F.B.I. included QAnon in an intelligence bulletin warning of potential violence stemming from ""anti-government, identity-based and fringe political conspiracy theories,"" particularly as the 2020 election approaches.There are few places where QAnon's visibility has been greater than on Twitter, where Mr. Trump has helped propagate it. Although Mr. Trump does not follow any QAnon-related accounts, some in his Twitter circle do.Bill Mitchell, a conservative podcaster who promotes QAnon, is followed by nine people whom the president follows and has potentially appeared in his feed more than a dozen times. The president has frequently retweeted him, including one post advancing the discredited suggestion that Mr. Obama wiretapped Mr. Trump's phones in 2016.In an email to the Times, Mr. Mitchell said he considered the president's retweets ""a hat-tip without an overt endorsement."" He believes that the president is deliberately provocative on Twitter to keep political enemies off balance and unable to ""think strategically,"" he said.""Through his tweets, President Trump keeps the Democrats and media in a perpetually heightened emotional state, in this case offense and anger,"" he wrote, adding that he respected QAnon's leaders as ""patriots and Trump supporters.""More than 50 accounts that have QAnon references in their profiles -- and dozens more that do not but also promote the conspiracy -- appeared among those followed by Donald Trump Jr.; Ms. Bartiromo; Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee; Katrina Pierson, a Trump campaign adviser; Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio; and a handful of others who are all, in turn, followed by the president.There is no indication that these people, who collectively follow thousands of accounts, are aware of the QAnon presence that lurks there, much less support it.But the potential for QAnon accounts to appear in the presidential feed underscores the viral nature of disinformation on Twitter, where a tweet can hatch on the fringes, hopscotch through layers of accounts and, aided by hashtags and bots, gain wide currency.On Thursday evening, a QAnon promoter tweeted an unsubstantiated yarn that years ago he overheard a key witness in the impeachment inquiry bad-mouthing America and talking up ""Obama & globalism."" QAnon accounts passed it around, and by the next morning it had been retweeted by Mr. Posobiec, who in turn was retweeted by Donald Trump Jr. -- in less than 24 hours, the story had wormed its way into the president's Twitter circle.And it has happened before. During a busy Sunday morning of tweeting in August, Ms. Bartiromo retweeted an anonymous account called @QBlueSkyQ that had posted a series of conspiratorial messages about the Russia investigation, along with a video snippet of her Fox interview with George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign aide arrested in the scandal.Even a glance at @QBlueSkyQ's profile would have revealed that it was a die-hard QAnon account. It has tweeted doctored images and fake memes promoting a falsehood that top Democrats sexually torture children to harvest adrenochrome -- a chemical derived from adrenaline -- for a life-extending elixir. The @QBlueSkyQ retweet was one of at least a half-dozen times Ms. Bartiromo helped circulate such accounts, though none of the posts dealt with the QAnon conspiracy directly. Ms. Bartiromo declined to comment.QAnon accounts have also been retweeted by Mr. Bolling, a former Fox News commentator. Mr. Bolling said that he had no idea any account he retweeted was connected to QAnon, and that it was unfair to expect him to ""vet every account that I retweet.""""I wouldn't have done it had I known,"" he said. ""I have nothing to do with QAnon.""Mr. Bolling retweeted an anonymous QAnon account called @K12Lioness several times, most of it partisan political material and all unrelated to the Q conspiracy. But in between the run-of-the-mill tweets that caught his attention, the account was also pumping out vile memes and messages from the deepest fringes of the QAnon universe, like this post in June:""The Democrats have lost their minds (adrenochrome) eating baby parts. MY GOD Americans WAKE UP!!""Deploying the TrollsMr. Trump was two weeks from his inauguration in January 2017 when he tweeted, ""So how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers?""It would be the start of a relentless campaign, continuing to the present, to dispute that the Russians interfered in the 2016 election. Eventually, the narrative would merge with another -- that Mr. Biden intervened in Ukraine to protect his son's business interests -- in the now-infamous phone call in which Mr. Trump pressed Ukraine's president to search for the D.N.C.'s email server, implying without evidence that it was somewhere in his country.That effort began within days of Mr. Biden's official campaign announcement in April, when a Trump supporter tweeted a meme of Mr. Biden with the words, ""China & Ukraine, Quid Pro Joe."" The post prompted another Trump fan to put a hashtag to use: #QuidProJoe. The #QuidProJoe and #FakeWhistleblower hashtags had both been created years earlier for issues unrelated to Mr. Biden and Ukraine, but were dusted off and put into service by Trump supporters.The #QuidProJoe hashtag remained relatively dormant until a few weeks later, when it was retweeted seven times by a pro-Trump, bot-like account that cranks out more than 100 tweets a day, including QAnon and fervent anti-Democratic material. The hashtag steadily gained currency, and by September, when news erupted of the whistle-blower complaint filed a month earlier, it was part of a growing arsenal of social media tools seized on by Mr. Trump's supporters, including Donald Jr.A slew of hashtags -- nearly all of them created by anonymous, unverified accounts, some connected to QAnon -- have been deployed on Twitter in recent months attacking the impeachment inquiry, and in particular Representative Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who leads the House Intelligence Committee. Many have crude names, like #LyingSackOfSchiff, #SchiffForBrains and #FullOfSchiff.So far, none of those hashtags has gotten a presidential tweet. But every day, Mr. Trump offers his Twitter fans reason for hope.On Oct. 19, between tweeting ""Shifty Schiff is Corrupt"" and retweeting an anonymous account that regularly traffics in alt-right and Russian propaganda, the president tweeted out a fresh hashtag being pushed by his supporters: #StopTheCoup.Twitter went wild.The New York Times reviewed every tweet and retweet sent by President Trump from Jan. 20, 2017, through Oct. 15, 2019. Retweets include those with and without comment. The Times reviewed each account retweeted by Mr. Trump and determined whether the account was verified or not. The Times then evaluated the unverified accounts to determine whether they had been suspended by Twitter or had tweeted conspiracy theories.Sources: Trump Twitter Archive, Internet Archive, YouGov, RussiaTweets.com, PolitwoopsThis is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.Credit: By MIKE McINTIRE, KAREN YOURISH and LARRY BUCHANAN; Rich Harris contributed reporting.

| Jump to first hitDespite Ms. Warren's upward momentum in polls and fund-raising, she lacks the support of a single governor, big-city mayor or fellow senator outside Massachusetts.WASHINGTON -- Senator Elizabeth Warren has built her following in part by taking pictures with thousands of voters deep into evening after campaign events, but her dinner audience here one night last month was far smaller. And Ms. Warren's guests were more interested in hearing, and politely challenging, her campaign pitch than eagerly capturing the moment for posterity on their iPhones.Addressing a few dozen members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus at a Chinese restaurant a few blocks from the Capitol, she laid out her case for why she could unify Democrats, emphasized that she was not hostile to properly run businesses and made a soft sell to the lawmakers to support her presidential bid.""She said, 'Nobody could do this alone, I will need your help,""' recalled Representative Chellie Pingree of Maine, who attended the gathering and said Ms. Warren ""was great.""But just under a month since the family-style meal, the Massachusetts senator has the same small number of endorsements from congressional colleagues beyond her home state as she did beforehand: three.Ms. Warren is expected to reveal additional support from Democratic officials this week in conjunction with Tuesday's CNN/New York Times debate and the release of her smashing third-quarter financial disclosure. Yet her growing crowd sizes, soaring fund-raising and surge to the top of a number of national and early-state polls only shine a brighter light on one of the most revealing elements of this primary: the widening gap between the preferences of many Democratic voters and the lawmakers who represent them.Ms. Warren is now a clear front-runner in the race for her party's nomination, yet just under four months before the leadoff Iowa caucuses she lacks the support of a single governor, big-city mayor or fellow senator outside Massachusetts.She does have the backing of the Working Families Party, an influential liberal group, and yet she also has fewer total endorsements from state legislators in Iowa and New Hampshire than Senator Cory Booker, who registers in the lower single-digits of surveys and last month had to beseech donors to give him enough money to sustain his stagnant campaign.The apparent lag between Democratic activists and Democratic elected officials, which comes nearly four years after President Trump's stunning outsider's capture of the Republican nomination and Senator Bernie Sanders' surprisingly potent candidacy in the Democratic primaries, has done little to slow Ms. Warren's momentum.Yet the reluctance of Democratic lawmakers to embrace Ms. Warren's campaign this deep into the year, after she has plainly emerged as a leading candidate, illustrates both the lingering reservations party elites have about her general election prospects and her unique positioning in this race.""Racing to the left is not really speaking to the needs of people in the heartland,"" said Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who expressed alarm about scrapping private health insurance, urged the candidates to focus on ""pocketbook issues"" and, when asked if Ms. Warren could reclaim the Midwestern states Mr. Trump captured in 2016, paused before saying: ""I'm not sure.""Ms. Warren is politically neither fish nor fowl.She is not an anti-establishment insurgent in the style of Mr. Sanders, who were he in the position Ms. Warren is now would almost certainly have inspired a Stop Bernie campaign funded by a petrified donor class. But with her refusal to raise money among rich contributors, her unabashed populism and her pre-Senate roots in academia, she is hardly a Clinton-style creature of the Democratic political class.As a result, many party officials are neither rushing to oppose her nor racing to her side, instead staying on the sidelines and doing what politicians often do when they are uncertain of what choice to make: buying time.""It's easier to wait, you keep your relationships good,"" said Representative Deb Haaland of New Mexico, one of the few lawmakers who is supporting Ms. Warren, noting that some of her colleagues are loath to offend their friends in the race by choosing a candidate.Reinforcing this instinct toward caution is the fluid nature of a primary still large enough to feature 12 candidates on the debate stage this week as well as the high stakes of next year's general election.""You had two candidates last time,"" said longtime Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, referring to the Sanders-versus-Hillary Clinton race. ""People want to see this unfold.""Thanks to his decades-long relationships and the perception in some quarters that he would be a strong candidate against Mr. Trump, Joseph R. Biden Jr. has picked up the most support from Democratic lawmakers of any of the presidential hopefuls. But his uneven performance as a candidate this year and Mr. Trump's daily barrage of attacks on him have left some party officials wondering just how safe a pick he is in 2020.""People are concerned about Joe, but they ask: Is Elizabeth electable?"" said former Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, explaining the dilemma. ""So a lot of people are just keeping their powder dry because they have not decided who can best run against Trump.""Defeating a president who may be the first incumbent to seek re-election after being impeached should be the party's overriding focus, said Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois.""I genuinely feel our republic is in danger,"" Mr. Pritzker said.A longtime donor who often immersed himself in primaries before he entered politics, Mr. Pritzker said he was staying out of this race for the time being in part because he was still stung by 2016, when some of Mr. Sanders's supporters protested what they saw as his mistreatment by Mrs. Clinton and her establishment-aligned supporters.""When he didn't win people folded their arms and stayed home or they voted for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson,"" said Mr. Pritzker, alluding to two of the third-party candidates whose votes helped cost Mrs. Clinton the election.He's not the only Democrat who has the echo of the Sanders-Clinton race still throbbing in their ears nor the only one determined to avoid alienating any of the supporters of this cycle's candidates.""Many believed the primary was rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton,"" Representative Darren Soto of Florida said. ""There is a feeling among many of us that we need to have a broad and diverse field, plenty of debates and let the primary voters decide on their own.""What few lawmakers will say, at least publicly, is that wading into the race can also come with a cost: they run the risk of angering the eventual nominee if they support a losing candidate and they also invite complaints from their own constituents or donors, who may have a different preference.What's more, they also have to be mindful of their own political branding and how they align themselves.""Politicians are different from voters,"" said Donna Brazile, the longtime Democratic strategist and former party chair. ""They have to say, 'How does this fit with my agenda, my district?""' In Ms. Warren's case, even one of her biggest boosters, Ms. Haaland, conceded it was easier for her to step out early because of the progressive nature of her district.""Some folks they're just like, 'I better stay out of it for a while because of my district,""' she said of her House colleagues.And it's not just lawmakers who are taking a wait-and-see approach. Powerful liberal interest groups, including much of organized labor, are also hanging back, which only prompts the politicians to believe it's safer to remain mum.""That would make a difference if they came out,"" Representative Dina Titus of Nevada said of unions. ""They're all being coy, too.""Ms. Titus said she planned to get behind a candidate later this year, but her state, the third to vote in next year's primary, illustrates just how many party elites were remaining neutral: Nevada's governor, two senators, three Democratic House members and longtime boss, former Senator Harry Reid, have all refrained from endorsing a candidate.Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland said that he had also been ""drawn in different directions in this race,"" noting that he wanted to make a decision that's both ""passionate and strategic.""But after having lunch in Washington last month with Ms. Warren and her husband, Bruce Mann, Mr. Raskin said he planned on endorsing the senator.""If all she had to her name was senator from Massachusetts she would not be an ideal candidate,"" he said, before citing Ms. Warren's record as a consumer advocate and critic of Washington self-dealing. ""As a candidate of public integrity and honesty in government, she has a very powerful story to tell at a time of boundless Republican corruption and lawlessness."" What's more, Mr. Raskin said, ""She made a very eloquent and personal pitch to me.""As for Ms. Pingree, she said she was ""watching the wisdom, the perspective of the public"" and was eager ""to see who people get excited about.""She will also have a chance to gauge the views of her colleagues. When Congress comes back from its recess this week, Ms. Pingree said she and the other House Democrats who live in her Washington high rise planned on having a debate watch party in the building's common room.PhotographSenator Elizabeth Warren is now a clear front-runner in the race for her party's nomination, yet she lacks the support of a single governor, big-city mayor or fellow senator outside Massachusetts.

| Jump to first hitWho is John Solomon? His name popped up frequently in closed-door testimony in the impeachment query. He is a regular on Hannity. And his work helps shape how millions of Americans understand this moment.WASHINGTON -- In weeks of closed-door testimony, American officials who worked in Ukraine kept circling back to the work of one journalist, John Solomon, whose articles they said appeared to have considerable currency with President Trump's inner circle.They had never known Mr. Solomon to be an authority on Ukrainian politics before, and certainly not someone with particular insights into the American ambassador to Ukraine who was a frequent target of his. So when Rudolph W. Giuliani, Donald Trump Jr. and the president himself started talking about his stories, those officials began closely following what he wrote.Asked how she first learned of Mr. Giuliani's interest in Ukraine, Fiona Hill, Mr. Trump's former adviser on Russia and Europe, replied, in part, ""John Solomon.""Mr. Solomon has been a surprisingly central figure in the impeachment proceedings so far. But the glare has not been so kind.One witness testified to Congress that an article of his was full of ""non-truths and non sequiturs."" Another witness said that he could not recall a single thing that was correct in one of Mr. Solomon's stories, then added sarcastically, ""His grammar might have been right.""So who exactly is John Solomon? A Washington-based reporter and Fox News personality who had until recently been working at the politics outlet The Hill, Mr. Solomon, 52, is not well known outside conservative media. But, according to interviews and testimony, his writing and commentary helped trigger the chain of events that are now the subject of the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump.Though he worked for years at The Associated Press and briefly at The Washington Post, he moved on from mainstream outlets and now sits at the center of a network of conservative journalists, radio hosts, cable news pundits and activists whose work reaches millions of Americans every day, and shapes the way a large swath of the country sees this pivotal moment.Understanding their work is key to explaining how Mr. Trump's approval ratings remain so durable with his base -- and why, as some polls suggest, far more direct and damaging evidence would have to emerge from the impeachment hearings that begin their public phase on Wednesday for that support to crack.According to transcripts released last week, Mr. Solomon and his pieces for The Hill are a focus for congressional investigators as they look into Mr. Trump's efforts to push Ukrainian officials to investigate his rivals. One particular area of interest for Democrats, the transcripts show, is Mr. Solomon's role in advancing claims by Mr. Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his family deserved to be investigated for their own dealings in Ukraine.In an interview, Mr. Giuliani said he turned to Mr. Solomon earlier this year with a cache of information he believed contained damaging details about Mr. Biden, his son, Hunter Biden, and the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.""I really turned my stuff over to John Solomon,"" Mr. Giuliani said. ""I had no other choice,"" he added, asserting that Obama-era officials still ""infected"" the Justice Department and wouldn't have diligently investigated the information he had compiled.""So I said here's the way to do it -- I'm going to give it to the watchdogs of integrity, the fourth estate,"" he said.'The Woodward and Bernsteins of our time'Mr. Solomon's work has been endorsed by some of the most influential figures on the right like Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and the president, who has highlighted Mr. Solomon's articles on Twitter.Mark Levin, the radio and Fox host, recently said that Mr. Solomon and Sara Carter, a journalist with whom he frequently appears on television, were ""like the Woodward and Bernsteins of our time.""Media scholars describe the environment that has elevated Mr. Solomon's stories as an information ecosystem entirely sealed off from other news coverage.Nicole Hemmer, a historian at Columbia University who studies the conservative media, said people often mistakenly refer to the Fox News-talk radio world as an ""echo chamber"" of opinion when in fact it is more like ""an interconnected set of authorities.""""Sean Hannity talks about John Solomon,"" she said, ""and then that gets picked up on Rush and Levin."" The effect, she added, is that his reporting carries weight with conservative audiences. ""That gives it an authority when they're hearing it from multiple sources every day.""When Mr. Solomon appears on television and the radio, Mr. Hannity and other conservative hosts often identify him as an investigative reporter and cite his decades of experience at news organizations like The A.P. But his critics see this as a sleight of hand to give his writing a veneer of nonpartisan objectivity.""Part of the issue is that for years he was identified with the mainstream media,"" said James Manley, a former aide to Harry Reid, the former Senate majority leader who tangled with Mr. Solomon in the 2000s over stories insinuating Mr. Reid had benefited inappropriately from his office. The Columbia Journalism Review later singled out Mr. Solomon's reporting, saying it was ""much ado about very little.""An examination of Mr. Solomon's reporting methods and interviews with people who have worked with him during his decades-long career in Washington, show that his techniques blur the boundaries meant to keep journalist-source relationships at an arm's length. And for some of his biggest stories on Ukraine, he has relied on a prosecutor with a history of making inconsistent statements who is now under criminal investigation.At one point while he was employed as a columnist for The Hill and publishing regular pieces favorable to the president, Mr. Solomon discussed with colleagues a proposal to create a transparency office in the Trump White House. Some colleagues believed he might have wanted to run this office, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation.(Unlike Fox, The Hill put a disclaimer over Mr. Solomon's writing indicating that it was opinion starting in May of 2018 after complaints from colleagues about what they saw as one-sidedness in his work, The Post reported at the time.)Mr. Solomon denied that he has ever sought work in any administration and said the transparency office proposal had ""nothing to do with seeking a job."" He added, ""It had to do with fostering an idea for more transparency."" As for the attacks on his work from the impeachment witnesses, he said, ""The N.S.C. and State officials are entitled to their opinions of my reporting.""A close look at one piece by Mr. Solomon shows how far one of his assertions, later called into doubt, can reverberate at the highest levels of the government.In late March, Mr. Solomon and his team published pieces in The Hill making sensational claims of misconduct at the State Department: The American ambassador to Ukraine, a career foreign service officer who assumed her post during the Obama administration, had privately bad-mouthed Mr. Trump and, separately, had previously provided to Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's prosecutor general at the time, a list of individuals that Mr. Lutsenko should not prosecute. In conservative circles, where suspicion of anti-Trump officials working inside the government runs high, the allegation fit with the narrative that institutions like the State Department are rife with bad actors.But there was less to the do-not-prosecute list than it appeared. The State Department dismissed it as ""an outright fabrication."" Mr. Lutsenko changed his story and acknowledged that what he is quoted describing in Mr. Solomon's report -- ""a list of people whom we should not prosecute"" given to him by the ambassador -- did not actually exist.In an interview with The New York Times last month, Mr. Lutsenko blamed the confusion on the interpreter who handled his interview with The Hill. But he insisted that the ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, had in fact asked him not to target certain politicians and activists who worked with the embassy on its anti-corruption efforts.But among Mr. Trump's allies and media boosters, the story line was set: A corrupt ambassador who did not like the president was misusing her authority to protect her friends. In the whistle-blower complaint that set off the impeachment inquiry, those articles and others by Mr. Solomon are cited as among the key events leading up to Mr. Trump's demand that the Ukranians do him ""a favor"" and investigate the Bidens.Mr. Solomon said in an email that Mr. Lutsenko was adamant he had not changed his story when the two spoke for a follow-up interview. The back-and-forth over the existence of a formal list, he said, is a ""classic he-said, she-said dispute,"" which he believes his coverage accurately reflected. ""The idea I should have some regret for accurately quoting a major news figure in Ukraine is preposterous,"" he said.The ""don't prosecute"" story gained considerable traction in conservative media. It drew the attention of the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who in March tweeted that Ms. Yovanovitch, was a ""joker"" who shouldn't be in the job. In May, the Trump administration recalled her from her position.In his testimony, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, seemed alarmed at how quickly Mr. Solomon's story was amplified by high-profile figures like Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump's son. He testified that the entire thing ""smelled really rotten.""'Reporting truth' with unusual methodsMr. Solomon grew up in Connecticut where his father was a police officer and later served as chief of police for the town of Easton. Before working for conservative outlets, he held senior reporting jobs at a number of mainstream organizations, including The A.P., where he worked for almost 20 years, and The Post, where he pursued investigative projects that often focused on federal law enforcement.Mr. Solomon won an award in 2002 for coordinating the A.P.'s investigations into the law enforcement failures that preceded the Sept. 11 attacks. He joined The Post in 2007 but stayed only a short period before leaving for the Washington Times, telling his bosses that he could not pass up the large salary the conservative paper was offering.His work at The Hill since 2017 has generated the most notice and controversy of his career. His reporting was of considerable value to the outlet's publisher, James Finkelstein, who has been friends with Mr. Trump for decades and saw Mr. Solomon as a high-profile hire whose frequent Fox News appearances could help generate buzz and traffic for the website.While Mr. Solomon was at The Hill, his relationships with sources were sometimes closer than reporters typically get with the people they cover. In March, according to documents uncovered as part of the impeachment inquiry, he shared a draft of one of his stories before publication with a noteworthy group: people who had helped gather the information that Mr. Giuliani had provided to Mr. Solomon.They included Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova, two lawyers who have been working with Mr. Giuliani to undermine the investigations into Mr. Trump, and Lev Parnas, a Ukrainian-American businessman who helped connect Mr. Giuliani to Mr. Lutsenko. Mr. Solomon said ""I do go over stories in advance"" with sources for accuracy, not to tip them off to the content.Mr. Solomon left The Hill in September under circumstances that neither he nor the paper have fully described. He has not said what his new venture will be -- or how it is being funded -- other than to describe it to former colleagues as a media start-up. For the time being, he is publishing his work on his personal website. His slogan is ""Reporting Truth.""Michael Schwirtz contributed reporting.

| Jump to first hitNo Democrat in modern times has won the party's nomination without claiming majorities of black voters, the most crucial voting bloc in South Carolina and an array of delegate-rich states.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has 154 endorsements from current or former black or Hispanic elected officials. Senator Kamala Harris has 93. Senator Bernie Sanders has 91. Senator Cory Booker has 50. Senator Elizabeth Warren has 43.Mayor Pete Buttigieg has six.The South Bend, Ind., mayor has surged to first place in some Iowa polls and has built a big-money fund-raising operation that is the strongest in the Democratic presidential field.But as his campaign has grown exponentially beyond the small band of loyalists who began it in January, Mr. Buttigieg has failed to demonstrate even minimal support among African-Americans and Hispanics, critical voting blocs that will have a much larger say after Iowa and New Hampshire, and their nearly all-white electorates, begin the presidential nominating calendar.On Wednesday night, debate moderators questioned Mr. Buttigieg's record on racial issues while rivals including Mr. Booker, of New Jersey, and Ms. Harris, of California, suggested he needed on-the-job training in talking to black audiences.Mr. Buttigieg's weakness with voters of color -- he registered zero percent among black South Carolina Democrats in a Quinnipiac University poll released Monday -- limits his potential in the 2020 campaign. A donor-class favorite who draws capacity crowds across Iowa, Mr. Buttigieg counts as his highest-profile black supporter either the man who lost a 2018 election to be Florida's attorney general or the former mayor of Kansas City, Mo.No Democrat in modern times has won the party's nomination without claiming majorities of black voters, the most crucial voting bloc in South Carolina and in an array of delegate-rich Southern states.""He needs to get out into the communities and countryside and let people know who he is,"" said Sly James, the former Kansas City mayor, who endorsed Mr. Buttigieg in September. ""That means some travel to the South, more time and exposure there and finding some key African-American leaders who can open doors for him and endorse him.""Mr. Buttigieg's supporters say most black voters and politicians haven't gotten to know him and predicted that, once they do, his fortunes will improve.""Many voters, including those in the black community, are just starting to learn who Pete is and hear his story and his vision for the country,"" said Kevin Johnson, an African-American renewable energy executive from Chicago who is bundling donations to the Buttigieg campaign. ""As people get to know him, he quickly captures their attention and trust.""For now, Mr. Buttigieg has so few black elected officials and former elected officials backing him that they could all fit into a single S.U.V. The issue emerged during a meeting he held this summer with Congressional Black Caucus members who pressed him about why he did not have black officials from South Bend vouching for him on the campaign trail.Of the black elected officials and former elected officials who have endorsed him, only Sean Shaw, a former one-term Florida state representative who lost his statewide race last year, has been to South Carolina on his behalf.Mr. Buttigieg has far more help from surrogates on the fund-raising circuit.Since Oct. 1, his campaign has held fund-raisers or donor gatherings with at least 13 separate campaign surrogates, including the actress Mandy Moore and the tech entrepreneur Matt Rogers, who co-founded the Nest home security company and is married to Swati Mylavarapu, the chairwoman of Mr. Buttigieg's fund-raising apparatus.Mr. Buttigieg has acknowledged his weakness with voters of color when he's been asked about it along the campaign trail. He and his supporters have argued for months that he will start doing better among black voters once they learn more about him and his plans.Win Iowa, this plan goes, and he'll win attention and perhaps support from black voters that has so far gone to Mr. Biden.""I welcome the challenge of connecting with black voters in America who don't yet know me,"" Mr. Buttigieg said during Wednesday's debate. ""As mayor of a city that is racially diverse and largely low income, for eight years I have lived and breathed the successes and struggles of a community where far too many people live with the consequences of racial inequity that has built up over centuries but been compounded by policies and decisions from within living memory.""Mr. Buttigieg took only light jabs from his opponents on issues of race during the debate. Ms. Harris passed on a chance to repeat criticisms of him she made last weekend. Mr. Booker said that he had a full understanding of issues concerning black voters.""I have a lifetime of experience with black voters,"" Mr. Booker said. ""I've been one since I was 18. Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters.""Since his campaign was sidetracked in June by the fatal shooting of a black man by a white South Bend police officer, which illuminated his failure to hire African-American police officers, Mr. Buttigieg's campaign has been dogged by a series of episodes that have brewed distrust among black voters.He returned a $5,600 campaign contribution last month from a lawyer who had sought to block the release of video of a Chicago police officer shooting Laquan McDonald, a black teenager, 16 times, killing him. Last week two black South Carolinians rescinded their support of Mr. Buttigieg's ""Douglass Plan"" for black economic empowerment after his campaign included their names on a list of supporters. Another, who initially expressed surprise that her name was included, later endorsed the plan, though not Mr. Buttigieg's campaign.His campaign later apologized for using a stock photograph from Kenya to illustrate the plan online.And on Sunday Mr. Buttigieg's husband, Chasten, was widely mocked for a tweet that contained a photograph of him with Ms. Moore and a nearly all-white crowd in heavily black New Orleans.More attacks on Mr. Buttigieg's record on race are coming. Our Revolution, a political organization backing Mr. Sanders, is planning a Dec. 7 rally in South Bend that will highlight Mr. Buttigieg's handling of the June police shooting and feature a black South Bend Common Council member aggrieved that two of her properties were razed by Mr. Buttigieg's municipal government.""When you can't even take care of the needs of black folks in your own city, I don't think you are in any position to be the president of the United States of America,"" Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator who is a national co-chairwoman of the Sanders campaign, said at a Sanders campaign fund-raiser Tuesday in Atlanta.As his campaign took flight, Mr. Buttigieg was not always as responsive to inquiries from black officials as they would have liked.Cordelia Lewis-Burks, a Democratic National Committee member from Indianapolis, said that shortly after Mr. Buttigieg announced his exploratory committee in January, she asked him to speak at a dinner celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Indianapolis chapter of the N.A.A.C.P.Weeks later she had received no response. In April, a Buttigieg campaign staff member called and invited her to his official campaign launch in South Bend.""I said, 'You've got to be kidding me. I've been trying to get the mayor to be the speaker for two months,""' Ms. Lewis-Burks said. Twenty minutes later, she said, she got word that Mr. Buttigieg would indeed speak at the N.A.A.C.P. dinner, which he did in October.A Buttigieg aide said the campaign was not aware of the invitation until after his formal campaign launch.Prominent black and Hispanic Democrats say they know few, if any, people of color who are supporting Mr. Buttigieg. Marc Morial, the former New Orleans mayor who is president of the National Urban League, said he knew of no one. Henry R. Muñoz III, a former treasurer of the Democratic National Committee, said he knew of just one Latina donor.Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, a super PAC, said her organization had conducted focus groups of a few dozen black voters in six cities since August. In straw polls of the focus group participants, Mr. Buttigieg has not received a single vote.""The missteps that get into the press, the South Carolina thing and the thing with the photograph, those are problematic because they become part of the narrative around him,"" Ms. Shropshire said. ""They become data points on this ongoing narrative about his inability to attract black voters.""Even in Iowa, where Mr. Buttigieg opened a nine-point lead over the field in the latest Des Moines Register poll, the enthusiasm for his candidacy is not shared by the state's small black and Latino community. Paula Martinez, a member of the Iowa Democratic Party's state central committee and co-chairwoman of the state's Brown & Black Forum, said she didn't know of any black or Hispanic Iowans who supported Mr. Buttigieg.""For African-American voters, familiarity and trust is extremely important because of the tendency and habits of politicians to say one thing and do another,"" Mr. Morial said. ""Sometimes there's a reluctance to follow a new face who has no record of delivering.""Black officials who have endorsed Mr. Buttigieg said they thought he had time in the three months before the Feb. 29 South Carolina primary to build a relationship with African-American voters.Mr. Shaw, the former Florida lawmaker, said he planned to make more campaign trips to South Carolina for Mr. Buttigieg.""The African-American community has a very long-term relationship with Joe Biden and it's going to take some doing to get at that,"" Mr. Shaw said. ""But there are a lot of candidates who need to be doing better in African-American communities.""Lamont Robinson, an Illinois state representative, said he talks up Mr. Buttigieg to constituents in Chicago, but he hasn't come across any other black officials who back him.""We have to be able to focus in on a comprehensive plan for the African-American community and that's in the Douglass Plan,"" Mr. Robinson said. ""Surrogates like myself, we're working toward getting that plan out to people.""And Mark Barbee, the first black mayor of Bridgeport, Pa., is, like Mr. Buttigieg, an openly gay millennial mayor. He endorsed Mr. Buttigieg in September and said the 2020 campaign was too unpredictable to write off Mr. Buttigieg's ability to win over black voters.""We're in an age where anything can happen,"" said Mr. Barbee, who leads a community of about 4,600 people. ""Pete Buttigieg could drop a song with Beyoncé tomorrow and change the game. You just never know!""PhotographMayor Pete Buttigieg appeared at Morehouse College in Atlanta on Monday, above, and attracted a nearly all-white audience on Oct. 26 at the Rock Hill City Hall Amphitheater in South Carolina, where blacks are a key Democratic bloc.

| Jump to first hitAfter ending the third quarter with less cash than four rivals, Joe Biden's campaign reversed course to stop discouraging supporters from forming a super PAC to help him in the Democratic primary.Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s campaign effectively dropped its longstanding opposition to receiving the assistance of super PACs on Thursday, opening the door for wealthy supporters to spend unlimited amounts of money to try and lift him in the Democratic primary.The move represents a stark reversal and an implicit acknowledgment of his weakened position in the contest. He entered October with only $9 million in the bank, a fraction of his leading rivals.Mr. Biden had explicitly denounced support from a super PAC in his 2020 run and had previously said he would not have blessed one if he had run in 2016. As recently as a month ago, when a possible pro-Biden super PAC surfaced, his campaign denounced the effort.But on Thursday, Kate Bedingfield, his deputy campaign manager, softened that stance, blaming the barrage of ads and attacks from President Trump and his allies and accusing them of interfering in the Democratic primary.""Let's be clear: Donald Trump has decided that the general election has already begun,"" Ms. Bedingfield said. ""He and his allies are already spending massive amounts of money on paid television and digital advertising to intervene directly in Democratic primaries with the goal of preventing Joe Biden, the opponent that Trump fears most, from becoming the Democratic nominee.""She said Mr. Biden maintained his desire to remove private money from federal campaigns but ""nothing changes unless we defeat Donald Trump.""Faiz Shakir, the campaign manager for Senator Bernie Sanders, immediately criticized the flip.""The former vice president has been unable to generate grass roots support, and now his campaign is endorsing an effort to buy the primary through a super PAC that can rake in unlimited cash from billionaires and corporations,"" Mr. Shakir said.During a town hall-style event in Marshalltown, Iowa, on Thursday evening, Mr. Sanders laced into Mr. Biden further. ""Well, Joe Biden didn't have to convince me not to start a super PAC,"" he said, in response to a question from an audience member about Mr. Biden telling Mr. Sanders during his 2016 campaign run that he didn't need to start a super PAC.Mr. Sanders later added: ""I don't need a super PAC. I am not going to be controlled by a handful of wealthy people. I will be controlled by the working people of this country.""Mr. Biden himself had framed his opposition to super PACs around the ability to appeal to middle-class Americans. ""I've said it before and I'll say it again. To speak to the middle class, we need to reject the super PAC system,"" he wrote on Twitter in April.The Biden campaign had maintained its anti-super PAC posture in late September even as Mr. Trump's attacks were underway, citing it as a matter of principle.""The attacks aimed at this campaign from dark money groups helping Donald Trump spread his outlandish lies and slander have only served as a reminder of the urgent need for campaign finance reform,"" T.J. Ducklo, a Biden spokesman, said then. ""Which is exactly why since the beginning of this campaign, Biden for President has not and will not welcome the help of super PACs.""While the Biden campaign statement on Thursday did not explicitly embrace a super PAC, Tiffany Muller, the president of End Citizens United, which opposes big money in politics, said that Biden campaign staff confirmed that Mr. Biden was dropping his opposition to a super PAC.""It is incredibly disappointing to see Vice President Biden completely reverse his position now that times are tough,"" Ms. Muller said. ""I don't think we could say it as well as he did when he said, 'People can't possibly trust you' if you accept support from a super PAC.""'Officials involved in the pro-Biden super PAC discussions a month ago had included Larry Rasky, a former aide to Mr. Biden, Mark Riddle, a political strategist, and Philip Munger, a prominent Democratic donor.""We intend to fight back against the lies and distortions we're seeing now from Trump, his allies, the Russians, and the Republican Party,"" Mr. Rasky said. ""While other candidates have groups supporting their efforts, no other Democrat has to fight this two-front war. We know Joe Biden is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump -- and so does Donald Trump.""The Democrats planning the pro-Biden super PAC, which include Julianna Smoot, a former top fund-raiser for Barack Obama, have also contacted Steve Schale, a Florida-based strategist, about playing a key role, according to party officials familiar with the conversations.Jonathan Martin, Alexander Burns and Sydney Ember contributed reporting.PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitHouse Democrats sent a subpoena to the White House requesting a vast range of documents about President Trump's dealings with Ukraine and efforts to cover up his actions.WASHINGTON -- House impeachment investigators widened the reach of their inquiry on Friday, subpoenaing the White House for a vast trove of documents and requesting more from Vice President Mike Pence to better understand President Trump's attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.The subpoena, addressed to Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, calls for documents and communications that are highly delicate and would typically be subject in almost any White House to claims of executive privilege. If handed over by the Oct. 18 deadline, the records could provide keys to understanding what transpired between the two countries and what steps, if any, the White House has taken to cover it up.The request for records from a sitting vice president is unusual in its own right, and Mr. Pence's office quickly signaled he may not comply. In a letter to Mr. Pence, the chairmen of three House committees conducting the impeachment inquiry wrote that they were interested in ""any role you may have played"" in conveying Mr. Trump's views to Ukraine. They asked for a lengthy list of documents detailing the administration's dealings with Ukraine, to be produced by Oct. 15.The actions came at the end of another day of fast-moving developments in the House impeachment investigation, which is centered on allegations that Mr. Trump and his administration worked to bend America's diplomatic apparatus for his own political benefit.Mr. Trump himself appeared resigned to the prospect that he would be impeached, and was gearing up for an epic political battle to defend himself, predicting the Democrat-led House would approve articles of impeachment against him and the Republican-controlled Senate would acquit him.""They'll just get their people,"" he said of House Democrats. ""They're all in line. Because even though many of them don't want to vote, they have no choice. They have to follow their leadership. And then we'll get it to the Senate, and we're going to win.""Privately, Mr. Trump briefly joined a conference call of House Republicans, defending his interactions with Ukraine and rallying his party to fight for him.On Capitol Hill, the impeachment investigation continued gaining steam, as requests and information from witnesses began to stack up. For more than six hours on Friday, the House Intelligence Committee questioned the intelligence community's independent watchdog who first fielded a whistle-blower complaint that has spurred the formal impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community inspector general, had received the complaint and explained his own preliminary investigation into its validity before seeking to deliver it to Congress.""What the inspector general said last time was, the whistle-blower pulled the fire alarm,"" Representative Mike Quigley, Democrat of Illinois, told reporters. ""We have now seen the smoke and the fire.""How the White House, which has routinely rejected congressional requests for information, responds to the demands for documents could significantly shape the impeachment investigation going forward. Under normal circumstances, the White House could claim materials referred to in both requests were privileged, using that as a defense in court.Press secretaries for the White House and the vice president issued similar statements assailing the demands, but did not clearly indicate whether they would comply or not. Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said the subpoena ""changes nothing"" and called it ""just more document requests, wasted time and taxpayer dollars that will ultimately show the president did nothing wrong.""Katie Waldman, Mr. Pence's press secretary, promptly said that ""given the scope, it does not appear to be a serious request but just another attempt by the 'Do Nothing Democrats' to call attention to their partisan impeachment.""But that will not help Mr. Trump's case on Capitol Hill. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the chairmen leading the inquiry have consistently warned the White House that noncompliance with their requests will be viewed as obstruction of Congress, itself a potentially impeachable offense.""The White House has refused to engage with -- or even respond to -- multiple requests for documents from our Committees on a voluntary basis,"" said the letter to Mr. Mulvaney, signed by Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the Intelligence Committee chairman; Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, the Foreign Affairs Committee chairman; and Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the Oversight and Reform Committee chairman. ""After nearly a month of stonewalling, it appears clear that the president has chosen the path of defiance, obstruction, and cover-up.""In addition to the new subpoena and request, a significant subpoena deadline for the State Department to hand over similar material in its possession was also scheduled to arrive by the end of the day. The State Department missed the deadline, a House official said late Friday, but department officials were in contact with the committees and lawmakers were still hopeful they would cooperate soon.Even as they worked, lawmakers from both parties continued Friday morning to try to make sense of a tranche of texts between American diplomats and a top aide to the Ukrainian president. Those messages were released late Thursday night, and called into question the truthfulness of Mr. Trump's claim that there had been no quid pro quo attached to his pressing Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., his son and other Democrats.The House committees are scheduled to interview additional witnesses implicated in the texts next week. Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union and a Trump supporter who been actively involved in diplomacy with Ukraine, is expected to appear on Tuesday, and Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former American ambassador to Ukraine, on Friday.Democrats have pounced on the texts as further evidence that Mr. Trump was treating the investigations as a precondition to giving Ukraine, an American ally that borders Russia, a meeting with the president and a $391 million package of security aid. Most Republicans remained silent or stood by Mr. Trump in light of the new messages, but a few raised alarms.Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, one of the few members of Mr. Trump's party who have been critical of the conduct at the center of the impeachment inquiry, issued a statement condemning the president's public comments on Thursday in which he invited China as well as Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.""When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China's investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,"" Mr. Romney said. ""By all appearances, the president's brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.""Democrats on Capitol Hill said Mr. Atkinson's account reinforced the seriousness of their effort.A Trump appointee, Mr. Atkinson helped set off the current saga less than a month ago when he notified Congress's intelligence committees that he had received an anonymous whistle-blower complaint that he deemed to be ""urgent"" and credible. The acting director of national intelligence intervened initially to block Mr. Atkinson from sharing the complaint with Congress, but ultimately the Trump administration relented and allowed its public release.In the complaint, the whistle-blower wrote that multiple government officials had provided him information that ""the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.""Specifically, he said that Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, had pressed Ukraine to conduct the investigations, potentially using the prospect of a meeting that the new Ukrainian president badly wanted with Mr. Trump and withholding the aid earmarked for the country as leverage to secure the investigations. The White House tried to cover up aspects of the events, the complaint said.Mr. Atkinson has already appeared once before the House Intelligence Committee, but he was barred then from speaking in detail about the complaint. On Friday, Mr. Atkinson walked lawmakers through the complaint and some of the steps he took to try to evaluate the veracity of his claims, including showing documents. The inspector general declined to share with the committee names of officials he spoke during his brief investigation, according to one person familiar with his testimony.Details of the complaint, including a July call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, have already been verified. The texts released late Thursday also appeared to comport with elements of the complaint.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, and Annie Karni from Washington.PhotographPresident Trump appeared resigned to the prospect he would be impeached, and was gearing up for a political battle to defend himself.

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump made a similar, but private, request of the president of Ukraine, an episode that has prompted an impeachment inquiry.WASHINGTON -- President Trump, already facing impeachment for pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, publicly called on China on Thursday to examine former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as well, an extraordinary request for help from a foreign power that could benefit him in next year's election.""China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,"" Mr. Trump told reporters as he left the White House to travel to Florida. His request came just moments after he discussed upcoming trade talks with China and said that ""if they don't do what we want, we have tremendous power.""The president's call for Chinese intervention means that Mr. Trump and his attorney general have now solicited assistance in discrediting the president's political opponents from Ukraine, Australia, Italy and, according to one report, Britain. In speaking so publicly on Thursday, a defiant Mr. Trump pushed back against critics who have called such requests an abuse of power, essentially arguing that there was nothing wrong with seeking foreign help to fight corruption.Throughout his presidency, Mr. Trump has made little effort to hide actions or statements that critics called outrageous violations of norms and standards. And yet because he does them in public, they seem to stir less blowback than if they had been done behind closed doors. Among other things, he repeatedly called on his own Justice Department to investigate his Democratic foes and eventually fired his first attorney general for not protecting him from the Russia investigation.By boldly repeating the action at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, Mr. Trump almost appeared to dare House Democrats to impeach him. But he left his own party in an increasingly uncomfortable position. Republican lawmakers largely stayed silent on Thursday, neither criticizing the president's latest comments nor defending them as they nervously awaited other developments that they worried could change the complexion of the case.Mr. Trump's comments on China came as the first witness was interviewed by House investigators as part of the impeachment inquiry into the president's request for investigations into Mr. Biden, a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, and other Democrats during a July 25 phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine at the same time Mr. Trump was withholding $391 million in American aid.During a daylong, closed interview, Kurt D. Volker, who resigned last week as the Trump administration's special envoy to Ukraine, told House staff members about his interactions with the Ukrainians and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, who has been vigorously lobbying for Ukrainian investigations into Democrats.Mr. Trump's comments on Thursday set off a wave of criticism from Democrats, who said he brazenly implicated himself.""What Donald Trump just said on the South Lawn of the White House was this election's equivalent of his infamous 'Russia, if you're listening' moment from 2016 -- a grotesque choice of lies over truth and self over the country,"" Kate Bedingfield, Mr. Biden's deputy campaign manager, said in a statement.Ms. Bedingfield was referring to a news conference during the 2016 campaign when Mr. Trump on camera called on Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's email servers. ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" he said. The investigation by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III later determined that just hours later Russian hackers made their first effort to break into servers used by Mrs. Clinton's personal office.Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the House Intelligence Committee chairman leading the impeachment inquiry, said the president's latest comments were further evidence of his betrayal of duty.""The president of the United States encouraging a foreign nation to interfere and help his campaign by investigating a rival is a fundamental breach of the president's oath of office,"" he told reporters.Mrs. Clinton weighed in as well. ""Someone should inform the president that impeachable offenses committed on national television still count,"" she wrote on Twitter.Whether it is impeachable will be decided by the House, which will determine if it amounts to ""high crimes and misdemeanors,"" as outlined in the Constitution. Such a conclusion does not require a criminal offense, but some critics have argued that the president's requests for investigations of rivals violate campaign finance laws barring solicitation of foreign contributions.The Justice Department has not interpreted it that way. In fact, Attorney General William P. Barr himself has been in touch with foreign officials seeking help for an investigation into the origin of Mr. Mueller's inquiry to determine if it was generated by an illegitimate ""hoax"" undertaken for partisan reasons, as Mr. Trump has contended.But the chairwoman of the Federal Election Commission on Thursday seemed to suggest that Mr. Trump's statements might cross a legal line. Ellen L. Weintraub, a Democrat who has served on the commission since 2002, reposted a statement she made in June warning candidates that ""it is illegal for any person to solicit, accept or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election.""Sally Yates, an Obama administration holdover who served as acting attorney general until she was fired by Mr. Trump, said the president behaved as if acting in the light of day would transform corrupt actions into innocent ones. ""The president is trying to hypnotize the American people into believing that it can't be wrong if he says it out loud,"" she said.""The White House counsel in a case like this would find the nearest window and jump out,"" said Robert F. Bauer, who served as President Barack Obama's top lawyer and supports Mr. Biden. ""There's no way to defend it. No way. None.""Republicans did not even try on Thursday, and some disaffected colleagues said they should speak out against the president. ""He's asking foreign governments to interfere in our election,"" former Representative Joe Walsh of Illinois, who is waging a long-shot battle for the Republican nomination, wrote on Twitter. ""Right out in the open. Because he thinks he can get away with it. He's unfit. He's dangerous.""Left to defend himself, Mr. Trump weighed back in Thursday night, asserting he was allowed to seek foreign help. ""As the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!"" he wrote on Twitter.Mr. Trump has insisted that his July conversation with Mr. Zelensky was ""perfect"" even after a reconstructed transcript of the call released by the White House showed him imploring the newly inaugurated Ukrainian leader to ""do us a favor"" by investigating the Bidens and other Democrats shortly after Mr. Zelensky discussed his need for more American aid to counter Russian aggression.Undaunted by criticism, Mr. Trump repeated that request on Thursday morning. ""I would say that President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Because nobody has any doubt that they weren't crooked.""Even as he seeks investigations by Ukraine and China, the president and Mr. Barr have also solicited help from Australia and Italy to uncover information undermining the origin of Mr. Mueller's investigation. The Times of London has reported that Mr. Trump sought help from Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, a report that has not been denied by either the White House or the British government.In Ukraine, Mr. Biden's son Hunter made $50,000 a month on the board of an energy company. As vice president, his father pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor whose office oversaw investigations into the company's owner. But by the time the elder Mr. Biden acted, there was no public evidence that the prosecutor was actively pursuing an investigation, and no evidence has emerged that the vice president, who was carrying out Obama administration policy, was motivated by his son's business interests.In calling for an investigation of American citizens by China, a repressive Communist government with no rule of law, Mr. Trump referred to a business deal Hunter Biden was in that involved a fund drawing investment from the government-owned Bank of China. The fund was announced in late 2013, days after Hunter Biden flew to China aboard Air Force Two with the vice president, who was in the midst of a diplomatic mission.The president said on Thursday that Hunter Biden was not qualified for that business, noting that he had been discharged from the Navy Reserve after testing positive for cocaine. ""He got kicked out of the Navy,"" Mr. Trump said. ""All of a sudden he's getting billions of dollars. You know what they call that? They call that a payoff.""Mr. Trump said he had not asked President Xi Jinping for assistance. ""But it's certainly something we can start thinking about because I'm sure that President Xi does not like being under that kind of scrutiny.""Mr. Trump's suggestion came as senior Chinese officials were set to come to Washington next week for another round of trade negotiations. The two countries, locked in a trade war, are hoping to make progress toward a deal after a breakdown in talks in May, leading to an escalation of tariffs.Mr. Biden is not the only candidate in the race with a child with business in China. Mr. Trump's elder daughter, Ivanka, a senior White House adviser, has received valuable trademarks from China even after she closed her brand in 2018 because of worsening sales and questions of conflicts of interest.Nicholas Fandos, Alan Rappeport and Kenneth P. Vogel contributed reporting.PhotographPresident Trump's comments on Thursday led to a wave of criticism from Democrats, who said he had brazenly implicated himself.

| Jump to first hitAs the party reckons with the likelihood of an all-white candidate lineup for the December debate, Cory Booker and Julián Castro see fund-raising gains.DES MOINES -- Senator Cory Booker strode onstage here with a question, one that voters, activists and disgruntled members of the Democratic National Committee are also asking in the wake of Senator Kamala Harris's sudden departure from the 2020 race.In a year that began with the inauguration of the most diverse class of House Democrats, and quickly built to a barrier-breaking lineup of presidential candidates, do Democrats want an all-white slate of top-tier candidates to be the face of their party in 2020?""What message is that sending that we heralded the most diverse field in our history and now we're seeing people like her dropping out of this campaign?"" Mr. Booker asked a crowd here Thursday morning. He added that Ms. Harris left the race ""not because Iowa voters had the voice. Voters did not determine her destiny.""With Ms. Harris out and Mr. Booker, the former housing secretary Julián Castro, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and the businessman Andrew Yang yet to qualify for the December debate, and former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts too late an entry to have a real shot at that stage, the Democratic primary is facing a reckoning. In two weeks, Democrats will gather in Los Angeles for a debate that is likely to feature an entirely white roster. That is not, several candidates and prominent party members say, how the party that emphasizes diversity and fairness should want to represent itself.Some blame the rules for qualifying for the debates. The polling requirements give an advantage to candidates who can invest in extensive television advertising to get their name out. Others note, however, that the candidates of color in the 2020 field have not drawn significant support from black and Latino voters.Mr. Booker has been particularly critical of the debate criteria this week. His criticism, of course, comes at a crucial juncture for his campaign, where missing the debate stage could prove unrecoverable. And while he makes universal appeals to reform the process, Mr. Booker also likely stands to gain the most by any change in rules or bump in polling following Ms. Harris's exit.The push for a more diverse field, and to connect with black voters, is of course directly linked to Mr. Booker's campaign. He emphasizes his biography on the trail, and he spoke after the Thursday event of the pain his black family members expressed to him at feeling Ms. Harris had been held to an unfair standard.""It's really unfortunate that the party that's seeking justice and fairness and inclusion has created a set of rules that can be undermined so easily, and also rules that don't reflect ultimately what has determined outcomes here in Iowa,"" Mr. Booker said in a news conference following his speech, taking explicit issue with billionaire candidates flooding airwaves to ""juice their polling.""In his hastily arranged speech, tacked onto his four-day swing in Iowa, Mr. Booker had the crowd of more than 150 applauding his calls for a more diverse slate. He made repeated pleas for support, even instructing voters not to screen their calls when it might be a pollster on the line.""Pick up the phone and answer, please. Choose me,"" he said.Both Mr. Booker and Mr. Castro have seen an increase in fund-raising in the days since Ms. Harris left the race. The Booker campaign said that Wednesday was its biggest online fund-raising day of the race, with 11,000 new donors.Mr. Castro had his best fund-raising day in four months on Tuesday, and has pulled in roughly $360,000 in online donations since Ms. Harris dropped out. On Thursday, Mr. Castro said his campaign had reached the donor threshold for the December debate.Still, given the requirement to reach 4 percent in four national polls or 6 percent in two early-state polls, it is extremely unlikely that either Mr. Booker or Mr. Castro will make the December debate stage. Inside Democratic circles, particularly among prominent African Americans and Latinos, there is a growing sense of unease that the debate rules, set by Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, have disproportionally affected candidates of color.""We have a system designed by our own Democratic National Committee that is not in any way intended to elevate the most qualified candidate but designed to elect the person with the most money or most access to it,"" said Representative Marcia L. Fudge of Ohio, who was a supporter of Ms. Harris. ""That's why you're going to see an all white debate stage.""Some Democrats fear that an all-white debate stage later this month, or worse, an all-white final tier of candidates battling it out through months of primary contests, could undercut the party's much-touted image as a bastion of diversity in the Trump era..On Thursday, Mr. Booker focused mostly on the threat he believes the party faces if the demographics of its candidates do not reflect its voters.""This is not about one candidate,"" Mr. Booker said. ""It is about the diverse coalition that is necessary to beat Donald Trump.""Mr. Castro has been similarly critical this week.""By not having anyone of color onstage, the party loses a lot,"" he told reporters after a fund-raiser in Los Angeles on Tuesday. ""The party also loses partly the ability to inspire and excite constituencies that we need to win in November 2020 against Donald Trump. And, you know, the D.N.C. ought to do some soul searching on these thresholds.""In a call with reporters Thursday, Mr. Castro said that he was not asking for the rules to be changed before the December debate.""I don't want a handout by a rule change in the middle of the game,"" he said. ""That would be unfair to the people who are standing up there already.""But the D.N.C. is still ""making up their minds"" for January, Mr. Castro added, suggesting that it return to the standards it set earlier in the year.The grievances about who will or won't qualify for upcoming debate stages center on the result rather than the process that led to it. Mr. Perez announced the summer debate qualification thresholds in February. Party officials informed the campaigns weeks later that debate qualification requirements would rise as the campaign progressed.""Our process has resulted in more women and candidates of color participating in our primary debates than billionaires,"" said Xochitl Hinojosa, a committee spokeswoman. ""No one who has failed to reach 4 percent at this point in the race has ever gone on to be the nominee. Our debate criteria reflects this.""Leah D. Daughtry, a longtime Democratic National Committee member who sits on the party's rules committee, said she's had a number of conversations in recent days with other members about how to change the system to include more candidates of color. No one has come up with a workable solution.""I don't know how you fix it now without upsetting the apple cart,"" she said. ""But it's a problem. It's a real problem.""Some prominent Democrats say the party cannot be blamed for the failure of candidates of color to make the stage, placing responsibility on their inability to build momentum for their efforts -- particularly among black and Latino voters.A growing number of voters, especially younger black voters, have rejected the notion that mere representation equals the kind of change the Democratic base is hungry for. Polls have consistently shown the former vice president Joseph R. Biden Jr. leading among African-American voters, while Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is widely popular among Latinos.""When people make the case that the standards and requirements should be lowered so that candidates of color can make the debate, as a Latina, I find that insulting,"" said Maria Cardona, a former D.N.C. official. ""The reason why the candidates right now are the ones at the top of the polls are because these are the candidates who are getting the majority of support from, guess who, voters of color.""Some party officials dismiss the criticism of the debate criteria. Ms. Harris, they note, had qualified for the December debate but chose instead to drop out, they said.""The D.N.C. announced their rules months ago. And I think anyone who decided to run understood that the party had rules,"" said Donna Brazile, the former interim head of the committee. ""I don't know how you can blame the party for that.""That is not how Mr. Booker and Mr. Castro say they see it.Indeed, within hours of Ms. Harris's announcement on Tuesday that she was suspending her campaign, Mr. Booker went on MSNBC, saying he was ""a little angry, I have to say.""""The way this is shaping up, especially with the rules of the D.N.C., it is preferencing millionaires and billionaires and a lot of other things that do not ever translate into viability in Iowa,"" Mr. Booker said on Tuesday night.Following Ms. Harris's exit, prominent Democrats joined the growing chorus of support for Mr. Booker and Mr. Castro, not in outright endorsements of their candidacy, but for the need to continue to hear from a diverse set of candidates in the debates.""Many good candidates have qualified,"" Andrew Gillum, the former Democratic candidate for governor in Florida and a rising star in Democratic politics, wrote on Twitter. ""But our diversity is our strength & our debates must reflect that fully.""Mr. Gillum included links to donate to both Mr. Castro and Mr. Booker's campaigns. Several other high profile Democrats made similar pleas on social media, leading to some surge of small-dollar support for both candidates.Mr. Booker, who is set to barnstorm Iowa for the next several days, praised the state on Tuesday as the one who selected Barack Obama and set the path for the first black president.The people who turned out to hear Mr. Booker speak on Thursday morning seemed to agree with his argument.""I think the Democratic Party has really screwed this thing up,"" said Brendan Comito, 52, of Des Moines, who said candidates he's supported in the past, like John Kerry and Barack Obama, were down in the polls at this point but went on to win. ""I think they're knocking people out too early and they're not leaving the best candidates around.""Mr. Booker directed these future Iowa caucus goers to ignore the outside forces shaping the primary field.""I want you to know that we are a nation right now that has an election to decide,"" Mr. Booker said. ""And Iowa, do not let anybody else decide it for you.""He continued: ""When you hear people say it's the most important election of our lifetimes, turn around and tell them: 'Act like it.""'Reid J. Epstein contributed reporting from Washington.PhotographSenator Cory Booker, above, and former Secretary Julián Castro, below, haven't qualified for the next debate, though both reported fund-raising spikes since Senator Kamala Harris dropped out.

| Jump to first hitI get it: Your attention span has been consumed by impeachment news all week. But important stuff is happening in the business and tech worlds, too. Here's what you should know heading into Monday.______What's Up? (Oct. 6-12)The Court of Social MediaWhat role will big tech play in the Trump impeachment inquiry? We got a taste last week when President Trump's re-election campaign ran an ad on Facebook that claimed that Joe Biden had offered Ukraine $1 billion to scuttle an investigation of his son. Mr. Biden's campaign said the video (and Facebook, by extension) was peddling false information, as did a chorus of news outlets including CNN, which refused to air the ad. But when the Biden camp requested that the ad be removed, Facebook declined, claiming that it did not violate company policy. The platform's response set a laissez-faire tone toward the spread of misinformation about the impeachment inquiry -- scary, considering the impact of social media on public opinion.The N.B.A. vs. ChinaTensions between the United States and China plagued yet another industry last week: the N.B.A. An exhibition game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets, held in Shanghai on Thursday, was supposed to symbolize common ground between the two countries. (Hey, we all like basketball -- maybe our governments can agree on other things, too!) But the N.B.A.'s multibillion-dollar relationship with China became another lightning rod for conflict when an executive at the Houston Rockets tweeted his support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Chinese television networks dropped the game and some ticket holders boycotted it. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump announced that officials from the two countries had reached a ""phase one"" trade agreement that would halt the next round of tariff increases on Chinese goods, which were set to go into effect on Tuesday. The deal provides a temporary détente in a yearlong trade war.More Troubles at Victoria's SecretOnce famous for defining female sexiness (cleavage, minimal body fat, salivating men), the largest lingerie company in the United States has had a long fall in the #MeToo era. The brand laid off 15 percent of its staff last week -- an unusual move for a retailer heading into the holiday season, but these are unusual times. Sales have sagged for years as consumers' underwear tastes shifted toward more inclusive, body-positive brands. And it certainly didn't help that Victoria's Secret has been caught up in the Jeffrey Epstein sex-trafficking scandal ever since Lesley Wexner, the chief executive of the store's parent company, was revealed as one of Mr. Epstein's biggest financial clients and closest associates.______What's Next? (Oct. 13-19)Lights Out, CaliforniaIn an effort to prevent a repeat of last year's devastating wildfires, California's largest utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, shut down power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses in the northern part of the state last week. Citing dry conditions and extreme winds that could damage power lines and spark flames, PG&E said the blackouts could last several more days while electrical equipment is inspected. The economic fallout from the power cuts could be huge, but most residents would rather be safe than sorry -- especially as fires have already displaced over 100,000 people in the Los Angeles area.Brexit Careens OnRemember when Brexit's Oct. 31 deadline seemed ages away, giving Parliament plenty of time to sort out its differences with the European Union and create a sound plan for Britain's withdrawal? Well. Unless an 11th-hour agreement is reached, Britain will need to extend the deadline once more. Which worked so well the previous times, right? Queen Elizabeth will outline Prime Minister Boris Johnson's legislative plans when she opens a new session of Parliament on Monday, but lawmakers are expected to reject them. That could set off a no-confidence vote in Mr. Johnson's leadership, followed by a new election. All of the above leaves Brexit -- and Britain's economy -- in limbo for even longer.Brace for More Bad NewsThe annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund take place in Washington this week, and it sounds like a real party! The I.M.F.'s new managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, will present its World Economic Outlook on Tuesday, and it won't be good. She recently warned that Mr. Trump's trade war with China could cost the global economy around $700 billion by 2020 -- a loss equivalent to the size of Switzerland's entire economy.

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump and his allies seized on debate moments over taxes, health care and economic inequality to portray the Democratic candidates as tax-and-spend liberals.WASHINGTON -- President Trump and his allies sought to turn the Democratic debate on Tuesday night into a referendum on the congressional impeachment inquiry, accusing the party's presidential candidates and its leaders in Washington of pursuing a vendetta against Mr. Trump while ignoring more pressing pocketbook issues.But Republicans also saw an opportunity to seize on debate moments over middle-class tax increases, health care reform and economic inequality to portray the Democrats as tax-and-spend liberals -- in hopes of redirecting the national conversation at a time when public opinion is moving against the president.In a series of early-morning tweets, Mr. Trump referred to the 12 Democrats onstage Tuesday night in Ohio as ""clowns"" who would wreck the economy if ever elected.During the debate, he and his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, gloated about his prospects for re-election, sharing an image from a recent Moody's Analytics model that showed Mr. Trump was favored to win virtually every swing state in the country, including ones he failed to carry in 2016 like Virginia and New Hampshire.This was consistent with the nonchalance that Mr. Trump has tried to project about impeachment and questions of his political vulnerabilities. What the tweets did not include, however, was a second graphic in the model showing a likely Democratic victory if voter turnout is historically high, as it was in the 2018 midterm elections.Tuesday's CNN/New York Times debate was the first since Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives would formally look into whether Mr. Trump committed impeachable offenses for soliciting Ukrainian assistance with his re-election campaign.It was clear from the tenor of the Republican statements -- which were laced with defiance, bluster and scorn -- that the Trump campaign and its allies hope the president can still win over an American public that, polls show, increasingly supports the impeachment inquiry and does not believe Mr. Trump has been truthful about his actions. The remarks also were a preview of the defense that G.O.P. leaders said they were planning as the impeachment inquiry enters a critical new phase on Capitol Hill, with House Democrats calling witnesses and issuing subpoenas to associates of Mr. Trump, like Rudolph W. Giuliani.Republicans intend to argue, in effect, that a wide range of economic indicators -- from the unemployment rate to job growth -- show that Mr. Trump has been far more of a success than he gets credit for, while Democrats remain fixated on attacking him personally and politically.""Democrats spent more time talking about President Trump's Twitter account and their phony impeachment charade than they did a positive vision for America,"" said Ronna McDaniel, chairman of the Republican National Committee. ""That's because they don't have one, and it's going to cost them at the ballot box next November.""Republicans also hope that the more that Democrats talk about impeachment, the more opening they will have to cast it as illegitimate.""It's not lost on people that many of these candidates were actually on the record supporting impeachment before anyone was even talking about Ukraine,"" said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and former Trump White House official.The debate, held outside Columbus, Ohio, allowed Republicans to try to make their case in a state that Mr. Trump won by eight percentage points in 2016 and has many of the middle-class, blue-collar voters that he hopes to turn out again in next year's election. To underscore the point, the Trump campaign took out a full-page ad in the Columbus Dispatch on Tuesday that blared, ""Democrats Will Kill Ohio Jobs ... President Trump's Fighting for the Economy.""The president remains historically unpopular, however. The Gallup presidential approval poll has measured public support for his job performance at below 50 percent for his entire presidency. To overcome this skepticism, Republicans have attempted to define the Democrats as out of touch and too far to the left of where most Americans' views are. Some of the Democratic candidates, like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., hold moderate and liberal views, while Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are generally more progressive.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on Wednesday expressed the kind of binary argument that Republicans hope prevails on voters. ""Last night's debate was a reminder that while you may not always agree with everything Trump says or does, the leading alternatives to Trump mock people with traditional beliefs & support socialism, gun confiscation & free government funded health care for unlawful immigrants,"" he wrote on Twitter.With Ms. Warren the target of sustained attacks from the other Democrats onstage, Mr. Trump and his Republican allies moved to frame the race around the question of whether voters want a strongly liberal president and government in 2021.On Tuesday night, after Mr. Sanders picked up the support of two high-profile liberals in the House Democratic caucus -- Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar -- Republicans jumped at the chance to make them a focal point in the morning-after debate analysis. The two freshmen are a favorite target of conservatives, who have caricatured them as the true leaders of their party.""With this endorsement,"" Ms. McDaniel said later, speaking on Fox News, ""everyone should be paying attention. They will take away our freedom, our fundamental rights.""Other Republicans saw a bigger story in the leading Democrat who was a less prominent presence on Tuesday: Mr. Biden, who seemed to veer from indignant at times to detached at others. They said his uneven performance was a sign that other candidates who displayed more gusto -- like Ms. Warren, Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota -- were gaining prominence at his expense.Alex Castellanos, a veteran Republican strategist, said the debate could be a turning point when ""a new race began, one without Joe Biden.""PhotographPresident Trump at the White House on Tuesday.

| Jump to first hitTHE WHITE HOUSEWASHINGTONDecember 17, 2019The Honorable Nancy Pelosi
Speaker of the House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515Dear Madam Speaker:I write to express my strongest and most powerful protest against the partisan impeachment crusade being pursued by the Democrats in the House of Representatives. This impeachment represents an unprecedented and unconstitutional abuse of power by Democrat Lawmakers, unequaled in nearly two and a half centuries of American legislative history.The Articles of Impeachment introduced by the House Judiciary Committee are not recognizable under any standard of Constitutional theory, interpretation, or jurisprudence. They include no crimes, no misdemeanors, and no offenses whatsoever. You have cheapened the importance of the very ugly word, impeachment!By proceeding with your invalid impeachment, you are violating your oaths of office, you are breaking your allegiance to the Constitution, and you are declaring open war on American Democracy. You dare to invoke the Founding Fathers in pursuit of this election-nullification scheme -- yet your spiteful actions display unfettered contempt for America's founding and your egregious conduct threatens to destroy that which our Founders pledged their very lives to build. Even worse than offending the Founding Fathers, you are offending Americans of faith by continually saying ""I pray for the President,"" when you know this statement is not true, unless it is meant in a negative sense. It is a terrible thing you are doing, but you will have to live with it, not I!Your first claim, ""Abuse of Power,"" is a completely disingenuous, meritless, and baseless invention of your imagination. You know that I had a totally innocent conversation with the President of Ukraine. I then had a second conversation that has been misquoted, mischaracterized, and fraudulently misrepresented. Fortunately, there was a transcript of the conversation taken, and you know from the transcript (which was immediately made available) that the paragraph in question was perfect. I said to President Zelensky: ""I would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it."" I said do us a favor, not me, and our country, not a campaign. I then mentioned the Attorney General of the United States. Every time I talk with a foreign leader, I put America's interests first, just as I did with President Zelensky.You are turning a policy disagreement between two branches of government into an impeachable offense -- it is no more legitimate than the Executive Branch charging members of Congress with crimes for the lawful exercise of legislative power.You know full well that Vice President Biden used his office and $1 billion dollars of U.S. aid money to coerce Ukraine into firing the prosecutor who was digging into the company paying his son millions of dollars. You know this because Biden bragged about it on video. Biden openly stated: ""I said, ""I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars'...I looked at them and said: ""I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.' Well, son of a bitch. He got fired."" Even Joe Biden admitted just days ago in an interview with NPR that it ""looked bad."" Now you are trying to impeach me by falsely accusing me of doing what Joe Biden has admitted he actually did.President Zelensky has repeatedly declared that I did nothing wrong, and that there was No Pressure. He further emphasized that it was a ""good phone call,"" that ""I don't feel pressure,"" and explicitly stressed that ""nobody pushed me."" The Ukrainian Foreign Minister stated very clearly: ""I have never seen a direct link between investigations and security assistance."" He also said there was ""No Pressure."" Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a supporter of Ukraine who met privately with President Zelensky, has said: ""At no time during this meeting...was there any mention by Zelensky or any Ukrainian that they were feeling pressure to do anything in return for the military aid."" Many meetings have been held between representatives of Ukraine and our country. Never once did Ukraine complain about pressure being applied -- not once! Ambassador Sondland testified that I told him: ""No quid pro quo. I want nothing. I want nothing. I want President Zelensky to do the right thing, do what he ran on.""The second claim, so-called ""Obstruction of Congress,"" is preposterous and dangerous. House Democrats are trying to impeach the duly elected President of the United States for asserting Constitutionally based privileges that have been asserted on a bipartisan basis by administrations of both political parties throughout our Nation's history. Under that standard, every American president would have been impeached many times over. As liberal law professor Jonathan Turley warned when addressing Congressional Democrats: ""I can't emphasize this enough...if you impeach a president, if you make a high crime and misdemeanor out of going to the courts, it is an abuse of power. It's your abuse of power. You're doing precisely what you're criticizing the President for doing.""Everyone, you included, knows what is really happening. Your chosen candidate lost the election in 2016, in an Electoral College landslide (306-227), and you and your party have never recovered from this defeat. You have developed a full-fledged case of what many in the media call Trump Derangement Syndrome and sadly, you will never get over it! You are unwilling and unable to accept the verdict issued at the ballot box during the great Election of 2016. So you have spent three straight years attempting to overturn the will of the American people and nullify their votes. You view democracy as your enemy!Speaker Pelosi, you admitted just last week at a public forum that your party's impeachment effort has been going on for two and a half years,"" long before you ever heard about a phone call with Ukraine. Nineteen minutes after I took the oath of office, the Washington Post published a story headlined, ""The Campaign to Impeach President Trump Has Begun."" Less than three months after my inauguration, Representative Maxine Waters stated, ""I'm going to fight every day until he's impeached."" House Democrats introduced the first impeachment resolution against me within months of my inauguration, for what will be regarded as one of our country's best decisions, the firing of James Comey (see Inspector General Reports) -- who the world now knows is one of the dirtiest cops our Nation has ever seen. A ranting and raving Congresswoman, Rashida Tlaib, declared just hours after she was sworn into office, ""We're gonna go in there and we're gonna impeach the motherf****r."" Representative Al Green said in May, ""I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this president, he will get re-elected."" Again, you and your allies said, and did, all of these things long before you ever heard of President Zelensky or anything related to Ukraine. As you know very well, this impeachment drive has nothing to do with Ukraine, or the totally appropriate conversation I had with its new president. It only has to do with your attempt to undo the election of 2016 and steal the election of 2020!Congressman Adam Schiff cheated and lied all the way up to the present day, even going so far as to fraudulently make up, out of thin air, my conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine and read this fantasy language to Congress as though it were said by me. His shameless lies and deceptions, dating all the way back to the Russia Hoax, is one of the main reasons we are here today.You and your party are desperate to distract from America's extraordinary economy, incredible jobs boom, record stock market, soaring confidence, and flourishing citizens. Your party simply cannot compete with our record: 7 million new jobs; the lowest-ever unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans; a rebuilt military; a completely reformed VA with Choice and Accountability for our great veterans; more than 170 new federal judges and two Supreme Court Justices; historic tax and regulation cuts; the elimination of the individual mandate; the first decline in prescription drug prices in half a century; the first new branch of the United States Military since 1947, the Space Force; strong protection of the Second Amendment; criminal justice reform; a defeated ISIS caliphate and the killing of the world's number one terrorist leader, al-Baghdadi; the replacement of the disastrous NAFTA trade deal with the wonderful USMCA (Mexico and Canada); a breakthrough Phase One trade deal with China; massive new trade deals with Japan and South Korea; withdrawal from the terrible Iran Nuclear Deal; cancellation of the unfair and costly Paris Climate Accord; becoming the world's top energy producer; recognition of Israel's capital, opening the American Embassy in Jerusalem, and recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights; a colossal reduction in illegal border crossings, the ending of Catch-and-Release, and the building of the Southern Border Wall -- and that is just the beginning, there is so much more. You cannot defend your extreme policies -- open borders, mass migration, high crime, crippling taxes, socialized healthcare, destruction of American energy, late-term taxpayer-funded abortion, elimination of the Second Amendment, radical far-left theories of law and justice, and constant partisan obstruction of both common sense and common good.There is nothing I would rather do than stop referring to your party as the Do-Nothing Democrats. Unfortunately, I don't know that you will ever give me a chance to do so.After three years of unfair and unwarranted investigations, 45 million dollars spent, 18 angry Democrat prosecutors, the entire force of the FBI, headed by leadership now proven to be totally incompetent and corrupt, you have found NOTHING! Few people in high position could have endured or passed this test. You do not know, nor do you care, the great damage and hurt you have inflicted upon wonderful and loving members of my family. You conducted a fake investigation upon the democratically elected President of the United States, and you are doing it yet again.There are not many people who could have taken the punishment inflicted during this period of time, and yet done so much for the success of America and its citizens. But instead of putting our country first, you have decided to disgrace our country still further. You completely failed with the Mueller report because there was nothing to find, so you decided to take the next hoax that came along, the phone call with Ukraine -- even though it was a perfect call. And by the way, when I speak to foreign countries, there are many people, with permission, listening to the call on both sides of the conversation.You are the ones interfering in America's elections. You are the ones subverting America's Democracy. You are the ones Obstructing Justice. You are the ones bringing pain and suffering to our Republic for your own selfish personal, political, and partisan gain.Before the Impeachment Hoax, it was the Russian Witch Hunt. Against all evidence, and regardless of the truth, you and your deputies claimed that my campaign colluded with the Russians -- a grave, malicious, and slanderous lie, a falsehood like no other. You forced our Nation through turmoil and torment over a wholly fabricated story, illegally purchased from a foreign spy by Hillary Clinton and the DNC in order to assault our democracy. Yet, when the monstrous lie was debunked and this Democrat conspiracy dissolved into dust, you did not apologize. You did not recant. You did not ask to be forgiven. You showed no remorse, no capacity for self-reflection. Instead, you pursued your next libelous and vicious crusade-you engineered an attempt to frame and defame an innocent person. All of this was motivated by personal political calculation. Your Speakership and your party are held hostage by your most deranged and radical representatives of the far left. Each one of your members lives in fear of a socialist primary challenger -- this is what is driving impeachment. Look at Congressman Nadler's challenger. Look at yourself and others. Do not take our country down with your party.If you truly cared about freedom and liberty for our Nation, then you would be devoting your vast investigative resources to exposing the full truth concerning the FBI's horrifying abuses of power before, during, and after the 2016 election -- including the use of spies against my campaign, the submission of false evidence to a FISA court, and the concealment of exculpatory evidence in order to frame the innocent. The FBI has great and honorable people, but the leadership was inept and corrupt. I would think that you would personally be appalled by these revelations, because in your press conference the day you announced impeachment, you tied the impeachment effort directly to the completely discredited Russia Hoax, declaring twice that ""all roads lead to Putin,"" when you know that is an abject lie. I have been far tougher on Russia than President Obama ever even thought to be.Any member of Congress who votes in support of impeachment -- against every shred of truth, fact, evidence, and legal principle -- is showing how deeply they revile the voters and how truly they detest America's Constitutional order. Our Founders feared the tribalization of partisan politics, and you are bringing their worst fears to life.Worse still, I have been deprived of basic Constitutional Due Process from the beginning of this impeachment scam right up until the present. I have been denied the most fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution, including the right to present evidence, to have my own counsel present, to confront accusers, and to call and cross-examine witnesses, like the so-called whistleblower who started this entire hoax with a false report of the phone call that bears no relationship to the actual phone call that was made. Once I presented the transcribed call, which surprised and shocked the fraudsters (they never thought that such evidence would be presented), the so-called whistleblower, and the second whistleblower, disappeared because they got caught, their report was a fraud, and they were no longer going to be made available to us. In other words, once the phone call was made public, your whole plot blew up, but that didn't stop you from continuing.More due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials.You and others on your committees have long said impeachment must be bipartisan -- it is not. You said it was very divisive -- it certainly is, even far more than you ever thought possible -- and it will only get worse!This is nothing more than an illegal, partisan attempted coup that will, based on recent sentiment, badly fail at the voting booth. You are not just after me, as President, you are after the entire Republican Party. But because of this colossal injustice, our party is more united than it has ever been before. History will judge you harshly as you proceed with this impeachment charade. Your legacy will be that of turning the House of Representatives from a revered legislative body into a Star Chamber of partisan persecution.Perhaps most insulting of all is your false display of solemnity. You apparently have so little respect for the American People that you expect them to believe that you are approaching this impeachment somberly, reservedly, and reluctantly. No intelligent person believes what you are saying. Since the moment I won the election, the Democrat Party has been possessed by Impeachment Fever. There is no reticence. This is not a somber affair. You are making a mockery of impeachment and you are scarcely concealing your hatred of me, of the Republican Party, and tens of millions of patriotic Americans. The voters are wise, and they are seeing straight through this empty, hollow, and dangerous game you are playing.I have no doubt the American people will hold you and the Democrats fully responsible in the upcoming 2020 election. They will not soon forgive your perversion of justice and abuse of power.There is far too much that needs to be done to improve the lives of our citizens. It is time for you and the highly partisan Democrats in Congress to immediately cease this impeachment fantasy and get back to work for the American People. While I have no expectation that you will do so, I write this letter to you for the purpose of history and to put my thoughts on a permanent and indelible record.One hundred years from now, when people look back at this affair, I want them to understand it, and learn from it, so that it can never happen to another President again.cc: United States SenateUnited States House of RepresentativesAnnotations by Linda QiuWord count: 2751Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hitAs public hearings began, William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, said he was told President Trump cared more about investigating Joe Biden than he did about Ukraine.WASHINGTON -- The House of Representatives opened historic impeachment hearings on Wednesday and took startling new testimony from a senior American diplomat that further implicated President Trump in a campaign to pressure Ukraine to publicly commit to investigating former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.In a nationally televised hearing from a stately committee room across from the Capitol, William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, brought to life Democrats' allegations that Mr. Trump had abused his office by trying to enlist a foreign power to help him in an election.Mr. Taylor testified to the House Intelligence Committee that he learned only recently of a July telephone call overheard by one of his aides in which the president was preoccupied with Ukraine's willingness to say it would look into Mr. Biden and work by his son Hunter Biden for a Ukrainian energy firm. Immediately afterward, Mr. Taylor said, the aide had been informed that Mr. Trump cared more about ""investigations of Biden"" than he did about Ukraine.A powerful witness for Democrats, Mr. Taylor appeared as Congress embarked on the third set of presidential impeachment hearings in modern times. Forceful, detailed and unflappable in the face of Republican taunts, the veteran diplomat delivered a remarkable rebuke of the actions taken by the president and his allies inside and outside of the government who placed Mr. Trump's political objectives at the center of American policy toward Ukraine.""Security was so important for Ukraine, as well as our own national interests,"" Mr. Taylor testified, describing his growing sense of alarm at learning that $391 million in vital military aid for the former Soviet republic had been held up. ""To withhold that assistance for no good reason other than help with a political campaign made no sense. It was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do. It was illogical. It could not be explained. It was crazy.""The proceedings pushed into the public gaze an epic impeachment clash between Mr. Trump, his Republican allies and Democrats that has shifted into high gear less than a year before the presidential election. In the first impeachment hearing in more than two decades, Mr. Taylor and another seasoned diplomat, George P. Kent, sketched out, in testimony by turns cinematic and dry, a tale of foreign policymaking distorted by a president's political vendettas with a small country facing Russian aggression caught in the middle.Democrats toiled to make their case to a deeply divided nation that Mr. Trump had put the integrity of the 2020 election at risk by withholding the security assistance for Ukraine's war with Russia to try to extract a political advantage for his re-election campaign.""If this is not impeachable conduct,"" demanded Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the committee, ""what is?""Showing no sign of doubts, Mr. Trump's Republican defenders raged against a process they called unfair and illegitimate. They dismissed Mr. Taylor and Mr. Kent -- who between them have 70 years of experience as public servants under presidents of both parties -- as part of a ""politicized bureaucracy"" who were offering nothing more than hearsay and supposition, rather than evidence of impeachable conduct.""The American people see through all this,"" said Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio. ""They understand the facts support the president. They understand this process is unfair. And they see through the whole darn sham.""At the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Trump sought to project an air of confidence in the face of an existential threat to his presidency. Before a working meeting with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Mr. Trump told reporters of the hearing: ""It's a hoax. I'm too busy to watch it.""But even so, Mr. Trump was busy all day retweeting allies defending him. His re-election campaign blasted out a fund-raising solicitation accusing Democrats of ""playing a sick game."" And the Republican National Committee circulated memes making fun of the witnesses as gossips who lacked firsthand information.Asked for his reaction after the hearing ended, Mr. Trump said he had heard ""it is a joke"" and insisted that he had not watched it ""for one minute."" He called the impeachment effort a sham and said, ""It shouldn't be allowed.""Even as the public recitation of facts unfolded in the hearing room, there were signs that Democrats' investigation was still expanding. Investigators scheduled depositions with David Holmes, an official in the United States Embassy in Kiev, and Mark Sandy, of the Office of Management and Budget, for Friday and Saturday. According to an official involved in the inquiry, Mr. Holmes was the aide Mr. Taylor referred to in his new testimony, who told Mr. Taylor about Mr. Trump's singular interest in investigating the Bidens.Mr. Taylor said a member of his staff overheard a telephone conversation in which the president mentioned ""the investigations"" to Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, who then told Mr. Trump ""that the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.""The conversation took place in a restaurant in Kiev one day after the July 25 phone call in which Mr. Trump personally pressed President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and unproven allegations that Ukraine conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 election.When Mr. Holmes inquired after the call what the president thought about Ukraine, Mr. Sondland ""responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for,"" in Mr. Taylor's telling. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, led what Mr. Taylor called a ""highly irregular"" policymaking channel on Ukraine that ran counter to goals of longstanding American policy.The episode was not included in Mr. Taylor's interview with investigators last month because he was not aware of it at the time. But the new disclosure promises to figure prominently when Mr. Sondland appears next week for his own public testimony.Asked Wednesday afternoon about the call, Mr. Trump said, ""I know nothing about that.""Standing beside Mr. Erdogan during a joint news conference at the White House, Mr. Trump pledged to release on Thursday a reconstructed transcript of another phone conversation he had with Mr. Zelensky, that one in April, additional evidence that the White House hopes can distract from the Democrats' case.The revelation came as Mr. Taylor recounted publicly what he had already told investigators privately. He said he had discovered that Mr. Trump was conditioning ""everything"" about the United States' relationship with Ukraine -- including needed military aid and a White House meeting for Ukraine's president -- on the country's willingness to commit publicly to investigations of his political rivals. Mr. Taylor's testimony made it clear that the Ukrainians were well aware of the prerequisite at the time.Asked by a Democratic lawyer if he had ever seen ""another example of foreign aid conditioned on the personal or political interests of the president of the United States,"" Mr. Taylor, in a sonorous voice that echoed through the hearing room, said, ""I have not.""In his opening statement, Mr. Kent said he had concluded by mid-August that Mr. Giuliani's efforts to pressure Mr. Zelensky to open investigations into Mr. Trump's rivals ""were now infecting U.S. engagement with Ukraine, leveraging President Zelensky's desire for a White House meeting.""Mr. Kent also assailed what he called a ""campaign to smear"" American officials serving in Ukraine, which succeeded with the ouster of Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former United States ambassador there.""In my opinion, those attacks undermined U.S. and Ukrainian national interests and damaged our critical bilateral relationship,"" Mr. Kent said in his opening statement.Both witnesses forcefully rejected attempts by Republicans and Democrats to draw them into a partisan drama over the impeachment inquiry, declaring they are not ""Never Trumpers."" Responding to Mr. Jordan's assertion that he was the star witness for the Democrats, Mr. Taylor insisted that he was not a political pawn of either party.""I don't consider myself a star witness for anything,"" he said. ""I think I was clear I'm not here to take one side or the other.""And Mr. Taylor refused to take a position on whether Mr. Trump's actions were impeachable, telling Representative John Ratcliffe, Republican of Texas: ""That is not what either of us are here for. This is your job.""Even so, with the help of another nine public witnesses over the coming 10 days, Democrats hope to lay out a case that will capture the public's attention and convince a majority of Americans that Mr. Trump's actions are worthy of the Constitution's gravest reprimand: possible removal from office.""I don't think President Trump was trying to end corruption in Ukraine,"" said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut. ""I think he was trying to aim corruption in Ukraine at Vice President Biden and at the 2020 election.""Determined to seize what is plainly their best chance to capture the attention of the American public, Mr. Schiff, the committee's chairman, laid out the stakes. He invoked the words of Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, who defiantly told reporters to ""get over it"" when questioned about conditioning military aid to Ukraine to investigations Mr. Trump wanted.""If he sought to condition, coerce, extort or bribe an ally into conducting investigations to aid his re-election campaign, and did so by withholding official acts -- a White House meeting or hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military aid -- must we simply 'get over it'?"" Mr. Schiff asked. ""Is this what Americans should now expect from their president?""Mr. Schiff gaveled in Wednesday's hearing exactly 50 days after Speaker Nancy Pelosi opened the impeachment inquiry.The public hearings are a turning point for House Democrats from which they are unlikely to turn back. The Ukraine inquiry, after months of pursuit of Mr. Trump and years of Democratic agony over his flouting of political norms, now appears to have too much momentum to be turned back short of impeachment, even if it means muscling through a partisan vote akin to Republicans' impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998.Whether the inquiry has any chance of penetrating the intense partisan polarization that has gripped the country in recent years remains the central question for Democrats and Mr. Trump. Public polling suggests a slight majority of the country supports the inquiry, but Democratic leaders privately concede that given Mr. Trump's fervent base of support, almost no scenario could tip the country more decisively against him.Republicans cannot stop Democrats from impeaching Mr. Trump, but they are determined to ensure that any vote to do so is partisan. Their strategy is multipronged. It includes defending Mr. Trump's interest in Ukrainian corruption as legitimate, and portraying Democrats as desperate to find something, anything, to take out Mr. Trump.""The main performance, the Russia hoax, has ended, and you've been cast in the low-rent Ukrainian sequel,"" said Representative Devin Nunes of California, the Intelligence Committee's top Republican, said Wednesday in an opening statement.He spoke of a ""politicized bureaucracy"" working against Mr. Trump, saying that diplomats in the State Department had worked to undercut the president. In the process, Mr. Nunes said, they had ""lost the confidence of millions of Americans who believe that their vote should count for something.""PhotographWILLIAM B.

| Jump to first hitIn a wide-ranging ""60 Minutes"" interview that aired Sunday, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. declared himself the Democratic front-runner, defended his son's foreign business dealings and explained why it was critical for the country's future to defeat President Trump in 2020.""What I am worried about is the country,"" Mr. Biden said. ""Four years of Donald Trump will be very hard to overcome, but we can. Eight years of Donald Trump will fundamentally change the nature of who we are as a country. And it'll take a generation, a generation or more for us to get back on track.""Making a pitch for his presidential bid as the nomination contest tightens, Mr. Biden emphasized his experience.""I think, as I said, we need somebody who, on day one, knows exactly what to do, can command the world stage,"" Mr. Biden said. ""No one wonders whether I know a great deal about these issues and foreign policy and domestic policy. They're things I've done.""Noting that the president calls Mr. Biden ""Sleepy Joe,"" the ""60 Minutes"" anchor Norah O'Donnell said some people worried about whether Mr. Biden was ""quick enough"" to defend himself against Mr. Trump.""What they're really trying to make the case is about age,"" said Mr. Biden, who will turn 77 in November. ""And with age comes experience, with experience comes wisdom, and with wisdom comes judgment.""The CBS interview with Ms. O'Donnell, taped at Mr. Biden's Delaware home days earlier, marked his first major network sit-down since Mr. Trump, 73, launched attacks on the international business dealings of Mr. Biden's son Hunter Biden.Revelations that the president had pressured Ukrainian authorities to investigate the Bidens prompted the impeachment inquiry that Mr. Trump now faces in the House of Representatives.Asked why Mr. Biden did not tell his son to avoid a role in the Ukrainian gas company Burisma for fear it might appear improper, Mr. Biden said, ""He was already on the board. And he's a grown man. And it turns out he did not do a single thing wrong, as everybody's investigated.""Mr. Biden added that he had never discussed business with his children. ""They know where I have to do my job and that's it and they have to make their own judgments,"" he said.Taking aim at Mr. Trump's family, Mr. Biden said, ""Look, I wasn't raised to go after the children. Their actions speak for themselves,"" adding, ""If I'm president, get elected president, my children are not going to have offices in the White House. My children are not going to sit in on cabinet meetings,"" Mr. Biden said.""It's just simply improper because you should make it clear to the American public that everything you're doing is for them,"" Mr. Biden said. ""And the idea that you're going to have his children, his son-in-law, et cetera, engaged in the day-to-day operation of things they know nothing about.""The president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, should not be negotiating Middle East peace, Mr. Biden said. ""What credentials does he bring to that?""With little more than three months until the first caucus, in Iowa, most national public polls show Mr. Biden leading his top opponents, Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, although one poll recently placed Ms. Warren at the head of the pack.Asked whether he was worried that his opponents were exciting young voters by offering dramatic change, Mr. Biden said that while he wants young people engaged, older voters -- a demographic in which Mr. Biden has considerable support -- will ultimately control the outcome of the nomination race.""Overwhelmingly, people over the age of 50 vote in these primaries,"" Mr. Biden said. He also took aim at his rivals for what he called far-reaching assertions.""I mean, let's talk about 'Medicare for all,""' he said of the single-player health system that Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders support. ""Do you think there's been any truth in advertising on that? It's going to raise taxes on middle class people, not just wealthy people."" Mr. Biden proposes a plan that would build on the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, maintaining a public option for those who need it.Ms. Warren's recent advance -- combined with the fund-raising difficulties of Mr. Biden's campaign -- have left some of his supporters worried.Expressing optimism, Mr. Biden said, ""I know I'm the front-runner,"" adding that he wasn't concerned about money. ""We're on a course to do extremely well,"" Mr. Biden said. ""I'm not -- I'm not worried about being able to fund this campaign.""In the last fund-raising quarter, his campaign said it had only $9 million cash in hand, far less than that of his key rivals. But Mr. Biden's campaign recently reversed course on its longstanding opposition to the assistance of super PACs, opening the door for wealthy supporters to spend unlimited amounts of money to assist his Democratic primary candidacy.Mr. Biden was pressed by a CBS News reporter on this reversal after a campaign event in Durham, N.C., also Sunday night, and the former vice president pointed to the barrage of attack ads he has faced from Mr. Trump's allies.""I learned after the fact from, from my folks, there are a lot of people who said, 'We can't let this stand,""' he said ""They are able to do that. I haven't discouraged them from doing it, but I haven't encouraged it either. I've just stayed away. Hands off. But if I'm the nominee and if I win, I promise you I'm going to continue to push for a constitutional amendment to make sure that there's public funding of elections.""During his ""60 Minutes"" interview, Ms. O'Donnell also hammered Mr. Biden about his debate gaffes. While he acknowledged that the Democratic debates had presented a ""learning curve"" for him, his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, who sat in on part of the interview, expressed confidence that the public would overlook them.""The American people know who Joe Biden is,"" Dr. Biden said. ""I mean, if he misspeaks one word -- that doesn't affect the way they're going to vote, one way or the other.""When Ms. O'Donnell asked Dr. Biden whether she had observed any ""change in his ability to communicate in recent years,"" she laughed, ""No. Not at all.""Katie Glueck contributed reporting.

| Jump to first hitLast month, the Trump family business received approval from a local government in Scotland for a major expansion of its golf resort near Aberdeen, marking the largest real estate development financed by the Trump Organization since the 2016 election.In August, President Trump's eldest son, Donald Jr., flew to Jakarta to help kick-start sales at a pair of Trump-branded luxury resorts planned for Indonesia. He appeared at a private event with wealthy prospective buyers and joined his politically connected billionaire Indonesian business partner at a news conference.And last year, Donald Jr. visited India to sell condos at future Trump-branded towers, appearing at an event that also featured India's prime minister.""I'm here as a businessman,"" Mr. Trump told the gathering in New Delhi. ""I'm not representing anyone.""But for the children of the politically powerful, personal business and public dealings can often be indistinguishable, especially when private projects depend on foreign governments that are looking to bolster ties with Washington.In recent weeks, as the president has become embroiled in a scandal involving his interactions with Ukraine, Donald Trump Jr. and his brother Eric have taken to attacking Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., for his business dealings in Ukraine and China.The brothers have accused him of leveraging his family name for personal gain while his father served in the Obama administration. Among other things, Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company that has been a focus of Mr. Trump's interest in the country.""At the VERY LEAST, there's the appearance of impropriety,"" Donald Trump Jr. wrote on Twitter. ""A clear conflict of interest."" At a rally in Minneapolis on Thursday, Eric Trump's charged remarks about the former vice president's son inspired the crowd of Trump supporters to chant, ""Lock him up!""Republicans, led by the president, have sought to make Hunter Biden's international business dealings an issue in the impeachment debate in Washington. But the high-profile attack roles being played by Mr. Trump's eldest sons have now thrust their own business dealings into the spotlight too.Both sons have operated and promoted the Trump family business overseas during their father's presidency, even as he retains ownership. And while the Trump and Biden father-son relationships differ in many ways, the business dealings have set up a simple parallel.""They are criticizing the vice president's son for doing exactly what they are doing themselves,"" said Martin Ford, a member of the Aberdeenshire Council in Scotland, which voted last month to approve a proposal by the Trumps to build a 500-unit housing development. ""They are conducting international business here in Scotland.""Eric Trump, in a statement to The New York Times, said there was a distinction between his father's career in business, with his recent turn to politics, and Mr. Biden's decades in public office.""When my father became president, our family stopped doing international business deals,"" he said, a reference to a pledge by the Trump Organization not to begin new overseas projects during the Trump presidency. Hunter Biden, he said, did the opposite when his father became vice president.The Trump business activities in India, Indonesia and Scotland were considered in compliance with the pledge, according to the company's ethics rules, because they were building on deals already in the works.Mr. Biden's campaign declined to comment on Friday. But in a tweet, the former vice president once again suggested that the attacks on his son were part of a political smear campaign. ""Let me make something clear to President Trump: I'm not going anywhere,"" he wrote. ""You're not going to destroy me. And you're not going to destroy my family. I don't care how dirty the attacks get.""Conducting business on the international stage has long been standard for the Trump Organization, which has placed the Trump name on hotels and towers in several countries.But its international dealings have become far more complicated since Mr. Trump took office and his sons took leadership of the business, especially when foreign governments have been involved to the company's benefit.When the Trump Organization tangled with the majority owner of a property in Panama, for example, its local lawyers at one point called on the Panamanian president for an assist.In Indonesia, the government is helping to build a major new highway that will make a new Trump development more accessible. Construction is scheduled to begin soon on what will be known as Trump Residences Lido, which will include 280 homes, a golf course and a hotel, south of Jakarta.The Trump family's partner in Indonesia -- a billionaire named Hary Tanoesoedibjo -- is financing the project, with the Trump family getting a cut of the sales.In marketing materials released this summer, which featured the Trump family logo and a photograph of Donald Trump Jr., the company noted that the ""Trump Residences Lido can be accessed directly through the newly opened Bocimi Toll Road.""In Scotland, the Aberdeenshire Council recently dropped an earlier requirement that the new housing development could not be built until the Trumps spent tens of millions of dollars on other investments at the resort.Sebastian Leslie, a local official who supported the project, said the family received no special consideration. ""We don't do that -- we don't give anybody special favors,"" Mr. Leslie said.But Mr. Martin, a council member who opposed the approval, said the Trumps benefited handsomely from the change. ""It is a much, much more lucrative deal now,"" he said.Revenues coming to the Trump family in the United States have drawn scrutiny too, including at the Trump International Hotel in Washington -- a property, opened in the final stages of the 2016 campaign, that has flourished while Donald Trump Jr. and Eric have run the company.The hotel has been a magnet for Republican lobbyists and political fund-raisers, and companies and foreign officials with business before the Trump administration have thrown parties there, including the Kuwait embassy and the government of Azerbaijan.Mr. Trump's daughter Ivanka has also retained a stake in the family business even as she serves as a White House adviser, and last year she received trademarks in China related to her separate fashion ventures. Her husband, Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to the president, maintains a stake in his own family's real estate business, which has received and sought funding from international sources as well.In 2017, Mr. Kushner met privately at the White House with top executives from Citibank and the private equity firm Apollo Global Management. Those meetings came as the firms were contemplating sizable loans to his family's business, Kushner Companies, which they did eventually make.And since Mr. Kushner entered the White House, his family has courted state-connected investors in China and the Middle East -- both regions that were in Mr. Kushner's government portfolio -- to bail out the firm's headquarters at 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.But the presidency has also come with some costs for the Trump family business since the sons have been at the helm.The company had been banking on global expansion to drive its growth, but when the president agreed to put a hold on new foreign deals, it curtailed those ambitions for his sons.George Sorial, the company's chief compliance counsel when the policy was developed, said it was the right thing to do even though it was not required by law and had cost the company significantly.Eric Trump, in his statement to The Times, suggested that even the decision to forgo new foreign deals could be seen through the prism of Hunter Biden.""My father was one of the most famous businessmen on earth and he sacrificed billions to be our president,"" he said. ""Joe Biden was an incredibly influential politician -- his family made millions.""The Biden campaign also sees opportunity in the nasty dispute. In a fund-raising email sent on Friday, the campaign singled out the Trump sons and the ""lock him up"" chant at the Thursday rally. ""We are fighting back against this nonsense as hard as we know how every single day,"" the campaign wrote.Jesse Drucker contributed reporting.PhotographDonald Trump Jr. with his family's business partner in Indonesia, the billionaire Hary Tanoesoedibjo, at a news conference for a new resort in August.

| Jump to first hitAmy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg are vying to become the pragmatic alternative to Joe Biden. Mr. Sanders is trumpeting endorsements to compete with Elizabeth Warren.COLUMBUS, Ohio -- For months, the Democratic presidential race has seemed to move inexorably toward a confrontation between former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. As Ms. Warren gathered financial support and strength in the polls, Mr. Biden steadily slid on both fronts while the rest of the Democratic field stagnated with voters. A jumbled primary appeared on the verge of becoming a contest between two front-runners.But the debate in central Ohio on Tuesday night showed that the rest of the Democratic pack was not ready to yield.From the moderate wing of the party, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota are now confronting Ms. Warren directly on her policy views and challenging Mr. Biden implicitly for his status as the party's dominant centrist. From the left, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has returned to the race with force after a heart attack that shook his candidacy, collecting valuable endorsements from prominent left-wing women in Congress, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, in assailing Ms. Warren by name, and Mr. Sanders, in rolling out endorsements from the most coveted figures in progressive politics, are acknowledging the same urgency about halting the drift toward a two-person primary.But that task could be easier because of what may ultimately prove to be this week's most consequential development: Mr. Biden, who raised $6.3 million on the day he entered the race in April, revealed Tuesday that he has run through so much money that he has less than $9 million left. That is far less than what the two leading liberals in the race, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, as well as Mr. Buttigieg, have on hand.Mr. Biden insisted on Wednesday that he was ""confident"" in his financial position and was not contemplating any changes to his campaign because of money. But between Mr. Biden's apparent weakness, the sudden onslaught against Ms. Warren and signs of new relevance from Mr. Sanders, there is now at least enough uncertainty in the race to encourage even long-shot candidates to persist.""People have been saying the race was going to solidify into Biden-versus-Warren,"" said Paul Begala, a longtime Democratic strategist. ""I think instead it has become more fluid than ever.""Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, who is backing Ms. Klobuchar, said in an interview Wednesday he believed there was still plenty of room to make headway in the Democratic race, because many voters were only now ""really listening and tuning in.""""It felt like the moment is here,"" Mr. Walz said of the debate.Without criticizing other candidates by name, Mr. Walz predicted Ms. Klobuchar would appeal to ""a broader swath of folks"" beyond activists on the left, and also to voters' ""hunger to get back to a decency and a normalcy"" -- political currents Mr. Biden has sought to tap into, with mixed success.Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, of course, continue to loom over their rivals and it is unlikely that the debate will prompt an immediate change in fortunes for either candidate. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden attempted to reassert himself by taking on Ms. Warren in more caustic terms at an event in Ohio. He called it ""absolutely ridiculous"" that Ms. Warren had not been clearer about how she would pay for a ""Medicare for all"" system and challenged her to be ""candid and honest"" about it.At the moment, Ms. Warren appears to have an upper hand in most of the early-voting states, along with a powerful campaign war chest stocked with a reservoir of online donors, while Mr. Biden still holds a slight lead in national polls and the conviction among many older Democrats that he would be the safest nominee to challenge President Trump.Yet both Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren have vulnerabilities that their underdog opponents are now determined to exploit: his poll numbers have dropped steadily since the start of the summer and his campaign is in the midst of a financial crunch. And Ms. Warren must still allay Democratic concerns about her strength as a general-election candidate and strike a delicate balance between locking down liberal voters who also like Mr. Sanders while growing her support among moderates and racial minorities.Aaron Pickrell, an Ohio-based Democratic strategist, said the debate had shown that ""other candidates getting into the top tier is not insurmountable."" Both Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg, he said, had begun to break through with a message of Midwestern pragmatism that could appeal to voters in the early states.""They're setting themselves up as a potential alternative for Biden,"" Mr. Pickrell said. ""You can see these folks breaking through when we get to Iowa.""Surveys there indicate that about half the Democrats planning to participate in the caucuses are moderate or conservative; many of these voters have said they are uncommitted or are supporting Mr. Biden but willing to change their minds.Some candidates have more maneuvering room than others to challenge the two leaders: Whereas Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders are flush with cash, Ms. Klobuchar is in a far more tenuous financial position and has yet to qualify for the debate in November. At least a few other candidates who took an assertive approach Tuesday are in similar straits, straining to raise money or meet the debate threshold or both.What could prove decisive in Iowa, and beyond, is if centrist voters coalesce behind a single candidate or fracture among the group of hopefuls presenting themselves as pragmatists. If Mr. Biden cannot recover a measure of momentum, but holds on to enough support to block other candidates from building a coalition of more moderate Democrats, it could allow Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders to roll through the earliest primaries and caucuses with relatively weak opposition.This scenario, of a sort of zombie Biden candidacy, is what most alarms supporters of other center-left Democrats in the race.Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, a close ally of Mr. Buttigieg, predicted the South Bend mayor would now ""dig down deep in Iowa and New Hampshire,"" carrying his message from the debate -- a combination of uplifting rhetoric about the future and blunt criticism of certain progressive policies -- into the early states where he's polling in fourth place.Ms. Whaley said she expected Mr. Buttigieg, 37, to make a determined effort to displace Mr. Biden as the candidate seen as most capable of speaking to Midwesterners.""What you have with Pete is, you have somebody who speaks so amazingly well to this part of the country and is incredibly electable,"" Ms. Whaley said, adding, ""What Biden does is, he tells you all he's done for us, which really hasn't been enough because we've had 30 years of failed policy in the Midwest.""But it is not Mr. Buttigieg who is depending on millennials to claim the nomination -- it's the oldest candidate in the race, the 78-year-old Mr. Sanders.And that is why his endorsements from Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota -- and an expected one from Rashida Tlaib of Michigan -- could prove so vital to at least sustaining his campaign. Their appeal with younger progressives offers Mr. Sanders a vote of confidence he can trumpet to the voting bloc that makes up his strongest constituency.That cue has particular resonance in this moment, when even some of the senator's supporters have been wondering about his prospects following his hospitalization and acknowledgment that he may have to slow down the pace of his campaign.""Their endorsement is huge in validating him as a face for the party and movement going forward,"" said Representative Ro Khanna of California, a co-chair of Mr. Sanders's campaign.Mr. Khanna said the backing from three women of color would help Mr. Sanders in another crucial way at a time when Democrats are moving left on racial issues -- by rebutting the criticism that his is a niche campaign for white, left-wing men.""It's hard to say we're just Bernie Bros when you have the most visible progressives from communities of color coming out and saying, 'We're for Bernie Sanders,""' Mr. Khanna argued. ""That's more powerful than what Bernie Sanders or any of his co-chairs can say about his polling or support.""The question now, for Mr. Sanders and the other well-funded contenders, is how they begin spending their money. With the race moving into the fall and the candidates needing ways to get attention amid saturation of coverage with the impeachment inquiry, many Democrats expect the attacks on the debate stage to begin playing out on the airwaves.Even more than the verbal fisticuffs and flashy endorsements, it was Mr. Biden's comparably weak financial standing that prompted many Democrats to think a new phase may be at hand.""That went off like a bomb this morning,"" said Mr. Begala, noting that his phone was ""blowing up with texts"" about the putative front-runner's money struggles.Mr. Biden's problem could be even more dire than it appears, Mr. Begala said. That's because he is so reliant on raising money from wealthy donors, who are often fickle and want to pick a winner, while those who outraised him can keep bringing in contributions online without devoting so much time and money to finance events.PhotographSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, top, had been climbing the polls ahead of Tuesday's debate.

| Jump to first hitJulián Castro and Kamala Harris are pitching themselves partially on being a 'first,' but neither is gaining traction.LAS VEGAS -- Julián Castro's fund-raising appeal last month was blunt. ""Tragic mistake,"" the subject line read, emphatically written in all capital letters. ""Only Latino candidate could be cut from debate stage.""The message was clear: How could Democrats forgo the symbolic significance of a Latino candidate onstage, especially when Latinos are expected to be the largest ethnic voting bloc come November 2020?But symbolism is not carrying the weight it once did.Mr. Castro, the former housing secretary, failed to meet the qualifications for next week's debate by the Wednesday night deadline. He has had standout moments in the previous debates, criticizing former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and pushing other Democrats on immigration, so not making the stage is a blow for his candidacy, though aides said he has no immediate plans to exit the race.More than a decade after President Barack Obama made history as the first African-American elected to the White House, the field of Democratic candidates is more diverse than ever. Mr. Castro would be the first Latino nominee, Senator Kamala Harris of California the first woman of color -- facts they point out frequently while campaigning.Yet among voters, there seems to be relatively tepid enthusiasm to elect another first, or at least to support a candidate who would be barrier-breaking, whether that is part of the appeal or not. Polls have consistently shown Mr. Biden leading among African-American voters, while Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is widely popular among Latinos, particularly younger voters.For decades, conventional political wisdom has suggested that voters are eager to cast their ballot for someone who looks like them -- something that has historically been difficult or impossible in presidential races filled with white men. Now, the struggles of Mr. Castro and Ms. Harris suggest that whatever power symbolism and the potential of being the first once had has all but evaporated this election season.""Some of the luster has come off of firsts,"" said Rev. Jesse Jackson, who was one of the first viable African-American presidential candidates. ""When I was the black person on the stage, it was like a crusade. It was so new, so novel, it was almost like a global event. Then Barack had much of the same in 2008, but since then the rules have changed.""Most Democrats say they would not be any more enthusiastic if the nominee were black or Hispanic, according to a poll by the Pew Research Center conducted earlier this year. Roughly a third of black Democrats said they would be more enthusiastic with a black nominee, and less than half of Hispanic Democrats said they would be more excited by a Hispanic candidate.During a recent Las Vegas town hall sponsored by the Culinary Workers Union, Ms. Harris made her pitch for the support from a crowd filled almost entirely with Latina and black women, many of them immigrants who make a living cleaning the hotel rooms in this tourist-dependent city. Ms. Harris spoke plainly about what she has been referring to as the ""donkey in the room.""The conversation about electability -- specifically, her electability -- she said, often goes something like this: I'm willing to vote for you, but I don't know if my neighbor is.Ms. Harris was eager to say out loud the thought she believed others were keeping to themselves.""I don't know if America is ready for a woman of color, with an immigrant background to be president of the United States,"" said Ms. Harris, who was briefly interrupted by shouts of ""yes we are!"" By turning the question of electability on its head, Ms. Harris was making the case that electing a woman of color was not only possible, but that doing so would be a powerful statement.After she spoke for an hour, Morlaina Bruce sat back in a chair with her arms folded across her chest, taking in the scene. Ms. Bruce, a 50-year-old housekeeper at Circus Circus who planned to caucus for the first time this year, said she was unmoved by the argument.""Am I more likely to choose an African-American woman because I'm an African-American woman? No, I don't really care about that,"" she said. ""It's definitely not enough. I think we hear a lot of talk and I want to know more what people have actually done and what they're about.""More than anything, Ms. Bruce said, she cared about getting Mr. Trump out of office. And while she is still undecided, Ms. Bruce said she believes Mr. Biden is best positioned to beat Mr. Trump, because ""he's been there, he knows what he's doing.""The pervasive focus of trying to defeat Mr. Trump has eclipsed all else in Democratic circles, making it difficult for would-be firsts to make an argument for a history making candidacy.""The right-wing substance of Trump overrides the symbolism of everybody else,"" Mr. Jackson said.When Mr. Castro spoke at a forum sponsored by the League of United Latin American Citizens in Des Moines last month, the largely young and Latino crowd sat with rapt attention as he made the case to become the first Hispanic president. And in interviews after the event, several voters said they were interested in his candidacy, but not swayed to vote for him.""It's pretty amazing to see someone up there who looks like you, who comes from a similar background,"" said Anthony Arroyo, a 20-year-old student at Drake University. ""But it's certainly not enough for me -- it's not the only thing by a long shot.""Still, one candidate has benefited by his own demographic: Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who would be the first openly gay nominee, has received significant financial support from wealthy gay donors, whose money helped propel him toward the top tier in polling.And Indian Americans have enthusiastically contributed to Ms. Harris, whose mother immigrated to the United States from India to attend college. Mr. Castro has received the financial support from many Latino donors who are eager for him to stay in the race even if they have formally endorsed another candidate.But for their part, Latinos and African-Americans have appeared split on their favorite -- no poll has shown Ms. Harris or Mr. Castro receiving the majority of the support among those voters.""Somebody who looks like me is important, but it is also important to have somebody who can understand me and shares my values, and most importantly, can get elected,"" said Eliseo Medina, a former international executive vice president of Service Employees International Union and the first Mexican-American in that role.""Symbolism and firsts are important, but they are not the sole judgments that people make. There was a very strong pitch about being the first woman for Hillary Clinton and I don't think that went very far. If anything, people reacted to it in a negative manner.""Both Mr. Castro and Ms. Harris have sharpened their pitch about being the first in recent months, as they have struggled in polls. But they also appear keenly aware of the pitfalls of being pigeonholed as primarily for black or Latino voters.""Ethnic pride can help, but it has never won an election outright and there's always the possibility of turning other voters off,"" said Arturo Vargas, the president of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. ""It's also about context and circumstance. I think it's incredibly important to have that symbolism right now, when in essence the role of Latinos in America is one of the biggest aspects of this election.""""But it's about the candidate too -- I think the only thing that's lacking in the Castro campaign is a little more spark.""PhotographSenator Kamala Harris, who would be the first woman of color to win the Democratic Party's nomination, and Julián Castro, who would be the first Latino nominee, remain mired in the polls.

| Jump to first hitWhat's the best way to cover the run-up to the Iowa caucuses? Become a (temporary) Iowan.Hi. Welcome to On Politics , your guide to the day in national politics.I'm Sydney Ember, writing from a coffee shop in Des Moines, filling in for Lisa Lerer, who is on vacation somewhere that is hopefully warmer than it is here.On Tuesday, I became one of Iowa's temporary residents. Every four years, this state puts up with a ton of us reporters in anticipation of the first-in-the-nation caucuses that kick-start the primary season. Strategists set up shop here. Campaign staff members move into supporters' homes. Even candidates themselves sometimes relocate here (hi, Chris Dodd!), hoping that their daily proximity -- and maybe those casual chats with Iowans in their local coffee shop -- will translate into support come February.Why am I here? Ask my editors! But in all seriousness, I'm in Iowa to observe, firsthand, the final sprint to caucus night and everything that gets caught up in it. So for the next three months, I'll be driving all around the state to hear pitches from candidates, ask campaign staffers about their strategies on the ground, and of course, talk to as many Iowans as I can. After all, it's these people who will help determine the trajectory, if not the outcome, of the Democratic primary.I've already met some Iowans I can't stop thinking about. Last week, during one of my many trips to the state in advance of my move, I went to see former Vice President Joe Biden, who entered the race a front-runner but has seen his standing slowly slip in Iowa. One 83-year-old woman I talked to at an event on Halloween said she liked Mr. Biden but was volunteering for another candidate -- Elizabeth Warren. But the real catch? She didn't plan to caucus. She preferred to spend winters out of state.This woman, Henrietta Van Maanen, was a good example of what I'm learning about Iowa: Many Democrats are still undecided. But perhaps more important, a lot -- and I mean, a lot -- of people don't caucus. Though the state has more than two million eligible voters, the biggest turnout for one party's presidential caucus was in 2008, when some 240,000 people participated in the Democratic contest that featured Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton -- only 40 percent of registered Democrats. In other years, the number has been much lower.Political observers are expecting a huge turnout this year, though. And from what I've seen on the ground, even as early as March, general enthusiasm is very high. But part of what makes the race still so fluid is that the excitement is spread among several top candidates. Even among likely caucusgoers who have a first choice in mind, about half say they might change their pick before the caucus, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released this week.I'll be bringing you many more observations from Iowa in the coming weeks. But first, I need to get myself a warmer winter jacket.Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We'll try to answer it. Have a comment? We're all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com .Speaking of which, thanks to all of you who emailed us about our mistake in yesterday's email! We promise, we will never ""pour over"" election results again. Unless we spill our coffee.The week in impeachmentWith the impeachment inquiry racing ahead, it can be hard to keep track of the daily stream of new developments. So our colleague Noah Weiland , who writes our Impeachment Briefing newsletter, has volunteered to catch us up every Thursday on what's happened during the week. We finally saw interview transcripts. Last week, when House Democrats voted to formally endorse the impeachment inquiry, they outlined two important steps they would take in making the investigation public: releasing deposition transcripts and holding hearings. This week, we saw the transcripts for Bill Taylor, the top American diplomat in Ukraine; Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine; Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union; Kurt Volker, the special envoy to Ukraine; and Michael McKinley, a former top aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  A key witness changed his testimony. Mr. Sondland, who is considered loyal to President Trump and functioned as a behind-the-scenes facilitator of his dealings with Ukraine, updated and reversed testimony that he gave last month, saying he had ""refreshed"" his memory. He admitted to a crucial part of what investigators have been piecing together: He told a top Ukrainian official that the country would most likely have to give Mr. Trump what he wanted -- a public pledge to investigate Joe Biden and his son -- in order to unlock military aid.  Democrats set dates for the first public hearings. Next Wednesday, Mr. Taylor and George Kent, a Ukraine expert at the State Department, will take part in a live, televised joint hearing. Two days later, Ms. Yovanovitch will testify publicly. The hearings will give House Democrats a way to visually package and present the key facts they've uncovered. Mr. Taylor is considered their star witness. In the over 300 pages of his interview transcript released this week, he told investigators in great detail how Mr. Trump's attempts to engage Ukraine in a quid pro quo over military aid unfolded.  Rudy Giuliani again emerged as arguably the central figure in the impeachment investigation. In several of the transcripts, we saw how concerned high-ranking officials were about the role of Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, in convincing the president that the Bidens had corrupt business dealings in Ukraine and of a conspiracy theory about Ukrainian election meddling. Mr. Volker told investigators that Mr. Giuliani planted the idea in Mr. Trump's mind that Ukraine was out to get him. Mr. Sondland said that American diplomacy goals in Ukraine were dependent on keeping Mr. Giuliani ""satisfied."" That involved making sure Ukraine's president knew that in order to meet Mr. Trump at the White House and receive the military aid, he had to publicly pledge to investigate Mr. Trump's political rivals.  This week featured a lot of no-shows. Among others, Democrats called on John Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser; John Eisenberg, the top lawyer on the National Security Council; and Robert Blair, an aide to Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, to testify this week, but none of them showed up voluntarily. Democrats have decided against potentially lengthy court battles to enforce subpoenas, out of a concern for wrapping up the investigation in an efficient way. They even pulled a subpoena they had issued for testimony from Charles Kupperman, a former deputy to Mr. Bolton.  We finally saw interview transcripts.

| Jump to first hitWASHINGTON -- The 30-second video ad released by the Trump campaign last week is grainy, and the narrator's voice is foreboding. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., it says, offered Ukraine $1 billion in aid if the country pushed out the man investigating a company tied to Mr. Biden's son.Saying it made false accusations, CNN immediately refused to air the advertisement.But Facebook did not, and on Tuesday, the social network rejected a request from Mr. Biden's presidential campaign to take it down, foreshadowing a continuing fight over misinformation on the service during the 2020 election as well as the impeachment inquiry into President Trump.In a letter to the Biden campaign, Facebook said the ad, which has been viewed five million times on the site, did not violate company policies. Last month, the social network, which has more than two billion users, announced that politicians and their campaigns had nearly free rein over content they post there.Even false statements and misleading content in ads, the company has said, are an important part of the political conversation.""Our approach is grounded in Facebook's fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is,"" Facebook's head of global elections policy, Katie Harbath, wrote in the letter to the Biden campaign.The decision by the company illustrates its executives' hardened resolve to stay out of the moderation of political speech, despite the use of the social network to spread discord and disinformation in the 2016 presidential campaign. On Tuesday, the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee released a sobering report warning of fresh signs of interference by Russia and other foreign nations in the 2020 election.The company's position stands in contrast to CNN, which rejected two ads from the Trump campaign last week, including the one the Biden campaign asked Facebook to take down. The cable channel said it rejected the ad because it ""makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets.""Facebook has been dogged by accusations of censorship by conservative politicians, including President Trump, who argue that the Silicon Valley company gives greater attention to liberal points of views on the social network.But by removing itself as the moderator of political content -- including in paid ads on the site -- Facebook has left itself open another avenue of criticism. In a series of tweets Monday evening, Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the front-runners for the Democratic nomination, said Facebook allowed President Trump to spread false information widely, and called on the company to take down the attack ad against Mr. Biden, one of her top rivals.""Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once because they were asleep at the wheel while Russia attacked our democracy -- allowing fake, foreign accounts to run ad campaigns to influence our elections,"" Ms. Warren wrote.Facebook declined to comment.The ad the Biden campaign asked Facebook to take down, released by the Trump campaign on Sept. 27, starts with staticky shots of Mr. Biden meeting with Ukrainian officials during his time in the Obama administration.""Joe Biden promised Ukraine $1 billion if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son's company,"" a narrator says, using video from an event in which Mr. Biden mentions the money. ""But when President Trump asks Ukraine to investigate corruption, the Democrats want to impeach him.""The $1 billion figure was mentioned at an event in 2018 at the Council on Foreign Relations, in which Mr. Biden was talking about how the Obama administration tried to root out corruption in Ukraine. He said he had held back financial aid to push the country to make reforms.There is no evidence that Mr. Biden, during his time as vice president, pushed for the dismissal of the Ukrainian prosecutor general to help his son Hunter Biden. The former vice president, along with other members of the Obama administration and other international leaders, pushed for the removal of the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, because of accusations that he ignored corruption.Days after the ad was broadcast on television and social networks the Biden campaign wrote a letter to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, asking to reject the ad. The video ""spreads false, definitively debunked conspiracy theories regarding Vice President Joe Biden,"" Greg Schultz, a Biden campaign manager, wrote to the Facebook leaders.Mr. Schultz wrote that the vice president's call for a new prosecutor in Ukraine's investigation of a company was supported by the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. He included clippings from The Washington Post and Factcheck.org that debunked the claims of Mr. Biden's motives of squashing the investigation to benefit his son.After CNN rejected the ad last week, Tim Murtaugh, the communications director for Mr. Trump's campaign, said that the ad was ""entirely accurate and was reviewed by counsel.""""CNN spends all day protecting Joe Biden in their programming,"" Mr. Murtaugh wrote in a statement. ""So it's not surprising that they're shielding him from truthful advertising, too.""The Biden campaign also urged Fox News to reject the Trump campaign ad last week. But the cable channel declined to do so, saying that it was ""not in the business of censoring ads from candidates on either sides of the aisle.""The ad has also appeared on YouTube and Twitter. A spokesman for Twitter said on Tuesday that the ad complied with its policies. A YouTube official likewise said the ad complied with its policies.T.J. Ducklo, a spokesman for Mr. Biden, wrote in an email that ""Donald Trump has demonstrated he will continue to subvert our democratic institutions for his own personal gain, but his shortcomings are no excuse for companies like Facebook to refuse to do the right thing.""PhotographFacebook is intent on staying out of the moderation of political speech, despite the use of the social network to spread discord and disinformation in the 2016 presidential campaign.

| Jump to first hitIn an April 2017 interview with The Associated Press, President Trump suddenly began talking about the hack of the Democratic National Committee a year earlier, complaining that the F.B.I. had not physically examined the compromised server.""They brought in another company that I hear is Ukrainian-based,"" the president said.""CrowdStrike?"" the surprised reporter asked, referring to the California cybersecurity company that investigated how Russian government hackers had stolen and leaked Democratic emails, disrupting Hillary Clinton's campaign.""That's what I heard,"" Mr. Trump resumed. ""I heard it's owned by a very rich Ukrainian; that's what I heard.""More than two years later, Mr. Trump was still holding on to this false conspiracy theory. In his July call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, he summed it up in a sort of shorthand -- at least according to the White House memorandum, labeled ""not a verbatim transcript.""""I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike ... I guess you have one of your wealthy people ...,"" the president said. It is unclear whether the ellipses indicate that words were omitted or that Mr. Trump's voice was trailing off.Then he added one novel detail: ""The server, they say Ukraine has it.""Now, Mr. Trump's call for Ukraine to look into his CrowdStrike story forms the background to the House impeachment inquiry, which is focused on the second request he made: that Mr. Zelensky investigate Mr. Trump's possible 2020 opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Mr. Trump has placed a concoction of disprovable claims, of the kind usually found on the fringes of the web, squarely in the middle of American politics and diplomacy.The tale of the supposedly hidden server may have appealed to Mr. Trump because it undercut a well-established fact that he has resented and resisted for three years: The Russian government interfered in the 2016 election to help him win, an effort thoroughly documented by American intelligence agencies and amply supported by public evidence.By contrast, there is no evidence to support the president's vague suggestion that Ukraine, not Russia, might be responsible for the hacking, or that CrowdStrike somehow connived in it. But his alternate history has provided a psychological shield for the president against facts that he believes tarnish his electoral victory.Mr. Trump has long called for better relations with Vladimir V. Putin's Russia and brushed aside complaints about its conduct. So there is a certain symmetry to his suggestion that Ukraine, Russia's opponent and the victim of its territorial grab, may somehow have framed Russia for the 2016 election activity.""Ukraine is the perfect scapegoat for him, because it's the enemy of Russia,"" said Nina Jankowicz, a fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington who regularly visits Ukraine and is writing a book called ""How to Lose the Information War.""She noted that a number of Ukraine-linked stories, some of them distorted or exaggerated, have been pulled together by Mr. Trump's supporters into a single narrative.For example, there is the idea, promoted by the president's lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, that Ukraine's government actively sabotaged Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign. A Ukrainian-American lawyer who consulted for the D.N.C. looked into the finances of Paul Manafort and spoke with Ukrainian embassy officials. But there appears to have been no organized Ukrainian government effort to intervene -- certainly nothing comparable to the activities of Russian intelligence agencies ordered by Mr. Putin.It is true that a Ukrainian legislator helped publicize documents on Mr. Manafort's multimillion-dollar payments from a Ukrainian political party, leading to his resignation as Mr. Trump's campaign chairman. But the claim of Mr. Manafort's wrongdoing turned out to be justified. He is now serving seven and a half years in prison for financial fraud and other crimes.In May, Mr. Trump recalled the American ambassador to Kiev, Marie L. Yovanovitch, appointed by President Barack Obama in 2016, telling others she was scheming against his administration. She has denied it.And Mr. Trump has repeatedly charged that Mr. Biden, who handled Ukrainian affairs as vice president, tried to get a prosecutor fired for investigating a Ukrainian energy company that paid his son, Hunter, handsomely as a board member despite a lack of experience in Ukraine. In fact, multiple countries were pressing for the firing of the prosecutor, who they thought was turning a blind eye to corruption.""Now it seems like all of these conspiracy theories are merging into one,"" Ms. Jankowicz said. She studies disinformation, she said, but Mr. Trump produced one claim she'd never come across.""I do this for a living, and I'd never heard anyone say the servers were in Ukraine,"" she said.Twitter removed a video posted by Mr. Trump that showed a meme of Nickelbacker's lead singer, edited as an attack on Joe Biden.In the 27 months between Mr. Trump's two citations of the CrowdStrike-Ukraine conspiracy theory, it has survived despite many denials from CrowdStrike, the F.B.I. and people directly involved in the investigations. It has survived despite the fact that the D.N.C. put one of its hacked servers on display -- not in Ukraine but in its Washington offices beside the filing cabinet pried open in 1972 by the Watergate burglars (and a photo of the two artifacts ran on The Times's front page). It has survived despite the indictment prepared last year by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, laying out in extraordinary detail the actions of 12 named Russian military intelligence officers who hacked the D.N.C. and other election targets.The speculation springs from what Mr. Trump has called a ""big Dem scam"" -- the false notion that the F.B.I. never really investigated the D.N.C. hack. In fact, according to people directly involved, CrowdStrike was in regular contact with the bureau in spring 2016 as it examined dozens of servers used by both the D.N.C. and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.It is true, as Mr. Trump has often tweeted, that F.B.I. agents never took physical possession of the Democrats' servers. But CrowdStrike supplied the F.B.I. with digital copies of the servers so that the bureau could assess the Russian malware infecting them. The Mueller investigation later confirmed CrowdStrike's findings.Still, the president has clung to the theory linking CrowdStrike, Ukraine and the D.N.C. servers despite the repeated efforts of his aides to dissuade him, Thomas Bossert, his former homeland security adviser, said on Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" ""The D.N.C. server and that conspiracy theory has got to go,"" he said. ""If he continues to focus on that white whale, it's going to bring him down.""To go in search of the roots of Mr. Trump's CrowdStrike-Ukraine conspiracy theory is to travel the internet's most peculiar provinces and the darkest threads on Twitter and Facebook. On 4chan and pro-Trump spaces on Reddit, on websites like ZeroHedge.com and Washington's Blog, you can find plenty of speculation about evil manipulation by CrowdStrike and secret maneuvers by Ukrainians -- often inflamed by Mr. Trump's own statements.Until the president's statements, however, even internet speculation did not attribute CrowdStrike's ownership to a rich Ukrainian or suggest that the D.N.C. servers were hidden in Ukraine.George Eliason, an American journalist who lives in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists fought Ukrainian forces, has written extensively about what he considers to be a ""coup attempt"" against President Trump involving American and Ukrainian intelligence agencies and CrowdStrike. He said he did not know if his writings for obscure websites might have influenced the president.""CrowdStrike and Ukrainian Intel are working hand in glove,"" he wrote in an email. ""Is Ukrainian Intelligence trying to invent a reason for the U.S. to take a hardline stance against Russia? Are they using CrowdStrike to carry this out?""Mr. Eliason and other purveyors of Ukraine conspiracies often point to the Atlantic Council, a research group in Washington, as the locus of the schemes. The Ukrainian oligarch Viktor Pinchuk has made donations to the council and serves on its international advisory board; Dmitri Alperovitch, CrowdStrike's co-founder, who was born in Russia and came to the United States as a child, is an Atlantic Council senior fellow.That connection seems slender, but it may be the origin of Mr. Trump's association of a wealthy Ukrainian with CrowdStrike.Pro-Trump media leaped last week to defend the president's Ukraine theories. Rush Limbaugh said on his radio show that Mr. Trump's ""reference to CrowdStrike, mark my words, is momentous,"" though he did not say why.And Russian state news outlets are always ready to cheer on Mr. Trump's efforts to point the blame for the 2016 hack away from Moscow. On Sept. 25, after the White House released its memo on the Zelensky call, Russia's Sputnik news website ran a story supporting Mr. Trump's remarks.The Sputnik article cited Mr. Eliason's writings and suggested that CrowdStrike might have framed Russia for the D.N.C. hack -- if it occurred at all. It quoted a Twitter account called ""The Last Refuge"" declaring: ""The D.N.C. servers were never hacked.""All this mythmaking about the 2016 hack frustrates Robert Johnston, who was the lead investigator for CrowdStrike on the D.N.C. inquiry. Mr. Johnston, a former Marine and Cyber Command operator, said he could make no sense of Mr. Trump's assertions.""It doesn't connect with anything in my experience,"" he said. ""I'd be interested in the president of Ukraine's impression.""Mr. Johnston, now chief executive of the cybersecurity company Adlumin, said he was weary of the conspiracies surrounding what he considered a straightforward conclusion. Having seen the digital fingerprints of Russian intelligence in earlier hacking cases, he felt there was little doubt about the identity of the perpetrators.""I don't know how you get to this point,"" Mr. Johnston said of the fantasies Mr. Trump has promoted. ""This is a story that just won't die.""PhotographRudolph W. Giuliani, left, promoted the idea that Ukraine sabotaged the Trump campaign. A Ukrainian legislator helped publicize documents on Paul Manafort's payments from a Ukrainian party, a claim of wrongdoing against Mr. Manafort that was justified.

| Jump to first hitJoseph R. Biden Jr.'s presidential campaign sent Facebook a letter about a false video ad that a super PAC ran on the social network.WASHINGTON -- A 30-second video ad that ran on Facebook this week falsely accused former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. of blackmailing Ukrainian officials to stop an investigation of his son.""Send Quid Pro Joe Biden into retirement,"" a narrator in the ad intoned.The video wasn't released by the Trump campaign, which has produced ads on Facebook with similar accusations in recent weeks. Instead, it was made by an independent political action committee, or super PAC. And it was allowed to run on Facebook with false information, in violation of the social network's policies on misinformation, the Biden presidential campaign wrote in a letter to Facebook on Thursday.In the letter, which was viewed by The New York Times, the Biden campaign acknowledged that Facebook had a policy of allowing all political leaders' speech and ads to remain up because the company considers them to be newsworthy. But the ad by the super PAC was not from a politician, the Biden campaign wrote, so it needed to be rejected.""This is a most basic test,"" Greg Schultz, Mr. Biden's campaign manager, said in the letter. ""The ad contains transparently false allegations, prominently debunked by every major media outlet in the country over recent weeks. It should be rejected.""The letter exposed another vulnerability for Facebook as it struggles to tackle misinformation in the political ads that are flooding its site ahead of the 2020 presidential election. And it showed that Mr. Biden is escalating a battle against Facebook, blasting it in the letter for selling ""the tools to target certain segments of the population with lies.""The Biden campaign's letter was delivered on the same day that Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, delivered a vigorous defense of free expression in a speech in Washington. In the address, which drew strong rebukes from Democrats and civil rights leaders, Mr. Zuckerberg argued that even falsehoods from a politician were important for public discourse.But Facebook had promised that any other political ads would be submitted to fact-checking. The Biden campaign said that should have included the ad from the super PAC, the Committee to Defend the President.In an emailed response to the Biden campaign on Friday, which was viewed by The Times, Facebook's head of global campaigns, Katie Harbath, wrote that the ad was now inactive. If the ad ran again, she said, it would be submitted to fact-checking.Facebook declined to comment further.A week ago, an ad placed by the Trump campaign made similarly false corruption accusations about Mr. Biden. At the time, Mr. Biden's campaign also sent Facebook a letter asking for the ad's removal. Facebook refused, saying the ad was from a political leader and thus in the public interest.That decision was criticized by the Biden campaign and Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democrat from Massachusetts, who has promised to break up Facebook if elected president. Ms. Warren later posted a deliberately false ad on Facebook about Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Trump, daring the company to take it down.The super PAC's ad this week opened with a silhouette of Mr. Biden in front of an image of the White House. A narrator in a foreboding voice claimed the former vice president had blackmailed and threatened to withhold aid from Ukraine to stop an investigation into a company associated with his son Hunter.Six versions of the ad were targeted to Facebook users in South Carolina, Iowa and Massachusetts, according to Facebook's ad library. All versions are no longer active.For years, Facebook has been assailed for unevenly enforcing its content policies across its family of apps, including Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. The company often reacted to problematic content that surfaced and made seemingly arbitrary decisions to reinstate or remove a given post.In one of the best-known incidents, in 2016, moderators took down the Pulitzer Prize-winning image of Phan Thi Kim Phuc, the 8-year-old girl who was photographed fleeing napalm bombs during the Vietnam War. Because Ms. Phuc was naked, the image was removed from Facebook for reasons of child pornography. When Facebook was told about the news value of the image, it was allowed to remain.Facebook does not permit certain types of material, such as pornography and posts that could incite violence, including hate speech and ""dehumanizing"" language.The issue of what Facebook allows and does not allow on its site is unlikely to die down.At a campaign event on Friday evening in Norfolk, Va., Ms. Warren took a couple of more shots at Mr. Zuckerberg. As she talked about breaking up big tech companies, she said, ""Yes, Mark Zuckerberg, I'm looking at you.""When Ms. Warren discussed a wealth tax in her speech, she again brought him up. ""And Mark Zuckerberg, I'm still looking at you,"" she said.Cecilia Kang reported from Washington, and Mike Isaac from Boston. Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting from Norfolk, Va.PhotographThe campaign of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. noted in a letter to Facebook that a false ad had been placed by a super PAC, not by another political leader.

| Jump to first hitDreading the political debate at your Thanksgiving meal? At least you're not a political reporter!One of the professional hazards of being a national political reporter is most certainly Thanksgiving.You think political discussions at your holiday dinner are intense? Try coming over to one of our houses!But professional political observers or not, we are all now living in the era of divisive dinner, a moment when our politics have grown so polarized that they can ruin even the best prepared stuffing.There's some data on this: A majority of adults say they ""dread the thought of having to talk about politics at Thanksgiving dinner,"" according to a poll conducted in 2017 by PBS ""NewsHour,"" NPR and Marist.So, I figured, who better to ask for advice on navigating those heated discussions than my colleagues, who deal with divisive politics for a living?My question kicked off quite the debate on The New York Times politics desk.There are the Avoiders.Thanksgiving is supposed to be a day away from work, and some of us have strategies to keep it that way.""My secret: Rotisserate the bird. You can spend most of the day outside fussing with the grill and out of earshot,"" said national correspondent Trip Gabriel, who will spend his holiday in balmy Westchester County, N.Y.Nick Corasaniti, our New Jersey correspondent turned political reporter and Tuesday newsletter host, wants to distract his family with a Jersey turkey. ""Instead of putting bacon on the bird as it roasts, cover it in Taylor ham,"" he said. ""This will be enough of a conversation starter that we will only talk about how brilliant this idea is."" (Sorry, Cory Booker, we don't have many vegans on staff.)Sydney Ember, who has moved to Iowa to cover the caucuses, will be spending the holiday in Massachusetts. She has a simple request: ""Don't ask me about Iowa.""There are the Regionalists.All politics is local, right?""Yes, Bill de Blasio ran for president,"" Matt Flegenheimer, our super-New Yorker political reporter, plans to tell his family. ""I promise, I was there. I think.""National political correspondent Jonathan Martin's answer? ""Football and oysters"" are far more ""fulfilling distractions"" at his New Orleans holiday table.Jennifer Medina, our Los Angeles-based political reporter, is going to tell her relatives just how important they are. ""If politics is mentioned at all, it will be something like 'Do votes in California really matter?""' she said. ""To which I will then stand on my soapbox and talk about how much the West will matter this cycle, both in the primary (Nevada is third! California will start voting as Iowans caucus!) and in the general (Arizona! Texas?! And Nevada, again!).""And there are the Embracers.Our political reporter Jeremy Peters, who will be spending the holidays in St. John in the United States Virgin Islands, plans to offer this piece of wisdom: ""Stop asking me who's going to win.

Herndon, who will be in Flossmoor, Ill. ""I truly don't get what people talk about for that much time without talking about politics.""Then there are the real pros.To resolve all these conflicting views, I went to a true political professional: Senator Amy Klobuchar, whom I happened to see over the weekend in New Hampshire. She plans on spending the holiday in Iowa with her husband and daughter.Unsurprisingly, she's fully supportive of political debate at the Thanksgiving table. (And of yam casserole, her favorite holiday dish -- though she was careful to note that it's not a Minnesota ""hot dish."")""I'm saying go for it, and maybe mention that there is a senator from Minnesota,"" she said.Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers.

Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com .Obama on 2020: Your responsesLast week, we asked for readers' reactions to former President Barack Obama's comments about the 2020 race. Mr. Obama stirred the pot, after all, when he cautioned the Democratic presidential candidates not to move too far to the left on policy, saying that ""the average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.""And wow, did you have thoughts! Nearly 800 of you wrote to share your views of Mr. Obama's remarks, and the reaction was, shall we say, fiercely divided.Here's what some of you had to say:""He misunderstands how many people, including those of us who like him, still see his signature achievements as half delivered. ... We didn't just want hope. We wanted him to fight for us. And now, living in Trump's America, we want someone who will fight for us."" -- Diana Wynne, San Francisco""I am a Democrat who thinks that President Obama's remarks were spot on. I am terrified that Democrats will lose the next election if we have a left-wing candidate in 2020. I think some Democrats and most independents will not be willing to vote for someone on the left wing of the Democratic Party. They just might decide to not vote at all."" -- Julia Gibson, The Woodlands, Texas""I think he was wrong. People know much of what politicians say when running for office is aspirational. We know they can't waive a magic wand and make it so. We also know that on several fronts, including the environment especially, we are running out of time. This is a time for bold policy ideas, not incrementalism."" -- Mark Burnham, Cranston, R.I.""I'm here in rural Wisconsin. I think he's right that people aren't ready for such dramatic change. It does not seem timely to expect voters to swerve so dramatically left now, when they need to be coaxed back into trusting a Democratic Party that will show up for an average American who is neither far left or far right."" -- Sharon LaCour, Amery, Wis.""Obama's not reading the country. Maybe too busy hobnobbing with the rich and famous to see that America is losing its innocence. People want change, real change. Not the porridge they were fed during his administration."" -- Wanda Gumm, Los Angeles""Clearly he is giving his best advice -- and I agree 100 percent. ... Our extended family is 24 voters -- 20 registered Republicans, all of whom will vote for Biden and who all voted for Gov. Kasich [John Kasich of Ohio, a 2016 Republican primary candidate], not Trump.

| Jump to first hitOn a warm summer evening last year, Lev Parnas stepped aboard a private cruise around New York Harbor for a gathering of some of Rudolph W. Giuliani's closest friends.The passengers sipped wine and cocktails while they sailed past the Statue of Liberty, singing along as another guest, the entertainer Joe Piscopo, belted out ""Theme from New York, New York."" Mr. Giuliani, a personal lawyer to President Trump, relaxed on the open deck in a bright blue polo shirt as the sun set over Lower Manhattan, a video of the event shows.The August 2018 cruise, which was won in a charity auction, came at a pivotal moment in Mr. Giuliani's relationship with Mr. Parnas and his associate Igor Fruman, both Soviet-born businessmen from Florida who were among the newest entrants to his circle.Mr. Parnas had recently struck up a friendship with Mr. Giuliani while recruiting him for a business deal, but now the men were on the verge of something bigger: teaming up to unearth damaging information on Mr. Trump's political rivals.In the coming months, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman helped Mr. Giuliani carry out a shadow diplomacy campaign, sweeping them into a chain of events that has led to the impeachment of a president for only the third time in American history. As the impeachment began moving on Wednesday from the House to the Senate, the story of their work together was a reminder that the case against Mr. Trump is more than just a political battle in Washington. It is about the allure of presidential power, and the people who drew near to it as they sought political influence or financial gain.The goal of the campaign, according to witnesses in the impeachment hearings and a reconstructed transcript of a call between Mr. Trump and the Ukrainian president, was for Ukraine to pursue two investigations that could benefit Mr. Trump politically. One dealt with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter; the other centered on claims that Ukrainians meddled in the 2016 election, including a debunked theory that Ukraine -- and not Russia -- stole Democratic emails.Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman had chased riches from one venture to another, with no footing in government or diplomacy. But in a trajectory emblematic of the Trump era, they emerged from obscurity to play a crucial role in the pressure campaign through a tangle of transactional relationships and overlapping interests.First, the men bought or wheedled their way into private dinners with Mr. Trump and access to his inauguration celebration, where they could find a circle of Republican donors to invest in and advise their own business endeavors.Then, after Mr. Parnas secured Mr. Giuliani's help for one of his business ventures in a half-million-dollar deal, Mr. Giuliani saw that they had something else to offer him: the ability to make connections in Ukraine. And so, they landed at the fulcrum of an international effort that could both aid the president and anchor their future fortunes.Mr. Parnas, now 47, was a perennial pitchman who exuded sincerity, an aspiring entrepreneur with a history of debts and aborted businesses. He tooled around in a Ferrari and wooed new sources of capital with boasts of ties to important people.Mr. Fruman, a 53-year-old who spoke a mix of Russian and choppy English, had more direct links to Ukraine: He invested in a sprawl of businesses there that were once worth millions of dollars -- nightspots, a beach club, a dealership selling Jaguars that was part-owned by a local politician -- as well as a New York-based import-export company. But in a sign that his fortunes had started to change, Mr. Fruman funded the men's entree into Republican circles by refinancing a condominium in Sunny Isles, a South Florida enclave of Russian émigrés.Together, they became ubiquitous in the Republican donor set, known simply as ""Lev and Igor,"" a duo seemingly ripped from a movie script.This account is based on based on interviews with more than three dozen people in the United States and Ukraine and a review of photographs, credit card transactions, internal memos, and American and Ukrainian court documents and corporate filings.While Mr. Parnas's Instagram posts show appearances at Republican fund-raisers and Mr. Giuliani's birthday party at Yankee Stadium, it was in private meetings at BLT Prime, the steakhouse at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, where he and Mr. Fruman became unlikely agents of the Ukrainian initiative.Mr. Parnas did most of the talking, but Mr. Fruman's Ukrainian ties were critical to their efforts. Two people familiar with the matter said Mr. Fruman helped arrange an initial meeting between Mr. Giuliani and a Ukrainian prosecutor who claimed to have damaging information about targets of Mr. Trump, laying part of the foundation for their mission.""For what they did, they did a very good job,"" Mr. Giuliani said in an interview this week. He recalled telling an associate: ""They were perfect. They did everything I wanted, and they never got involved in asking questions.""Ultimately, none of their connections, in either Ukraine or Washington, could save them. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman were arrested in October on campaign finance charges brought by Manhattan federal prosecutors. The prosecutors are now investigating whether Mr. Giuliani engaged in illegal lobbying on behalf of Ukrainian interests.Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman have pleaded not guilty, and Mr. Giuliani has denied wrongdoing, saying he was advocating for his client, Mr. Trump. The president has disavowed knowing Mr. Fruman or Mr. Parnas, and Mr. Parnas, feeling betrayed, has broken with Mr. Giuliani and supplied information to Congress about his work for him and Mr. Trump.Mr. Giuliani has played down the men's role in his efforts, saying it was limited to setting up meetings.In court this week, a federal prosecutor in the case argued that Mr. Parnas's bail should be revoked and he should be returned to jail, saying that he had exhibited ""a pattern of misleading the government."" The prosecutor cited, in part, his financial ties to Dmitry Firtash, a Ukrainian energy tycoon who has been charged with bribery in the United States and has been fighting extradition.A lawyer for Mr. Parnas, Joseph A. Bondy, disputed the government's contention and cited ""his vocal willingness to stand up and to tell the truth."" A judge declined to revoke Mr. Parnas's bail.Mr. Fruman has not spoken publicly since his arrest, and his lawyer, Todd Blanche, declined to comment. Mr. Giuliani said in the interview that his and Mr. Fruman's legal teams entered into an agreement about two months ago allowing them to share information.""It's so strange how Igor became part of this scandal,"" said Gennady Medvedev, who co-owned an Asian-themed restaurant in Kyiv called Buddha-Bar with Mr. Fruman and others. ""If a person takes enough pictures next to famous people, he will start to believe he is an important man himself.""A Key to Trump WorldThe first time Mr. Parnas spoke with Mr. Trump, he wanted to make a personal connection.It was October 2015, and Mr. Trump was clinging to first place in the Republican presidential primary campaign. Mr. Parnas and his 16-year-old son drove from their home in Boca Raton, Fla., to the Trump National Doral Miami, a resort and golf club, for a raucous campaign rally, according to Mr. Bondy, Mr. Parnas's lawyer.Before the rally, Mr. Parnas shook hands with the candidate and told him about a long-ago, if tenuous, connection to the Trump family. As a young man in Brooklyn, he had sold co-op apartments built by Mr. Trump's father, prompting the men to joke that Mr. Parnas's son might one day work for Mr. Trump, Mr. Bondy said.It was a brief but exhilarating encounter for someone born in Ukraine who had arrived in the United States at age 4. His family started out poor in Brooklyn's Brighton Beach neighborhood: Mr. Parnas's father died when he was 11, and his mother worked long shifts at a salon. At 15, he left school. He sold real estate before working for years as a stockbroker and eventually moving to Boca Raton in 1995.Over nearly two decades, he created or became an officer in at least 20 companies. One was a publicly traded technology penny stock called EdgeTech International Inc.Arty Dozortsev, a liquor distributor who knew Mr. Parnas from Brooklyn and said he lost $20,000 on EdgeTech, recalled his pulling up in a Rolls-Royce wearing diamonds and an expensive watch, ""looking like he's worth a million bucks.""""It was kind of enticing,"" Mr. Dozortsev said.After the money from his ventures dried up, Mr. Parnas would pawn his jewelry and look for a new deal.By 2012, he had teamed up with David Correia, a former golf pro, and they created a start-up called Fraud Guarantee, intended to offer an insurance-like product to protect investors against scams. They worked on the idea, on and off, for the next seven years, but never got it off the ground.The pair had been sued over more than $27,000 in unpaid rent on their suite in a Boca Raton office park. Not long after that, a federal judge in New York ordered Mr. Parnas to pay $510,000 to a man who had pursued him for years over a soured movie deal.But Mr. Parnas did not behave like a man running from debts when he heard, in September 2016, of an upcoming Trump fund-raiser near his home.One night at Lique, a Miami restaurant and lounge where Soviet émigrés liked to gather, Mr. Parnas learned that a construction magnate, Robert W. Pereira, wanted to host a fund-raising dinner for Mr. Trump. The event would be at Le Palais Royal, the gilded mansion Mr. Pereira had modeled after the Palace of Versailles.""I know so many wealthy people,"" Mr. Parnas exclaimed, offering to recruit contributors, according to a person who heard the comment.But the dinner coincided with the close of Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement, and Mr. Parnas did not bring any donors. He gave $50,000 to attend.Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani were there, and Mr. Parnas met Brian Ballard, an influential Florida lobbyist who was close to Mr. Trump.The introduction to Mr. Ballard was brief but crucial: Mr. Parnas had gained a key to Trump World.He built a relationship with Mr. Ballard, promising to introduce him to potential international lobbying clients. Soon after the fund-raiser, Mr. Parnas flew with Mr. Pereira on his plane to watch Mr. Trump debate Hillary Clinton in Las Vegas. On Election Day, they flew together again to attend Mr. Trump's victory celebration in Midtown Manhattan.Mr. Ballard and Mr. Pereira have not been accused of any wrongdoing.After Mr. Trump's victory, Mr. Parnas advanced deeper into the president's circle.He spent New Year's Eve at Mar-a-Lago, where video footage shows him standing next to Mr. Trump. When the time came for Mr. Trump's inauguration, Mr. Parnas secured a pricey attendee package at no cost, thanks to his connections in Florida Republican fund-raising circles. The passes gave Mr. Parnas entry to a black-tie inaugural ball and, on the eve of the swearing-in, a candlelight dinner in Union Station.Mr. Fruman, a longtime acquaintance of Mr. Parnas, joined the entourage, two people familiar with the festivities said. Mr. Parnas brought his wife and two of his sons to Washington for the hoopla. After years of living from boom to bust, he had never had such proximity to wealth and power. The possibilities were staggering.'Everybody Had to Impress Everybody'For the two men, the rest of 2017 did not live up to the promise that Mr. Trump's inauguration seemed to portend.Mr. Fruman was going through a contentious divorce. Born in Belarus before moving to Ukraine, he emigrated to the United States in his 20s and later became a citizen. But most of his financial dealings remained in Ukraine, where he was active in the business community of Odessa, a centuries-old Black Sea port.A promotional brochure from about a decade ago identified him as the head of a residential real estate and retail company in Ukraine, Otrada Luxury Group. Real estate records suggest the business focused on residential properties and hotels. One featured a nightclub called Mafia Rave.Mr. Medvedev, his former partner in Buddha-Bar, said Mr. Fruman also owned luxury watch and high-end fashion shops. He gave other businessmen expensive watches as presents and mingled in post-Soviet nouveau riche circles.""He never was a big businessman, but in the early days, everybody had to impress everybody,"" Mr. Medvedev said.Successes were mixed with failures. Mr. Fruman sold his stake in the restaurant after the global financial crisis, according to his former partner. A canned milk and baby food factory that he had co-owned and that had employed about 800 people went bankrupt in 2010.Last year, during a divorce hearing, Mr. Fruman said his business had ""become worse and worse"" and he had lost an important coffee distribution contract. Mr. Fruman told the judge he had earned about $336,000 in salary from his company in each of the two previous years. His wife's lawyer questioned whether he had disclosed all his income.In late 2017, Mr. Fruman connected with Mr. Parnas, who was struggling after a falling-out with both Mr. Ballard and prospective business partners with whom he had explored real estate deals. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman developed a plan to create a company that would ship liquefied natural gas to Ukraine.To do so, they needed help from American energy executives, some of whom were big Trump donors. The men decided to make political contributions, giving them access to events filled with people who might invest and provide expertise.In February 2018, Mr. Fruman gave $2,700 to the Trump Victory committee, and he and Mr. Parnas attended a fund-raiser at Mar-a-Lago for Protect the House, a committee supporting Republican candidates in the midterm elections. They ultimately committed to donating to Protect the House and giving $1 million to a pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action.But they were short of cash. So in the spring of 2018, Mr. Fruman borrowed against one of his condos to make their biggest contribution yet: $325,000 to America First Action, in the name of their newly created energy company, Global Energy Producers.Although they didn't fulfill all of their promised donations, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman attended some 10 Republican events.Taking Aim at an AmbassadorIn late April 2018, their expedition into Republican politics brought them to Mr. Trump directly, at a private dinner in a two-level luxury suite in his Washington hotel.Mingling with the likes of Jack Nicklaus III, the grandson of the famous golfer, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman awaited the arrival of Mr. Trump. When the president entered the room flanked by his son Donald Trump Jr., the dozen or so guests showered them with applause, a video shows.As they ate, the conversation veered into Ukraine.Over a dinner of the ""Presidential Cheeseburger"" and wedge salad, Mr. Parnas relayed a rumor that Marie L. Yovanovitch, then the American ambassador to Ukraine, was bad-mouthing the president -- an unsubstantiated claim that Ms. Yovanovitch has denied, according to two people with knowledge of the dinner.The exchange foreshadowed the role that Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman would come to play in Mr. Trump's Ukrainian campaign.Less than two weeks later, Mr. Parnas met with another critic of Ms. Yovanovitch, Representative Pete Sessions of Texas, in his Washington congressional office. Mr. Parnas, who had recently met Mr. Sessions at a fund-raiser, showed him a map of a crucial pipeline related to their gas venture, a photo shows.By the end of the meeting, though, the topic had shifted to Ms. Yovanovitch, and Mr. Parnas reiterated what he had heard, a person briefed on the meeting said. After the meeting, Mr. Sessions sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying that Ms. Yovanovitch had spoken disdainfully of the Trump administration, and suggesting her removal. Mr. Sessions, who lost his re-election bid last year, has previously said he wrote the letter independently of Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, after speaking to congressional colleagues.Federal prosecutors contend in the indictment against Mr. Parnas that he was not just making small talk but sought to oust Ms. Yovanovitch ""at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials,"" which could be a violation of federal laws that require Americans to register with the Justice Department when lobbying for foreign political interests. The indictment did not name any Ukrainian officials.The men have not been charged with anything related to Ms. Yovanovitch, but prosecutors have said that additional charges are likely, at least for Mr. Parnas.When the State Department declined to act on Ms. Yovanovitch, Mr. Sessions provided Mr. Parnas with a copy of his letter, a person familiar with the exchange said. The congressman's name was signed across the back of the envelope, and ""Mr. President"" appeared across the front, photos show. Mr. Sessions ""has no memory of"" the exchange, a person close to the former congressman said.Mr. Parnas approached the president a few days later during an America First Action donor event at the Trump International Hotel. A photo of the event shows Mr. Trump, next to Mr. Parnas, tucking an envelope into his own breast pocket.It is unclear whether it was the same envelope, and the White House did not respond to a request for comment.A Mission in UkraineIn mid-July, Mr. Parnas returned to the Trump Hotel to recruit a new ally: Mr. Giuliani.Mr. Parnas, who arranged for the introduction through a Miami lawyer who went to law school with Mr. Giuliani, hoped to enlist him as an endorser and adviser for his passion project, Fraud Guarantee. After Mr. Parnas made his pitch, the men agreed to a deal with an initial payment of $500,000.Mr. Correia, Mr. Parnas's partner in the venture, notified the company's investors of the good news, proclaiming in a letter that Mr. Giuliani was ""willing to put his name and reputation on the line"" for Fraud Guarantee and that his company would help ""open doors.""By August 2018, Mr. Parnas was cruising around Manhattan on the boat ride with Mr. Giuliani and his friends. A month later, Mr. Giuliani brought him and Mr. Fruman to his yearly dinner marking the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. Soon after that, Mr. Parnas named Mr. Giuliani the godfather of his newborn son.""I happen to like him,"" Mr. Giuliani said in the interview this week. ""I'm not walking away from the fact that I consider them friends,"" he said of the two men.By early this year, their relationship had turned to a more pressing matter for Mr. Giuliani: Ukraine.Mr. Giuliani credited Mr. Fruman and Mr. Parnas with arranging a meeting he had with Viktor Shokin, Ukraine's former top prosecutor who had been ousted amid accusations, including from Mr. Biden, of overlooking corruption. Mr. Shokin could not get a visa to come to the United States, so he and Mr. Giuliani spoke over Skype.In their Jan. 23 call, Mr. Shokin suggested he had been pushed out for investigating Hunter Biden and payments he had received as a board member of a Ukrainian gas company, according to a memo summarizing the conversation. Witnesses in the impeachment hearings disputed Mr. Shokin's allegation.Within days of the Skype call, Mr. Giuliani met in person with Mr. Shokin's successor, Yuriy Lutsenko.This meeting came about in part through Mr. Fruman's connection to a regional Ukrainian prosecutor he knew from Odessa, according to two people with knowledge of the arrangements. The regional prosecutor had traveled with Mr. Lutsenko to New York, where they met with Mr. Giuliani, as well as Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. In conversations over two days, Mr. Lutsenko called Mr. Giuliani's attention to payments from the gas company to Hunter Biden.Mr. Lutsenko and the regional prosecutor declined to comment.Now it was time for Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman to hit the ground in Ukraine.In February, they set off with Mr. Giuliani for Warsaw, where they met with Mr. Lutsenko, who in turn could help arrange meetings with Ukrainian officials. Mr. Giuliani said that he had dinner with Mr. Lutsenko in Warsaw, but that it was a purely social event. Afterward, Mr. Giuliani returned home, but Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman went on to Kyiv.At one point during their travels, Mr. Giuliani agreed to serve as a lawyer for Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. And during their trips to Ukraine, Mr. Lutsenko helped Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman make contact with powerful Ukrainians. They met with Ukraine's president at the time, Petro O. Poroshenko. And they sipped coffee with a close aide to his successor, Volodymyr Zelensky.But some of what happened is a matter of dispute.Lawyers for Mr. Parnas have said their client offered a White House meeting to Mr. Poroshenko if he announced an investigation into the Bidens. A spokeswoman for Mr. Poroshenko said he ""hasn't conducted any kind of negotiations with Fruman and Parnas.""One of Mr. Parnas's lawyers also has said that his client told the Zelensky aide that without such an announcement, the United States would withhold financial assistance and Vice President Mike Pence would stay home from the Ukrainian inauguration. Mr. Pence ultimately did not attend, and Mr. Trump later froze nearly $400 million in military aid.Mr. Fruman's lawyers and Mr. Giuliani have denied that any quid pro quo was offered. Mr. Trump has denied improperly withholding aid.After Mr. Trump's suspension of the military aid and his July 25 call asking Mr. Zelensky to investigate the Bidens, a whistle-blower's complaint about the president's conduct began to shine a light on Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman.House Democrats soon sought documents and testimony from the men. Mr. Parnas traveled to the Cape Cod home of John Dowd, a lawyer close to the president who would represent him and Mr. Fruman in the impeachment inquiry.A few days later, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman had lunch with Mr. Giuliani in Washington. They were at Dulles International Airport that night when F.B.I. agents arrested them.Their $325,000 contribution to America First Action, federal prosecutors in Manhattan alleged, had been made illegally in the name of Global Energy Producers, a company without any income. Mr. Correia, whose lawyer Jeffrey Marcus declined to comment, was also indicted. All have pleaded not guilty.At the White House, Mr. Trump told reporters he did not know Mr. Parnas or Mr. Fruman. Mr. Parnas, at a detention center in Virginia, soon concluded that Mr. Trump was abandoning him.Mr. Parnas's last moment in Mr. Trump's world came when Mr. Dowd and another lawyer, Kevin Downing, went to see him in jail. During their visit, Mr. Parnas grew angry in part at what he perceived as the president's betrayal, and fired the lawyers in a tirade of expletives, according to people with knowledge of the incident.The lawyers left, and Mr. Parnas began to consider his next move.Reporting was contributed by Sarah Maslin Nir, Maria Varenikova, Maggie Haberman, Michael Schwirtz and Chris Cameron.

| Jump to first hitSteve Ricchetti, one of Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s closest confidantes, is reaching out to wary donors to shore up support. The Biden presidential campaign is watching costs -- some staff members are sleeping at homes of volunteers -- and facing criticism for spending on chartered jets. Mr. Biden's team is also urging allies to redouble fund-raising efforts before the calendar turns to 2020 and he has fewer days to devote to the money trail.And in a confidential memo to top bundlers this week, Mr. Biden's campaign manager, Greg Schultz, sought to allay growing concerns that Mr. Biden is facing a cash crunch and won't be able to stay competitive with his rivals on the airwaves and on the ground.""We will have the resources we need to execute our plan,"" Mr. Schultz wrote in the memo, obtained by The New York Times. But he simultaneously exhorted the money-raisers to do more: ""We're asking you to dig deep.""The Biden campaign and its backers are racing to contain fallout from revelations this month that his campaign is spending more money than it is taking in, unlike his leading rivals. Mr. Biden's cash on hand -- $9 million -- is now only a fraction of what Senators Bernie Sanders ($33.7 million) and Elizabeth Warren ($25.7 million) have banked. He even has less on hand than two candidates, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Kamala Harris, who are well behind him in the polls.On Thursday, the Biden campaign delivered the clearest signal yet that it will do whatever it takes to survive financially, abandoning Mr. Biden's long-held opposition to a super PAC independent of the campaign and clearing the way for donors to give unlimited sums in support of him. Biden advisers cited continuing attacks from President Trump for the reversal.Six months into his candidacy and 100 days until the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Biden is no longer the undisputed Democratic front-runner he once was. He entered the race in April making the case that, as Barack Obama's vice president and a longtime leader with moderate and liberal views, he stood the best chance of uniting the party, attracting voters across racial, gender and ideological lines and winning over swing voters in battleground states.While Mr. Biden still leads in many polls, and many voters still express deep appreciation for him, his financial situation -- the inability to consolidate traditional big-money donors or inspire a sufficiently large online base of small contributors -- has served as a flashing warning sign about the potential limits of his appeal.One rival, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, said pointedly this week that he was ""getting calls from people who are Biden supporters who now want to hedge their bet"" on the former vice president.Ed Rendell, the former Pennsylvania governor and a Biden fund-raiser, acknowledged he had heard the anxieties. ""They're worried when they see only $9 million in the bank, because donors have a tendency to believe the person with the most amount of money wins,"" said Mr. Rendell, who added that he does not share that view.Mr. Schultz, the Biden campaign manager, said in an interview on Friday that Mr. Biden was facing a financial situation unlike any other Democrat: He is taking incoming fire from both the White House and primary opponents on a daily basis, and needs to play both offense and defense within the limits of $2,800 maximum donations.""We can't both do a general election and primary. And no one can,"" Mr. Schultz said. Of his rivals who have denounced the super PAC reversal, he added, ""If they were being attacked with $10 million-plus of outside money in a general election sense, I would love to see what they would do.""Mr. Biden's allies are not only concerned about his fund-raising: There's also the spending. Mr. Biden raised $15.7 million in the third quarter, but he spent $2 million more than that. Among his biggest expenses was more than $920,000 on chartered jets.Terry McAuliffe, the former governor of Virginia and a prolific fund-raiser, said that donors were ""furious"" about the jet spending and called the campaign's overall money situation ""very alarming."" Mr. McAuliffe's wife recently invited donors to attend a fund-raiser for Mr. Biden at their home in early November.Mr. Schultz, when asked about the chartered travel, said that ""whatever maximizes Joe Biden and voter interaction, the greater chance we have to win."" The campaign said Mr. Biden had flown commercial but declined to indicate when his last such flight was.The pressure over money is bound to intensify as the leading Democratic campaigns compete in the early voting states and the extraordinarily expensive media markets of Super Tuesday states like California. Ms. Warren, currently Mr. Biden's top rival, has already reserved $2.3 million more in television ads in the early voting states than he has, according to Advertising Analytics, a media-tracking firm. In the last 30 days, she spent twice as much as Mr. Biden on Facebook ads, while Mr. Buttigieg spent more than three times as much as Mr. Biden, who has begun buying more online ads after he sharply scaled back his digital spending over the summer.Mr. Biden and his advisers wave off any cash concerns, arguing he is already universally known, seen as Mr. Trump's strongest challenger and beloved in a way money cannot buy. Mr. Biden, in an interview set to air Sunday on ""60 Minutes,"" gave a blunt answer about how he would overcome his rivals' cash edge: ""I just flat-out beat them.""More than most candidates, Mr. Biden has cultivated major Democratic bundlers who gather checks from friends and fellow supporters. To that end, Mr. Biden has used the old-fashioned strategy of giving fancy titles to his top bundlers: an ""advocate"" must raise $25,000, a ""protector"" $50,000 and a ""unifier"" $100,000. Perks, which vary by level, include monthly calls with campaign leadership, and invitations to finance committee retreats and forums.Yet Mr. Biden has struggled to line up the vaunted Obama money operation behind him. Of the nearly 800 bundlers who raised at least $50,000 for Mr. Obama's 2012 campaign -- different because it was a presidential re-election, not a crowded primary -- less than a quarter have donated to Mr. Biden so far this year, according to an analysis of Federal Election Commission data. An even smaller share are actively tapping their networks for him.One bright spot is that Mr. Biden's online donations have picked up of late. His best week for raising money since the second week in the race came in late September as the impeachment scandal exploded. Then, in the first half of October, he raised more online than he had raised in all of September, the campaign said.The campaign has employed some sky-is-falling tactics to spur giving, including an email last week threatening ""budget cuts"" if more money did not materialize. ""Low on resources"" was the subject line of a Friday missive. (No cutbacks are planned, the campaign said.)If Mr. Biden's fund-raising does not improve, he could be hard-pressed to ramp up his operations for the primary season. Just to pay for his existing campaign infrastructure through the Iowa caucuses would require the $9 million he has in the bank now plus the full fund-raising haul that he had in the third quarter.In his memo to bundlers, Mr. Schultz outlined ways they were already trying to control costs, including having the headquarters staff stay at the homes of supporters ""whenever it is available.""""Clearly everybody would have liked if the Biden campaign raised more in the last quarter,"" said Joe Falk, a Biden fund-raiser in Florida. But Mr. Falk remained bullish on Mr. Biden's position in the race. ""Given the full frontal assault from the Republicans, the Russian bots and the competitors, his polling numbers are holding up better than expected,"" he said.Despite the competition from two liberals, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, who have rejected the donor class and would be further left than any Democratic nominee in many years, Mr. Biden's team has been unable to fully consolidate support of the Democratic establishment.He has been out-raised in the last two quarters by Mr. Buttigieg, who has won over many former Obama-era ambassadors as a 37-year-old fresh face for the party.Last Monday, Bradley Tusk, who served as a re-election campaign manager for Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City, hosted a fund-raiser for Mr. Buttigieg. According to Mr. Tusk, the crowd was filled with ""a lot of those people you would have thought would be Biden people. And they weren't."" (Attendees included Jon S. Corzine, the former New Jersey governor and Goldman Sachs executive, who had previously attended a Biden event in the Hamptons in the summer.)""The feeling in the room,"" Mr. Tusk said, ""was that Biden has already lost.""Mr. Biden's dependence on donors who have given the $2,800 maximum amount was one reason for the reversal on a super PAC, which provides those donors a new outlet to give even more. Records show that almost 35 percent of the $37.7 million that Mr. Biden has raised so far has come from donors who have given the maximum.""It just means we have to find new people, and the people we have found -- the people who gave $2,800 -- they ought to be able to find a buddy or two buddies,"" said Alan Kessler, a lawyer in Pennsylvania raising money for Mr. Biden.The super PAC reversal ignited swift denunciations from Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, both of whom were running anti-super-PAC ads on Facebook within 24 hours.In addition to whatever the pro-Biden super PAC does, the International Association of Fire Fighters is preparing a pro-Biden campaign of its own, with a six-figure budget of mostly online spending, said Mark Treglio, a spokesman for the union.The need for options like a super PAC reflect the reality that it can be especially hard for a candidate relying on big donors to raise money deeper into a campaign.When Mr. Biden took his campaign's first trip to Southern California in May, he held three fund-raisers where a combined more than 600 people attended. But when he returned in October, he again held three events and drew about half as many people, a bit more than 300.Next week, he is headed to Florida for at least two fund-raisers, according to people familiar with his schedule..Mr. Biden's advisers and allies repeatedly emphasize that while he may not compete dollar for dollar with some rivals -- or even come close -- he is intrinsically different because he is already universally known and widely liked and seen as formidable against Mr. Trump. The word they kept coming back to was ""resilience.""As in, Mr. Biden has suffered through six months of criticism and attacks -- from his rivals, from the news media, from the president -- and remains at or near the top of the national polls.""Any other candidate, it might concern you,"" Mike Collier, a Texas bundler for Mr. Biden who has previously run for office himself, said of the campaign's finances. ""But with someone like Joe, I'm not anywhere near as concerned.""Rachel Shorey, Jonathan Martin and Katie Glueck contributed reporting.PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is dealing with fallout from recent revelations about his campaign's financial picture.

| Jump to first hitAs next debate approaches, Joseph R. Biden's son also said he would not work for foreign-owned companies if his father became president.ALTOONA, Iowa -- Hunter Biden, whose overseas business dealings have drawn relentless attacks from President Trump and posed a threat to the candidacy of his father, Joseph R. Biden Jr., intends to step down from the board of a Chinese company, BHR, by the end of the month, his lawyer said on Sunday, a move his father later lauded in a forceful defense of his son's integrity.The lawyer also said in a statement that if Mr. Biden were to be elected president, his son would ""agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign-owned companies.""The decision is the first action the pro-Biden camp has taken that appears to acknowledge the extent to which Hunter Biden's business practices have created an untenable problem for his father's 2020 campaign. With the fourth Democratic primary debate only two days away, political strategists said Hunter Biden's decision to leave the Chinese company could help defuse the issue at a time when Mr. Biden's lower-polling Democratic rivals have suggested his son's work overseas raises questions about conflict of interest.""Hunter's decision won't stop Trump from spreading debunked conspiracy theories about the past,"" said David Axelrod, President Barack Obama's former chief strategist. ""But it does give Joe Biden an answer he didn't have about potential conflicts of interest moving forward.""In a brief news conference here Sunday in which he repeatedly pounded the podium, Mr. Biden stressed that the decision to leave the Chinese company's board had been his son's alone and suggested he learned of the statement from Hunter Biden's lawyers. He also took what seemed to be veiled swipes at some of Mr. Trump's children, who have had their own overseas business dealings.""The statement my son put out today, which I saw when he put it out -- I was told it was going to be put out, I did not consult with him about what's being put out -- in fact represents the kind of man of integrity he is,"" Mr. Biden said. ""And I can tell you now, if I am your president, next president, I'm going to build on the squeaky-clean transparent environment that we had in the Obama-Biden White House, and no one in my family or associated with me will be involved in any foreign operation whatsoever. Period, end of story.""Minutes later, he appeared to jab more sharply at members of the Trump family, a message that Mr. Biden, a Senate traditionalist who reveres beltway customs and civility, does not typically emphasize.""No one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in on meetings as if they're a Cabinet member, will in fact have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country,"" he said.""No one,"" he said twice, smacking the podium each time, ""has asserted my son did a single thing wrong.""""No one,"" he said, ""has asserted that I have done anything wrong except the lying president. That's the only thing. That's the focus.""There is no evidence Mr. Biden acted improperly to aid his son's overseas financial dealings in China and Ukraine, as Mr. Trump has asserted. Still, many on the Biden team are gravely concerned about the president's ability to inflict damage with a barrage of claims that, while baseless, could nevertheless take hold in voters' views of the race. Some of those claims have been featured in an expansive pro-Trump advertising campaign.Mr. Biden has consistently ranked as one of the Democratic Party's leading presidential candidates. But his advantage has slipped in some recent polls, and his fund-raising has lagged his top rivals. Over the last two weeks he has begun to vigorously fight back against Mr. Trump's criticisms; last week, in a fiery address in New Hampshire, he called for the first time for Mr. Trump to be impeached, a view he expanded on when addressing a gathering of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union Sunday afternoon.""It does have an incredibly negative impact on the state of affairs in the country,"" he said. ""I wish it didn't get there, but it's gotten so far now, if you don't, if you don't move on it, then what do we say to the rest of the world about who we are? What do you say about opening the gates and saying, 'come on in, get involved in our elections?""'The statement on Sunday from Hunter Biden's lawyer, George Mesires, said his client had served only as a member of board of directors of BHR, an equity investment fund manager, ""which he joined based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets."" It was an unpaid position. Mr. Mesires has previously said Hunter Biden became an investor in 2017, taking a 10 percent stake in BHR.The statement had been in the works for weeks, one Biden adviser said. Over the past month, Mr. Biden and his team have at times hesitated about how to respond to Mr. Trump's attacks, and some Democratic operatives and voters have wondered why Mr. Biden and his campaign did not respond more swiftly and comprehensively.His campaign didn't answer several follow-up questions about the younger Mr. Biden's decision, including about why Hunter Biden didn't recuse himself earlier.Mr. Trump has directed his broadsides against Hunter Biden as he faces an impeachment inquiry in the House, which was spurred by the president's entreaties to the government of Ukraine urging the government to investigate Hunter Biden's financial dealings there. Subsequently, Mr. Trump publicly called for China to look into Hunter Biden's financial dealings in that country.Mr. Trump has said with no evidence that the younger Mr. Biden used political ties to induce China to invest $1.5 billion in a fund he was involved in, an assertion Joseph Biden has denied.Aides say Mr. Biden has been bracing for weeks for questions about his son onstage at Tuesday's CNN/New York Times debate. His allies and advisers say that any Democrat who broaches the subject is playing into Mr. Trump's hands and hurting the party's cause, and some have suggested Mr. Biden is prepared to make that case if he faces skepticism over his son's Ukraine dealings from either the moderators or rival Democrats.Mr. Biden, said Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a close Biden ally, is ""not going to be surprised"" by any attacks on the debate stage on Tuesday, even highly personal ones.Still, some Democrats say the national focus on Mr. Biden's family has become a political vulnerability, moving him off his campaign message and forcing him to play defense.""It becomes a distraction, and that's what hurt Hillary Clinton in 2016,"" said Bret Nilles, the Democratic Party chairman in Linn County, Iowa, alluding to the scrutiny of Mrs. Clinton's email practices while she was secretary of state.The Biden campaign's approach has been to push back firmly on Mr. Trump's claims through an aggressive media strategy, and to argue that the president is attacking Mr. Biden because he is concerned about running against him in a general election.""They can also say, for Democrats who are nervous about it, 'Hunter's taken a step to say he won't be on these boards if the vice president is elected president,' and they could say, 'we've addressed it and it's time to move on,""' said Jennifer Palmieri, who was Mrs. Clinton's communications director in the 2016 presidential campaign. ""There are these campaign rituals you have to go through when your campaign does hit a perilous patch like this in order to signal to the press you're handling it right, and to reassure supporters.""Mr. Biden sought to take that tack with reporters Sunday, repeatedly seeking to direct attention back to Mr. Trump's behavior.Mr. Biden also began his remarks at the union gathering by praising Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., for a morning television appearance where he defended ""me and my family against these outrageous, lying ads"" from Mr. Trump.The last few weeks have been a challenging time for Mr. Biden, aides and allies have said. The Biden family, which is close-knit, has endured painful losses over the years, including the death in 2015 of Mr. Biden's elder son Beau Biden; Hunter Biden is the former vice president's only surviving son.In the weeks since news broke that Mr. Trump urged the Ukrainians to look into Mr. Biden's family, he has held only a handful of public events, spending significant time at fund-raisers as the third quarter of the year drew to a close. He finished the quarter having raised about $10 million less than his two top rivals, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.Mr. Biden has also toggled between responding sharply to Mr. Trump and pivoting back to policy, though he has ramped up his criticisms of Mr. Trump forcefully in recent weeks, and is expected to make the president a major focus of his debate appearance on Tuesday, a Biden adviser said.Jonathan Martin and Laura Holson contributed reporting.PhotographHunter Biden plans to resign from the board of the Chinese equity investment fund manager BHR by the end of the month.

| Jump to first hitSigns that the president's advantage in the Electoral College has persisted or even increased since 2016.Despite low national approval ratings and the specter of impeachment, President Trump remains highly competitive in the battleground states likeliest to decide his re-election, according to a set of new surveys from The New York Times Upshot and Siena College.Across the six closest states that went Republican in 2016, he trails Joe Biden by an average of two points among registered voters but stays within the margin of error.Mr. Trump leads Elizabeth Warren by two points among registered voters, the same margin as his win over Hillary Clinton in these states three years ago.The poll showed Bernie Sanders deadlocked with the president among registered voters, but trailing among likely voters.The results suggest that Ms. Warren, who has emerged as a front-runner for the Democratic nomination, might face a number of obstacles in her pursuit of the presidency. The poll supports concerns among some Democrats that her ideology and gender -- including the fraught question of ""likability"" -- could hobble her candidacy among a crucial sliver of the electorate. And not only does she underperform her rivals, but the poll also suggests that the race could be close enough for the difference to be decisive.In national polls, Mr. Trump's political standing has appeared to be in grave jeopardy. His approval ratings have long been in the low 40s, and he trails Mr. Biden by almost nine points in a national polling average. But as the 2016 race showed, the story in the battleground states can be quite different. Mr. Trump won the election by sweeping Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina -- even while losing the national vote by two points.Democrats would probably need to win three of the six states to win the White House, assuming other states voted as they did in 2016 -- an outcome that is not at all assured.The Times/Siena results and other data suggest that the president's advantage in the Electoral College relative to the nation as a whole remains intact or has even grown since 2016, raising the possibility that the Republicans could -- for the third time in the past six elections -- win the presidency while losing the popular vote.There is a full year before Election Day, and a lot can change. Ms. Warren is an energetic campaigner. She could moderate her image or motivate young and nonwhite voters, including the millions who might not yet even be included in a poll of today's registered voters. Mr. Biden could lose the relatively conservative voters who currently back him; the president could be dealt irreparable political damage during the impeachment process.But on average over the last three cycles, head-to-head polls a year ahead of the election have been as close to the final result as those taken the day before. The stability of the president's approval rating is a reason to think this pattern might hold again for a fourth cycle, at least for the three leading and already well-known Democrats tested in these polls.While Mr. Biden ranks as the strongest Democrat in the swing states polled, the findings are not necessarily great news for him, either. His appeal to Democrats hinges on the view that he's a safe bet against the president, yet his lead against Mr. Trump is not nearly so comfortable that he could be considered a sure thing.The Times/Siena polls depict an exceptionally energized and polarized electorate that remains divided along the lines of the 2016 presidential election. More than 90 percent of registered voters say they're ""almost certain"" or ""very likely to vote,"" exceeding the 87 percent who said the same thing in Times/Siena polls conducted in the final weeks of the 2016 election.Three years later, more than 90 percent of Mr. Trump's supporters from 2016 approve of his performance, while more than 90 percent of Mrs. Clinton's voters disapprove.The major demographic cleavages of the 2016 election also remain intact. Mr. Trump struggles badly among college-educated white voters and nonwhite voters, though there are signs his standing among the latter group has improved modestly since the last presidential election. He counters with a wide lead among white voters who did not graduate from a four-year college.In contrast to recent national surveys, the Times/Siena polls find that the president's lead among white, working-class voters nearly matches his decisive advantage from 2016. This group represents nearly half of registered voters in these states, and a majority in the Northern battlegrounds that decided the last election.The poll offers little evidence that any Democrat, including Mr. Biden, has made substantial progress toward winning back the white working-class voters who defected to the president in 2016, at least so far. All the leading Democratic candidates trail in the precincts or counties that voted for Barack Obama and then flipped to Mr. Trump.As a result, Democrats appear to have made little progress in reclaiming their traditional advantage in the Northern battleground states, despite their sweep there in the 2018 midterms. Respondents in these states said they voted for Democratic congressional candidates by an average of six points, all but identical to their actual winning margins.Nearly two-thirds of the Trump voters who said they voted for Democratic congressional candidates in 2018 say that they'll back the president against all three named opponents.Nonetheless, Mr. Biden holds the edge among both registered voters and likely voters, and even among those who cast a ballot in 2016. He has a lead of 55 percent to 22 percent among voters who say they supported minor-party candidates like Gary Johnson and Jill Stein, and among those who say they voted but left the 2016 presidential race blank. It comes on top of a slight shift -- just two points in Mr. Biden's favor -- among those who say they voted for either Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Trump.Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, on the other hand, lose a sliver of Mrs. Clinton's vote and make fewer inroads among Mr. Trump's supporters.The wide spread between the three candidates might be a surprise. But even in today's polarized era, 21 percent of registered voters don't simply line up for Mr. Trump or his Democratic opponents in the three head-to-head matchups. This includes 6 percent of the electorate that currently supports Mr. Biden against Mr. Trump but not Ms. Warren against Mr. Trump. There is also 3 percent of the electorate currently willing to support Ms. Warren but not Mr. Biden. And then there are the voters who are undecided in either matchup.In states likely to be closely fought, even a modest swing among these voters could resolve the election in either side's favor. In this poll, they swing the election in favor of Mr. Biden but leave Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders short.Ms. Warren's challenge is not just name recognition. She also underperformed her rivals against Mr. Trump in separate head-to-head polling of Iowa, where she and other candidates have been campaigning in earnest ahead of the Democratic caucus.Ms. Warren trailed Mr. Trump by six points in Iowa, the widest gap among leading Democrats, even though she led the Democratic caucus in our poll. Pete Buttigieg, who is generally not as well known as Ms. Warren, trailed Mr. Trump by four points in Iowa, which was the only state where we included him in head-to-head polling against the president. Mr. Biden trailed by one point and Mr. Sanders by three.An analysis of the 205 respondents from the six core battleground states who support Mr. Biden but not Ms. Warren suggests that she might struggle to win many of them over.Over all, 26 percent of these voters say they have a favorable view of Ms. Warren, compared with 47 percent who have an unfavorable view.They say, by a margin of 74 percent to 24 percent, that they would prefer a more moderate Democrat nominee to a more liberal one. By a nearly identical margin, they would prefer a Democrat who promises to find common ground with Republicans over one who promises to fight for a bold progressive agenda.Of voters who support Mr. Biden but not Ms. Warren, 52 percent agree with the statement that Ms. Warren is too far to the left for them to feel comfortable supporting her for president, while 26 percent disagree.The Biden voters who say Ms. Warren is too far to the left are relatively well educated and disproportionately reside in precincts that flipped from Mitt Romney in 2012 to Mrs. Clinton four years later. They oppose single-payer health care or free college, and they support the Republicans' 2017 tax law. They are not natural Democratic voters: 41 percent consider themselves conservative; 20 percent say they're Republican; 33 percent supported Mr. Trump or Mr. Johnson in 2016.Dawn Marshall, an independent from Tampa, Fla., said that with the exception of Mr. Biden, the Democrats running for president are too left-leaning for her.""They want to be socialists, and this is not a socialistic country,"" she said. ""This is a working country where people go out, do the best that they can do, find jobs. I am so sick and tired of having to support other folks. We can't be equal.""Ms. Marshall, a telecom engineer who is black and Native American, would not seem to be representative of her demographic group. Yet nonwhite Biden supporters are likelier than white Biden voters to say they would choose Mr. Trump over Ms. Warren.At the same time, 41 percent of the voters who support Mr. Biden but not Ms. Warren say they agree with the statement that most of the women who run for president ""just aren't that likable,"" likely bolstering concerns among some Democrats that sexism could be a burden on her candidacy.These Biden supporters are disproportionately male and working class. This group holds a variety of conservative views on cultural issues: 55 percent agree that discrimination against whites has become as big a problem as discrimination against minorities; 79 percent agree that political correctness has gone too far; 54 percent would reduce legal immigration.Some women also fall into this group. Elysha Savarese, 26, works in victims advocacy in Florida. She voted for Mr. Trump and said she would not do so again.But she wouldn't vote for Ms. Warren, either.""There's just something about her that I just don't like,"" she said. ""I just don't feel like she's a genuine candidate. I find her body language to be very off-putting. She's very cold. She's basically a Hillary Clinton clone.""As for female presidential candidates in general, she said, ""They're super unlikable.""The poll does show a natural area of potential growth for Ms. Warren: the 32 percent of Biden-but-not-Warren voters who do not agree that most female presidential candidates are unlikable or that Ms. Warren is too far to the left.These voters like Mr. Biden -- he has a 92 percent favorable rating among them -- but 52 percent say they don't know enough about Ms. Warren to have an opinion. Fifty-nine percent are nonwhite. Mr. Sanders has a wide lead against the president among these voters.If these respondents had backed Ms. Warren in the Times/Siena survey, the poll results would have shown her and Mr. Trump deadlocked in an election highly reminiscent of 2016.Claire Cain Miller contributed reporting.The Times/Siena poll of 3,766 registered voters was conducted from Oct. 13 to Oct. 26. The margin of sampling error for an individual state poll is plus or minus 4.4, except for Michigan at plus or minus 5.1 points. Together, the battleground sample has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.8 percentage points.The Times/Siena poll of 1,435 registered voters in Iowa was conducted from Oct. 25 to Oct. 30 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.Full cross-tabs and methodology are available here.In 2018, the Times/Siena polls had an average error of 2.5 points in 10 polls in these states over the final three weeks of the campaign. If they had been joined together as one large poll, as is the case here, the final result would have been within 1 point.Photograph(A15)Word count: 2006Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hitHouse investigators on Tuesday released transcripts from two more closed-door depositions.The House committees leading the impeachment inquiry on Tuesday released transcripts from two more closed-door depositions as the proceedings move to a more public phase.The transcripts include witness testimony from two figures central to the inquiry, Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt D. Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine. Reporters from The New York Times combed through the documents and highlighted key parts, offering context and analysis.Sondland told a Ukrainian official that more than an Oval Office meeting was at stake unless the Ukrainians announced the investigations that Trump sought.Volker transcript, in text messages released with his testimony, Page 403: ""Drove the 'larger issue' home with Yermak. Not about just a meeting but the relationship per se.""By mid-August, the American officials were trying to impress upon Ukrainian officials the need for them to publicly announce investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., one of President Trump's political rivals, and into a conspiracy theory that Ukraine worked against Mr. Trump in the 2016 election.In this Aug. 19 text message to another American diplomat, Mr. Sondland wrote that he told Andriy Yermak, a top Ukrainian aide, that an Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine was not all that hung in the balance. The larger ""relationship"" between Ukraine and the United States was also at risk, he implied. The Ukrainians wanted the Oval Office meeting to bolster Mr. Zelensky's credibility. But even more important, they wanted the White House to release its hold on $391 million in military assistance to help Ukraine fight pro-Russians forces waging a separatist war in eastern Ukraine. 
-- Sharon LaFraniereSondland said he received a misleading description of the July call between Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart.Sondland transcript, Page 251: ""I think the only readouts I remember seeing were the ones from my team, which were very innocuous, and did not represent what was actually said on the call that I found out once the transcript was a released.""Even though he was dealing directly with the Ukrainian government to set up a meeting between the two presidents, Mr. Sondland said he was never given a readout of the telephone call between President Trump and Mr. Zelensky, which would have been customary for someone in his position.Other diplomats dealing with Ukraine were also left in the dark. When the White House publicly released the transcript on Sept. 25, they were stunned to learn what Mr. Trump had said.
-- Lara JakesTrump complained Ukraine was trying to take him down.Volker transcript, Page 31: ""He gave the example of hearing from Rudy Giuliani that they're all corrupt, they're all terrible people, that they were -- they tried to take me down -- meaning the president in the 2016 election.""Mr. Volker told impeachment investigators that Mr. Trump dismissed their positive assessments of Ukraine during a May 23 meeting at the White House because of what he was hearing from his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani.That story was echoed by Mr. Sondland, who told investigators that he had also heard Mr. Trump make a remark about believing that Ukraine wanted to take him down.
-- Michael D. ShearSondland cast doubt upon accounts that he had linked Mulvaney to a quid-pro-quo scheme.Sondland transcript, Page 221: ""I don't recall ever having a conversation with Mr. Mulvaney about that. I honestly don't. I've had very, very few conversations with Mr. Mulvaney.""Investigators were asking Mr. Sondland about a July 10 meeting with two senior Ukrainian officials in the White House office of John R. Bolton, then the national security adviser. At least one witness has testified that at that meeting, Mr. Sondland blurted out that the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, had promised an Oval Office invitation to the new Ukrainian president if the Ukrainians announced the sought-after investigations. That would appear to draw Mr. Mulvaney into the scandal.Questioned repeatedly on that point, Mr. Sondland said that he did not think he ever secured such a guarantee from Mr. Mulvaney and that he did not remember saying that in the meeting. 
-- Sharon LaFraniereAfter the July call, Volker learned the U.S. had never formally requested that Ukraine open an inquiry into possible interference in the 2016 election.Volker transcript, Page 197: ""Q Did you speak with anyone at D.O.J. about whether the U.S. had requested an official investigation?A No, I did not. I did ask -- I did ask our Charge to also check. And I later understood that we never had. And because of that was another factor in my advising the Ukrainians then don't put it in now.A You told the Ukrainians don't put it in the specific investigation?A Yes, yes.A Did you speak with the Ukrainians about whether or not the U.S. had ever requested an official investigation?A It came up in this conversation with Andriy about the statement, and he asked whether we ever had. I didn't know the answer. That's why I wanted to go back and find out. As I found out the answer that we had not, I said, 'We11, 1et's just not go there.""'When Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky spoke on July 25, Mr. Trump said he wanted Attorney General William P. Barr to talk to Mr. Zelensky or someone on his staff about investigating Ukraine's involvement in trying to influence the 2016 presidential election to benefit the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, a far-right theory that has never been corroborated. When Mr. Volker was working on a draft statement with one of Mr. Zelensky's aides a couple of weeks later, Mr. Volker learned that the Justice Department never made a formal request to Ukraine to do such an investigation, which is the standard protocol.Both Mr. Volker and Mr. Zelensky's aide, Mr. Yermak, agreed that because there was no official request from the Justice Department, it was best to leave out of any statement Mr. Zelensky would make about Ukrainian relations with the United States, further underscoring the separate foreign policy campaign Mr. Giuliani was trying to advance on behalf of Mr. Trump. 
-- Eileen SullivanDays before the July 25 call, Volker warned Giuliani that the Biden-Ukraine narrative was not credible.Volker transcript, Page 203: ""And I said to Rudy in that breakfast the first time we sat down to talk that it is simply not credible to me that Joe Biden would be influenced in his duties as vice president by money or things for his son or anything like that. I've known him a long time, he's a person of integrity, and that's not credible.""According to Mr. Volker, he had breakfast with Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Giuliani's associate Lev Parnas at the Trump Hotel six days before the phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky. During their meeting, Mr. Volker tried to convince Mr. Giuliani that the allegations against Mr. Biden and his younger son, Hunter Biden, were not credible. Mr. Volker said he tried to explain to Mr. Giuliani that if Ukraine wanted to investigate possible corruption in one of its companies, Burisma Holdings, that was one thing, but Mr. Volker said he tried to warn Mr. Giuliani not to tie it to the Bidens because it would be seen as political. 
-- Eileen SullivanIn early July, Volker and Zelensky suggested that Giuliani's involvement in Ukraine affairs was a problem.Volker transcript, Page 138: ""The negative narrative about Ukraine which Mr. Giuliani was furthering was the problem. It was, in my view, it was impeding our ability to build the relationship the way we should be doing.""Mr. Volker and Mr. Zelensky met in Toronto on July 3, a few weeks before the phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry. By Mr. Volker's account, he and Mr. Zelensky discussed the problem that Mr. Giuliani was causing by pushing a negative narrative about Ukraine's corruption as Mr. Zelensky was working to introduce his reform agenda. This shows that during the July 25 phone call, when Mr. Trump suggested that Mr. Zelensky work with Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Zelensky was well-aware of what the president's personal lawyer was doing. 
-- Eileen SullivanThe top U.S. diplomat in Kiev hesitated about taking the job partly because of the influence of Giuliani.Volker transcript, in text messages released with his testimony, Page 386: ""I am still struggling with the decision whether to go. Can anyone hope to succeed with the Giuliani/Biden issue swirling for the next 18 months?"" Mr. Taylor said in text messages.Later Mr. Taylor asked, ""Do I want to enter this non-normal world?""William B. Taylor Jr., now the top American diplomat in Kiev, sent this message to Mr. Volker on May 26, before agreeing to succeed Marie. L. Yovanovitch, who was ousted as the American ambassador to Ukraine. He specifically mentioned Mr. Giuliani in the context of ""Biden."" This appears to be a reference to Mr. Giuliani's claims, echoed by President Trump, that as vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr. tried to squash a criminal inquiry of a Ukrainian company that had hired Mr. Biden's son as a board member. No evidence has surfaced to support those claims. Mr. Taylor was also worried about the lack of a normal chain of command. 
-- Sharon LaFraniereThe July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky was scheduled after Giuliani got on board.Volker testimony, Page 276: ""Orchestrated a great phone call with Rudy and Yermak,"" Mr. Volker texted another diplomat on July 22. ""Rudy is now advocating for a phone call.""This appears to show how, for the Ukrainians, the route to Mr. Trump ran through Mr. Giuliani. Some of Mr. Trump's official advisers, including Mr. Bolton, were against scheduling a July call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky.Mr. Bolton specifically warned it could be ""a disaster,"" according to another congressional witness. Mr. Volker and other aides had been pushing for it. After he connected Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Yermak, a top aide to Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Giuliani agreed to the call, Mr. Volker said. It took place three days later. 
-- Sharon LaFraniereWhite House lawyers called Sondland hours before whistle-blower report was made public.Sondland transcript, Page 38: ""I had a brief conversation with the White House Counsel's Office when the whistle-blower's report came out mentioning my name, and the White House Counsel's Office reached me, I was in New York at the United Nation Trans-Atlantic dinner. I stepped out of the meeting to take the call.""Mr. Sondland told House investigators that the White House Counsel's Office gave him a head's up a few hours before the public release of the whistle-blower's report about Mr. Trump's telephone call with the president of Ukraine. Michael Purpura, a White House lawyer, reached him by phone a few hours later, asking Mr. Sondland to come in for an interview since his name was mentioned in the document. Mr. Sondland told investigators that he did not agree to the interview with White House lawyers. 
-- Michael D. ShearA top national security adviser was 'shaking' in anger over what she saw as dysfunction at the White House.Sondland transcript, Page 266: ""And she [Fiona Hill] was pretty upset about her role in the administration, about her superiors, about the president. She was sort of shaking. She was pretty mad.""Sondland transcript, Page 267: ""She's usually pretty calm, collected, straightforward, but she was pretty emotional.""Fiona Hill, a Russia scholar, was a top foreign policy adviser to Mr. Trump before she resigned on July 19 -- days before the telephone call between the president and Mr. Zelensky. Over a cup of coffee with Mr. Sondland a few days before she left, Ms. Hill specifically criticized Mr. Trump and Mr. Bolton.Mr. Sondland recounted to House investigators that Ms. Hill said the National Security Council was not well run, and said she described disorder and communications problems in the Trump administration. He described a cordial working relationship with Ms. Hill and said their 15-to-20 minute meeting ended with a hug.Ms. Hill has told investigators that she believed Mr. Sondland was too inexperienced for his post as ambassador to the European Union, and therefore was a counterintelligence risk. 
-- Lara JakesSondland claimed to be oblivious to Giuliani's real goals.Sondland transcript, Page 70: ""I became aware of his interest in Burisma sometime in the intervening period, but I never made the connection between Burisma and the Bidens until the very end. That is my testimony. I heard the word 'Burisma,' but I didn't understand that Biden and Burisma were connected.""In a tense exchange with House investigators during his interview, Mr. Sondland repeatedly insisted that he had no idea Mr. Giuliani's real interest in pressing Ukraine for an investigation of Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his family, including Burisma, the energy company that had put Hunter Biden on its board.In the transcript of his interview, investigators appeared to grow increasingly incredulous as they presented Mr. Sondland with news media appearances and social media posts by Mr. Giuliani in which he described his intentions. At one point, the lawyer questioning Mr. Sondland asked, ""You were completely oblivious to Rudy Giuliani's interest in Burisma because it involved the Bidens?""""I never made the connection between Burisma and the Bidens until the very end,"" Mr. Sondland replied. ""That is my testimony.""-- Michael D. ShearPhotographKurt Volker, the former State Department envoy to Ukraine, leaving Capitol Hill after testifying to impeachment investigators last month.

| Jump to first hitJoseph R. Biden Jr. has durable support from a multiracial coalition of working-class voters who view him as one of their own.WEST POINT, Iowa -- They are white and nonwhite alike, prefer Facebook over Twitter, if they are on social media at all, and can be hard to find at Democratic campaign events dominated by activists from the professional class. But these blue-collar voters could go a long way toward determining who captures the Democratic presidential nomination -- and Joseph R. Biden Jr. is racing to press his advantage with that constituency.With less than three months to go before voting begins in the 2020 primary, and on the eve of the fifth presidential primary debate, Mr. Biden faces significant challenges in the key early states of Iowa and New Hampshire, a cash crunch and several Democrats threatening his standing with centrist voters.But his greatest compensating advantage right now is notably durable support from a multiracial coalition of working-class voters who feel a kinship with the former vice president and believe he is the Democrats' strongest general election prospect.At fund-raisers and on campaign stops, Mr. Biden is warning his party against overlooking voters who were once a core Democratic constituency but had found some elements of President Trump's message compelling in 2016. His campaign believes the Democratic Party risks narrowing its Electoral College path in 2020, and hurting its standing on Capitol Hill, if candidates do not appeal directly to these more moderate voters in battleground states in the Midwest and Sun Belt.And both explicitly and more subtly, Mr. Biden is portraying his chief rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and another top candidate, Senator Bernie Sanders, as liberals who are overly focused on expensive and theoretical government overhauls.""Growing up in a middle-class neighborhood, the last thing I liked is people telling my family and me what we should know, what we should believe,"" Mr. Biden said as he criticized Ms. Warren's advocacy style, speaking at a recent CNN town hall in Iowa. ""As if somehow we weren't informed, that we -- just because we didn't have money we weren't knowledgeable. I resent that.""Ms. Warren, who is running as a corruption-battling economic populist, surpassed Mr. Biden in a number of polls this fall, and she is often the favorite of white, college-educated voters -- but Mr. Biden still leads comfortably with high school-educated Democrats in many surveys. That dynamic has stymied Ms. Warren's growth after her early-autumn surge, and it has sometimes benefited Mr. Sanders, who also has strong connections to blue-collar voters.In dozens of interviews, from parades and union rallies to black churches and political picnics, working-class Democrats who support Mr. Biden explained their views in practical terms: they know and trust the Scranton native from his long tenure as a Delaware senator and as Barack Obama's vice president, they find his incremental policy proposals realistic and they think he can win.""I liked what him and Barack did together,"" said Doris Stuekerjuergen, who worked at a fireplace factory and attended an October event with Mr. Biden in this small rural community of West Point. ""Hopefully he leads us back to where we were. The world we live in now is pretty scary.""The Democrat who forges a cross-racial coalition of working-class voters almost always wins the party's presidential nomination. It is a path that was disrupted only in 2008 when Mr. Obama was able to achieve what few of his predecessors had -- fuse the support of upscale whites with black Democrats.But surveys in this race indicate a return to the longstanding tradition in Democratic primaries of voters splitting along class lines, and illuminate a key slice of Mr. Biden's base.A recent New York Times/Siena College poll of Democratic primary voters in general election battleground states found that among white voters without a four-year degree, Mr. Biden had double the support -- 30 percent -- of Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. But the numbers for Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren were nearly reversed among white college graduates. In Iowa, where Mr. Biden is struggling, he was still the strong favorite of voters who did not go past high school in another recent New York Times/Siena College poll of likely Democratic caucusgoers.And in South Carolina, where the Democratic electorate is dominated by black voters and where Mr. Biden is strong across the board, a Monmouth University poll from late last month showed him receiving the support of 38 percent of voters without college degrees, well ahead of his rivals.""He is the only candidate right now that I feel can beat Trump,"" said Ivie Barnwell, who stood in the shade selling her handmade sweetgrass baskets in Galivants Ferry, S.C. Around her, T-shirt-clad activists and a host of presidential candidates descended on the town for a political festival earlier this fall. ""This Trump man has got to go,"" she said.For some voters, Mr. Biden appeals because there are strategic assumptions at work: many black working-class Democrats believe that white America will only support a well-known white male, such as Mr. Biden, while a number of working-class white Democrats also believe he is the most acceptable nominee. Some voters cited the misogyny and racism that female candidates and candidates of color have experienced in previous races.And then there is the crucial fact that many of these voters -- whether because of his down-to-earth persona, the tragedies he has endured or a combination of both -- simply have warm feelings for the man they often address as Joe when they see him.""He relates well to blue-collar voters and to non-college voters,"" Jeff Link, a veteran Iowa Democratic strategist, said. ""Those Scranton roots kind of come through.""Despite this advantage, some Democrats are skeptical that Mr. Biden, who turns 77 on Wednesday, can sustain this support.Since he entered the race in April, Mr. Biden's poll numbers have dipped, he has suffered from a series of self-inflicted errors that raised concerns about his age, and he has absorbed ferocious attacks from Democrats and Republicans alike -- including baseless attacks on his family from Mr. Trump.Ty Livesay, the operations manager at a mall in Conway, S.C., said he connected with Mr. Biden -- ""I'm a common Joe, he's a common Joe"" -- but acknowledged having doubts about Mr. Biden's strength in the primary. ""Is Joe going to be able to handle it?"" he asked.Others harbor no such reservations.""I don't care about his personal opinion, gaffes or comments he makes -- what means most to me is what type of man he is,"" said Pete Garrett, who works at an auto parts production company and wore an Obama campaign pin to a Biden appearance in Birmingham, Ala.For all of his advantages with blue-collar voters in the Democratic primary, Mr. Biden so far does not appear to significantly cut into Mr. Trump's base of white working-class voters. And he is not the only Democratic candidate perceived as electable. Early polls, which are parsed by some committed voters but are not predictive at this stage, show several Democrats beating Mr. Trump in head-to-head matchups.Still, Mr. Biden's rivals recognize the advantage he has built up with blue-collar voters and are seeking their own inroads with them.Even as she has unveiled a lengthy roster of detailed policy plans that thrill college-educated liberals, Ms. Warren, for example, also highlights her modest Oklahoma roots, her brothers' military service and her own time as a teacher.Mr. Sanders also enjoys a blue-collar following, polls show. While the most politically muscular element of the Democratic working-class -- the labor unions -- has largely remained on the sideline, after feeling regret over their early intervention on behalf of Hillary Clinton in 2016, Mr. Sanders has recently notched some endorsements. They include the country's biggest nurses' union and a teachers' union in Los Angeles. Senator Kamala Harris, who is struggling in the polls, was endorsed by the United Farm Workers.Mr. Sanders in particular is sitting on voters Mr. Biden could use, especially if Ms. Warren continues to make gains with college-educated Democrats -- though she increasingly faces competition for those voters from Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.One union that does support Mr. Biden is the International Association of Fire Fighters. And that union's president, Harold Schaitberger, said Democrats should be wary of again losing some of the voters who sided with Mr. Trump in 2016.Mr. Schaitberger said these voters want to feel ""that they are connected with someone who wants to be president of the United States but isn't, if you will, looking down on them or preaching down to them.""Asked whether he meant those remarks as a swipe at any of Mr. Biden's opponents, Mr. Schaitberger, himself a high-school educated voter, demurred. But he noted that ""there are some candidates that, you know, speak in a very high intellectual, professorial"" fashion.Ms. Warren is a former Harvard professor.Mr. Biden has also scolded Democrats over their drift from bread-and-butter issues like wages, pensions and union rights.""I bet some of you voted for Donald Trump because we stopped talking to you,"" he said at a campaign stop in Newton, Iowa, over the summer, adding, ""We sort of stopped talking to our base: high school-educated Americans.""Mr. Biden's research has indicated that such voters respond particularly well when reminded of Mr. Biden's middle-class youth as a car dealer's son and that he had lost his first wife and daughter in a car accident and his elder son to brain cancer. He made his biography central to his initial advertising, linking his support for the Affordable Care Act to his searing family story.Steve Buchmeier, a 54-year-old farmer from Kellogg, Iowa, has seen Mr. Biden's campaign ads, and he was one of the Obama-Trump voters in attendance at Mr. Biden's campaign stop in Newton.""The U.S. isn't ready for a girl,"" he said as he reflected on the 2016 election, stressing that his own decisions are not influenced by gender.This time around, Mr. Buchmeier said, he found Mr. Biden's experience as vice president impressive, though he was not committed to switching back to the Democrats in 2020.But, he said, ""this guy is on the top of my list if I do.""PhotographJoseph R. Biden Jr. with supporters in Des Moines this fall. Many working-class voters see him as the Democrats' most electable presidential candidate.

| Jump to first hitMs. Warren said ""complacency does not win elections,"" as she pushed for big changes, while moderates like Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden vowed they could unite the country.DES MOINES -- Displaying a new assertiveness toward her Democratic opponents, Elizabeth Warren laced into her chief political rivals, warning on Friday night that the country was in a ""time of crisis"" and arguing that Democrats would lose in 2020 if they nominated ""anyone who comes on this stage and tells you they can make change without a fight.""Speaking to thunderous applause during the party's biggest Iowa political event of the year, Ms. Warren denounced candidates in the presidential race who opposed bold ideas in favor of more moderate solutions, in veiled attacks on Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Pete Buttigieg.""Complacency does not win elections,"" she said at the Iowa Democratic Party's fund-raising dinner. ""Hope and courage do not win elections. I'm not running some consultant-driven campaign with some vague ideas that are designed not to offend anyone.""Befitting her front-runner status, Ms. Warren was the target of heated attacks from three of the first five speakers on the stage: Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg and Kamala Harris. None of the candidates mentioned one another by name, though Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg both presented themselves as more capable of uniting the country.""We will fight when we must fight but I will never allow us to get so wrapped up in the fighting that we start to think that fighting is the point,"" Mr. Buttigieg said.Mr. Biden, who spoke directly after Mr. Buttigieg, extended the theme, saying, ""If you can't bring the country together we're in real, real, real trouble.""Even Ms. Harris, whose campaign is lagging to the point that she may not qualify for the party's December debate, attacked Ms. Warren personally for the first time.""I've only had one client in my life -- the people,"" Ms. Harris said of her career as a prosecutor. ""Unlike others, I've never represented a corporation.""The sharp exchanges underscored the urgency motivating the candidates as the race enters its final phase ahead of the Iowa caucuses three months from now.The dinner occurred on one of the most consequential days of the race so far, with Ms. Warren, under pressure from other candidates over how she would pay for ""Medicare for all,"" finally introducing a long-awaited, $20.5 trillion proposal that immediately drew a fierce attack from her chief rival, Mr. Biden.Mr. Biden declared that under his health care plan, there would be ""no increase in taxes for the middle class. None, none, none,"" a shot at Ms. Warren's delay in articulating whether such taxpayers would see tax increases. Instead, Mr. Biden promised an opportunity to ""buy into a Medicare-like proposal.""The Biden, Buttigieg and Warren campaigns each bought large sections of the 16,000-seat Wells Fargo Arena here for supporters to cheer on their candidates. Mr. Buttigieg's section was particularly enthusiastic, clapping thundersticks and waving flashing lights throughout his address. Ms. Warren's fans were also spirited, unfurling a banner during her speech with the words, ""Win with Warren.""Mr. Sanders, while speaking at the event, brought no supporters, electing to lead them in a march outside instead, part of a pattern of the independent senator's antipathy toward Democratic Party functions.At the same time, the candidates have been wooing voters with bus tours, rallies and town hall-style events. Ms. Harris, the California senator who is trying to revive her campaign, has taken to cooking Sunday night dinners in supporters' homes and plans to spend Thanksgiving in the state.The surge in attention on Iowa coincides with a more contentious phase of the race, marked by aggressive campaigning and an increased willingness to go on the offensive.Mr. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, and Mr. Biden, the former vice president, have resumed their attacks on each other, with back-and-forth sniping in the last week about Medicare for all and super PACs. Mr. Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar have shown an increased willingness to go after Ms. Warren, the senator from Massachusetts.Hours before the dinner was to begin, Former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas announced the end of his presidential campaign. His departure was so sudden that supporters had already planted scores of his signature black-and-white campaign signs outside the arena.Lower-tier candidates looking to energize their campaigns have also been more pugnacious: Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, for instance, has amped up her criticisms of the Democratic National Committee, the news media and even Hillary Clinton, who is not in the race.But nowhere has the battle been more intense than at the event on Friday, with candidates trading barbs less on specific policies, and more on political ideology.""We need big ideas, and here's the critical part: We need to be willing to fight for them,"" Ms. Warren said. ""It's easy to give up on a big idea, but when we give up on big ideas, we give up on the people whose lives would be touched by those ideas.""Of the top-tier candidates, only Mr. Sanders -- the sole candidate to stand stationary and speak from note on a lectern -- did not attack his opponents, instead delivering a version of his standard stump speech that championed the working class and took aim at corporate interests and the rich. He quoted Franklin D. Roosevelt and Nelson Mandela and provided please for his signature policy proposals, including Medicare for all and tuition-free public college.He also announced his campaign was donating $20,000 to the Iowa Democratic Party in a symbolic show of solidarity even as he continues to eschew traditional party politicking.The crowded and diverse field -- there are still 17 candidates -- has proved challenging for contenders outside the top tier. While nine have qualified for the party's November debate in Atlanta, just four are guaranteed a spot for the December debate in Los Angeles.A poll taken this week of likely caucusgoers by The New York Times and Siena College shows the top four candidates locked in an extraordinarily tight race. Ms. Warren held a narrow advantage, with the support of 22 percent of voters, while Mr. Sanders drew 19 percent and Mr. Buttigieg 18 percent. Mr. Biden, who entered the race as a front-runner, had the backing of 17 percent of likely caucusgoers, much weaker than his position in national polls.For Democrats who had been inclined to support Mr. Biden but now find themselves shopping around, that means the moderate choices are limited to Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and Ms. Klobuchar, the senator from Minnesota, with other would-be options like Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey falling out of the conversation.Susan Swift, a 58-year-old yoga teacher from Dubuque, said at a Biden event Wednesday that even after watching nine months of campaigning she was still trying to decipher the field.Ms. Swift said she liked the former vice president for ""his experience,"" but had become more impressed with Mr. Buttigieg the more she had seen him.""Did you see the pluck that that guy had in the last debate?"" she said. ""Seriously? I was like, 'You just won my heart.""'Conversations this week with 24 of Iowa's 99 Democratic county leaders revealed moderate Democrats moving from Mr. Biden toward Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, who the county officials said had benefited from strong debate performances and repeated trips to the state.Mr. Sanders, who fought Mrs. Clinton to a draw in Iowa four years ago, has struggled to retain support in the party's most liberal pockets. Some of his anti-establishment backers have gravitated to candidates even more outside the mainstream, like the entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Ms. Gabbard.Zach Simonson, the Democratic chairman in Wapello County, backed Mr. Sanders in 2016 and said he was now torn between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren.""I was all in for Bernie in 2016, but with Warren in the race, some of the weaker parts of his candidacy are magnified,"" Mr. Simonson said. ""He's got a very reasonable critique of the national Democratic Party institution, but from campaigning so much on the outside, I don't know if he'll be ready to take the role of national standard-bearer for all Democrats after the convention.""PhotographJoseph R. Biden Jr. in Fort Dodge, Iowa, this week. He has seen his poll numbers dip in the state.; Bernie Sanders was even with Hillary Clinton in Iowa four years ago, but he is losing liberal voters to Elizabeth Warren this time.

| Jump to first hitThe former New York City mayor submitted paperwork on Friday to enter the 2020 presidential primary in Alabama, the first state with a filing deadline, indicating he would pursue a risky strategy of skipping all four traditional early-state contests.Michael R. Bloomberg disrupted the Democratic presidential field on Friday as he took his first steps into the 2020 race, unnerving supporters of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and prompting Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders to accuse Mr. Bloomberg of seeking to buy the presidency.But Mr. Bloomberg's early moves also signaled he would be approaching the campaign in an unconventional manner: In a dramatic acknowledgment of his own late start in the race, Mr. Bloomberg and his advisers have decided that he would pursue a risky strategy of skipping all four traditional early-state contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, and focus instead on big states that hold primaries soon afterward.Mr. Bloomberg, who flirted with running for president in 2008 and 2016 and early this year, but had never taken a formal step to do so, filed paperwork and qualified for the Alabama primary on Friday afternoon. The Deep South state has the earliest primary filing deadline in the country, effectively forcing Mr. Bloomberg to put his name into contention this week if he did not want to get shut out of the ballot.While Mr. Bloomberg has not made a final decision to run, his allies say he intends to enter the campaign. His consideration of a 2020 bid reflects the fluidity of the race and the angst among many leading Democrats about whether Mr. Biden is strong enough to win the nomination as a centrist standard-bearer. Mr. Bloomberg is also acting on his own longstanding ambition to be president: At 77, he is unlikely to have another chance to run if he does not attempt a campaign now.Mr. Bloomberg's moves have already rippled through an unsettled Democratic field. While polls show that most Democratic voters are content with their current array of candidates, there are significant pockets of unease, most of all among politically moderate donors and leaders of the party establishment who are concerned about Mr. Biden's prospects in the primary and fear that Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders are too liberal for the general election.But Mr. Bloomberg will have to overcome considerable doubts across the Democratic Party about his own ability to win the nomination, and prove that he is more than a niche candidate for moderate elites.On Friday, Mr. Bloomberg's camp began to lay out in public a theory of how he might win the nomination: Advisers said he intended to stake his candidacy on big, delegate-rich primary states like California and Texas, where Mr. Bloomberg's immense personal fortune could be put to extensive use.Howard Wolfson, an adviser to Mr. Bloomberg, said in a statement that Mr. Bloomberg would not contest the early states where other candidates have been competing for months, and would mount his candidacy in a different array of states from the outset.""If we run, we are confident we can win in states voting on Super Tuesday and beyond, where we will start on an even footing,"" Mr. Wolfson said. ""But the late timing of our entry means that many candidates already have a big head start in the four early states, where they've spent months and months campaigning and spending money. We have enormous respect for the Democratic primary process and many friends in those states, but our plan is to run a broad-based, national campaign.""Should Mr. Bloomberg proceed with such a campaign, he would be attempting to take a high-risk route to the Democratic nomination that has never succeeded in modern politics -- one that shuns the town hall meetings and door-to-door campaigning that characterize states like Iowa and New Hampshire, and relies instead on a sustained and costly campaign of paid advertising and canvassing on a grand scale.That approach would amount to a high-risk bet that no other candidate emerges from that early-state circuit with the kind of momentum that could overwhelm whatever operation Mr. Bloomberg has built in the Super Tuesday states that vote in early March. It is sure to alienate Democratic Party leaders and stalwarts in the early states, several of which are key battlegrounds in the general election, and intensify complaints from Mr. Bloomberg's opponents about his reliance on personal wealth.The plan to skip campaigning in early voting states drew a sharply negative reaction Friday night from the chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, Ray Buckley.""We are disappointed and frankly very surprised that any candidate would launch a campaign for the White House where their path doesn't run through New Hampshire or any of the other early states,"" Mr. Buckley said.Troy Price, the chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, criticized Mr. Bloomberg for spurning the circuit of early states that he said ""makes candidates and their campaigns better prepared for a general election fight."" Iowa voters, he said, ""kick the tires and ask the hard questions.""Mr. Bloomberg's advisers are preparing to meet several other upcoming filing deadlines, including in Arkansas. It was not clear on Friday night if Mr. Bloomberg still planned to file paperwork by next Friday to qualify for the New Hampshire primary, as he originally intended.Many of the details of Mr. Bloomberg's plans appeared to be coming together at the last minute. Even some of his longtime allies said they had been blindsided by Mr. Bloomberg's sudden move to enter the race, and his advisers were reaching out to assemble staff for a presidential campaign even as Mr. Bloomberg was entering his final deliberations.Michael Nutter, the former mayor of Philadelphia who has long been close to Mr. Bloomberg, said word of Mr. Bloomberg's intentions had taken him by surprise on Thursday night. He said he had spoken to Mr. Bloomberg's camp and come away convinced that Mr. Bloomberg was ""serious about running.""Mr. Nutter, who has been supporting Mr. Biden said he had not yet thought through the implications of Mr. Bloomberg's entry for his own involvement in the race.""I think all the other candidates will take him seriously,"" Mr. Nutter said.Mr. Biden, who appeared to have the most to lose from the sudden entry of a prominent centrist with unlimited financial resources, spoke guardedly to reporters in New Hampshire about that possibility on Friday. He called Mr. Bloomberg an ""honorable guy"" and deflected a reporter's question about whether Mr. Bloomberg, who was elected mayor of New York City as a Republican and became a Democrat only last year, could be considered an authentic member of the party.""Michael's a solid guy, and let's see where it goes. I have no, no problem with him getting in the race,"" Mr. Biden said in New Hampshire, adding, ""Last polls I looked at, I'm pretty far ahead.""Advisers to Mr. Biden have argued in private that Mr. Bloomberg should not be overestimated as a threat to the former vice president, because he may struggle to appeal to the African-American voters and working-class whites who make up most of Mr. Biden's political base.Mr. Bloomberg, who is one of the country's richest men, has his own vulnerabilities, such as his support for stop-and-frisk policing and charter schools, and his opposition to liberal economic policies that involve taxing large private fortunes and breaking up banks and other big corporations.President Trump, for his part, did not sound concerned about Mr. Bloomberg on Friday morning. Mr. Trump noted that Mr. Bloomberg would spend a lot of money on a campaign and predicted he would damage Mr. Biden in the process. Speaking in the terms of derision he usually applies to political rivals, Mr. Trump said without elaborating that Mr. Bloomberg had ""personal problems"" and applied a derisive nickname.""There's nobody I'd rather run against than little Michael,"" Mr. Trump said.Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have already begun to take on Mr. Bloomberg more assertively, both emailing their supporters to warn that a prominent billionaire was seeking to -- as they put it -- buy the presidency. ""The billionaire class is scared and they should be scared,"" Mr. Sanders tweeted on Thursday evening, without mentioning Mr. Bloomberg by name.Campaigning in Raleigh, N.C., on Friday, Ms. Warren avoided attacking Mr. Bloomberg directly but told reporters that a candidacy funded from personal wealth would not produce ""a government that works for the people.""""I don't think that big money ought to be able to buy our elections, and that's true whether we're talking about billionaires or corporate executives that fund PACs or big lobbyists,"" Ms. Warren said.Mr. Bloomberg initially decided last winter that he would not challenge Mr. Trump in 2020, in large part because he concluded he could not win the Democratic nomination with Mr. Biden in the race, as a formidable standard-bearer for the party's moderate wing. But Mr. Biden's struggles in recent months have given Mr. Bloomberg new optimism that there is space for him in the campaign.There is considerable skepticism among the leading Democratic candidates about Mr. Bloomberg's path forward in a 2020 primary. A centrist business mogul in his eighth decade, he would be seeking to lead a party focused on questions of economic inequality, cultural diversity and generational change. (The 2020 field already has several candidates in their 70s: Mr. Sanders is 78, Mr. Biden is 76, Mr. Trump is 73 and Ms. Warren is 70.)But unlike the rest, Mr. Bloomberg has never run a political campaign outside New York City, and he has neither a sweeping progressive platform, like Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, nor a famous friendship with the first black president, like Mr. Biden, to excite the Democratic base.A political nomad with respect to party affiliation, Mr. Bloomberg was elected mayor three times on the Republican ticket before he registered as a Democrat during the midterm elections and spent more than $100 million to help the party take control of the House of Representatives.Former Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, a moderate who has endorsed Mr. Biden, said he believed Mr. Bloomberg had the potential to cut into Mr. Biden's electoral coalition.""I very much would like to see Joe Biden be president, but if Mike Bloomberg was the nominee of the Democratic Party, would I be disappointed?"" Mr. Kerrey said. ""Not in the slightest.""Other supporters of Mr. Biden were more dismissive.""There's not a snowball's chance in hell of him getting the nomination,"" said John Morgan, a Florida trial lawyer who is raising money for Mr. Biden. ""He's a Republican billionaire.""Alexander Burns reported from New York and Katie Glueck from Concord, N.H. Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting from Raleigh, N.C.PhotographSince Michael R. Bloomberg left office as New York City's mayor, polls have shown a wide-scale distrust of billionaires, and Democrats have echoed the sentiment.

| Jump to first hitAs he campaigns, Mr. Biden offers free-flowing analysis about the race he's running in. Among his takes: He should be described as the front-runner, and he's best positioned to beat President Trump.DECORAH, Iowa -- Joseph R. Biden Jr. insists he is the front-runner in the Democratic primary race. He cites polling in battleground states. He suggests that his coattails would help down-ballot candidates win around the country. And he worries aloud about how his answer to a given question might play in the news media (""No matter how I answer that, I'm going to get clobbered,"" he observed recently aboard his campaign bus).As he runs for president, Mr. Biden, the former vice president, has also taken on another role: self-appointed political pundit for his very own primary race, holding forth on the nuances and mechanics of the contest at every turn in the manner of a commentator on cable news.Mr. Biden has always proclaimed his ability to take on President Trump, but as the Iowa caucuses near, his punditry is reaching a fever pitch in interviews, at fund-raisers and on the campaign trail. He has taken to narrating the race with an unusual level of detail, assessing not only his standing in the primary race but also how he would fare in the general election in specific states around the country.Not surprisingly, he has a rosy view of a certain former vice president's chances.""I'm not counting on the polls, but the fact is that I'm ahead in every one of the tossup states by a substantial margin in most places,"" Mr. Biden told reporters in Atlanta last month.Campaigning in Waverly, Iowa, this month, he told the crowd, ""One of the things we have to look at is who is most likely to go out there and help, if they're the nominee, elect Democrats in states that we need to win.""""Right now, I'm the guy who is able to win,"" Mr. Biden added. ""I beat Trump in every one of those states, from Montana to Ohio to Pennsylvania to North Dakota -- I mean, excuse me, North Carolina -- to Florida, to Texas, etc.""Hypothetical general-election matchups are, at this early stage of a volatile race, hardly predictive, and Montana, for one thing, is not generally viewed as a battleground state. And for all of Mr. Biden's touting of surveys, his own polling picture in the Democratic primary is decidedly mixed: While he maintains a lead in national polls and in available surveys in Nevada and South Carolina, he has struggled this fall in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first states to vote in the primary race. A weak showing in those two states could harm Mr. Biden's efforts to cast himself as the safest choice in a general election.But for now, despite a host of missteps and controversies this year, a major factor in Mr. Biden's national resilience in the race is the perception, among some voters, that he is best equipped to defeat Mr. Trump. With the Iowa caucuses fast approaching, Mr. Biden and his backers are presenting a sustained and detailed pitch about his ability to land swing voters and help Democrats up and down the ballot, a message that has been on vivid display recently during trips to Iowa and on the fund-raising circuit.""He's got experience and empathy, but a fair amount of his appeal is also the assumption that he could beat Trump, and he doesn't want to lose that edge and so he may be leaning into that,"" said David Axelrod, President Barack Obama's former chief strategist. ""It's pretty unusual. Generally speaking, you leave the handicapping to your strategists and your spokespeople and your supporters, and you talk about vision and direction. But there isn't anything usual about anything this election year.""Mr. Biden is hardly the only candidate to talk about his political strengths, in a campaign in which Democrats are fixated on the question of how best to defeat Mr. Trump. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota invokes her electoral success in competitive political territory. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., plays up his roots in the industrial Midwest. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont embarked upon a ""Bernie Beats Trump"" tour of Iowa in September. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who promises sweeping change, warns that a Democratic nominee lacking far-reaching ambitions would lose to Mr. Trump.But the case for Mr. Biden, as expressed by the candidate and his surrogates at recent campaign events, can be especially blunt.""Here are three reasons why Joe Biden is the only person for this election,"" Mr. Biden's wife, Jill Biden, told a crowd in Des Moines last month. ""No. 1 is the polls. All of the polls show that Joe Biden is the strongest match against Trump.""During Mr. Biden's ""No Malarkey"" bus tour in Iowa in the days after Thanksgiving, Tom Vilsack, the former agriculture secretary and Iowa governor, also invoked general-election polls against Mr. Trump. ""If you take a look at the polls today, and if you take a look at the polls throughout this entire campaign, the one person who's consistently ahead by a large margin is Joe Biden,"" Mr. Vilsack said.At another event, Mr. Vilsack's wife, Christie Vilsack, offered the same pitch, citing ""the polls in states that will really matter in this election, like Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Michigan, Wisconsin, just to name a few.""Mr. Biden's punditry goes far beyond his ability to compete in battleground states.He has assessed his standing in the primary field (""I am the clear front-runner in the party,"" he told reporters in Atlanta last month). He has cited how he fares against his fellow Democrats (""I lead all the national polls nationwide by double digits, against everybody, consistently,"" he told Telemundo, though his lead was in the single digits in many recent surveys).He has brought up his favorability rating in Iowa (""It's in the 70s,"" he told NPR, though the latest Des Moines Register/CNN poll found it to be 64 percent among likely Democratic caucusgoers). And he has boasted of his support among specific demographic groups, such as black voters (""I have more people in the African-American community supporting me than anybody else,"" he said at an education forum in Pittsburgh on Saturday).He has even spoken philosophically about the importance of the Republican Party's continued existence. Speaking to a group of reporters on his campaign bus in Decorah this month, he fretted about what would happen if ""we win big and the Republicans get clobbered.""""I'm really worried that no party should have too much power,"" he explained. ""You need a countervailing force.""Beyond his own electoral prospects, Mr. Biden argues that his mere presence atop the ticket would help Democratic candidates up and down the ballot, loudly treading into territory that is often discussed quietly among party strategists.""I may not be able to win Georgia, I think I can, but I may not be able to win it. But I can help elect a United States senator from Georgia,"" Mr. Biden said at a fund-raiser in Las Vegas last week. ""Folks, it's important not only, 'Can the person we nominate win?' Can they be helpful to increasing the size and scope of the Democratic Party locally as well as statewide? And I hope and I think if the numbers are true, I think I can do that.""While Mr. Biden and his allies emphasize polls that are good for his campaign, they do not appear eager to draw attention to other surveys that are less positive.Last month, hours after Dr. Biden cited general-election polls as she made the case for her husband, Mr. Biden faced a question about Mr. Buttigieg's apparent strength in Iowa. ""We talk about the polls,"" Mr. Biden told reporters. ""At this point I don't think they mean a great deal.""And despite his tendency to talk about polling, at times Mr. Biden appears to be relying on something less scientific: his gut feeling.""Forget the poll numbers,"" Mr. Biden said on his campaign bus in Decorah, insisting that every one of the reporters sitting before him knew that he had the best shot at helping a Democrat win in North Carolina.""I don't have to go out and look at a poll,"" he said. ""Just go into those states. You can feel it. You can taste it.""Thomas Kaplan reported from Decorah, and Katie Glueck from New York.PhotographJoseph R. Biden Jr. this month in Decorah, Iowa. He argues that as the Democratic presidential nominee, he would help other Democratic candidates on the ballot.

| Jump to first hitThe Vermont senator vowed to slow his grueling campaign pace. He also acknowledged that voters would take his health into account when deciding whether to support him.BURLINGTON, Vt. -- Senator Bernie Sanders, in a striking concession for a leading presidential candidate, said on Tuesday that he planned to slow down his pace on the campaign trail after suffering a heart attack a week ago, and acknowledged that voters would likely consider his health when deciding whether to support him.""I think we're going to change the nature of the campaign a bit,"" Mr. Sanders told reporters after a visit with a local cardiologist. ""Make sure that I have the strength to do what I have to do.""Mr. Sanders's remarks stood in sharp contrast with comments in recent days from his campaign advisers, who have insisted that the Vermont senator was neither changing course nor easing his trademark intensity as a result of the heart attack.Given Mr. Sanders's influential role in the Democratic race, not only as a top candidate but also as a driving force in policy debates, his decision to pull back campaigning injects new uncertainty into the contest -- both for the future of Mr. Sanders's candidacy and the possible ramifications for other contenders.In recent weeks, the race has become more of a two-person contest between Senator Elizabeth Warren, a fellow liberal who shares many of the same goals as Mr. Sanders, and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., whose policy positions are generally more moderate. Ms. Warren has risen steadily in many polls while both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have lost some ground, particularly in surveys of Iowa voters, who will hold the first nominating contest in February.Pollsters said on Tuesday that it was too soon to determine or measure the impact of Mr. Sanders's health issues on voter preferences in the race, but they noted that his admission about his health would create a new challenge for Mr. Sanders, who, at 78, would be the oldest president ever elected by far.""This will just raise the issue of his age, which to me has always been the Achilles' heel of the Sanders campaign,"" said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which polls public opinion in the key primary state. ""When Sanders ran for president in 2016, he was the not-Hillary Clinton candidate and no one paid attention to how old he is. Now, there will be a lot of attention to how old he is, and how old Joe Biden is.""Mr. Biden is 76, while Ms. Warren is 70. President Trump is 73.Speaking to reporters outside his home in Burlington Tuesday, Mr. Sanders gave no indication that he was planning to drop out of the race and said he would continue to campaign actively. Indeed, Mr. Sanders remains formidable: He reported a third-quarter fund-raising total of $25.3 million, the largest in the Democratic field, and he has helped steer many in the party to embrace ideas like ""Medicare for all"" and tuition-free public colleges.Mr. Sanders has been campaigning almost nonstop when not carrying out his Senate duties in Washington, D.C., a pace that he pointedly noted on Tuesday.""We were doing, you know, in some cases five or six meetings a day, three or four rallies and town meetings and meeting with groups of people,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""I don't think I'm going to do that.""""I think we're going to change the nature of the campaign a bit,"" he added. ""Make sure that I have the strength to do what I have to do.""Asked to clarify what he meant when he said the campaign would change, he replied: ""Probably not doing four rallies a day.""Standing next to his wife, Jane, Mr. Sanders also acknowledged that his heart attack could be a factor for voters considering whether to support him.""Everything that happens everyday weighs on how people feel about you,"" he said. ""And my own view is that -- and I think it's the voters' view -- you look at the totality of who a candidate is. You look at what that candidate stands for, the integrity of that candidate, the history of that candidate.""Mr. Sanders's campaign aides were heartened that the first polls since his hospitalization did not show a significant drop in his support. But the candidate and his wife have not been revealing much to the public, or even some of his own staff, about when he would get back to the campaign trail and how aggressive he would be once he does return.It is now almost certain that he will have a far more difficult path to the nomination. Democrats are overwhelmingly focused on finding a candidate they believe can defeat Mr. Trump, having made clear in surveys that ousting a president they loathe is their top priority. Now, in addition to questions about whether he is too far to the left to win over general election voters, Mr. Sanders will have to face doubts about his physical capabilities.Further, unlike in 2016, progressive voters have an alternative to Mr. Sanders in this race. While some of his bedrock supporters will not abandon him, other left-wing voters will gladly cast a vote for Ms. Warren. That was not the case when Mr. Sanders faced Mrs. Clinton in the last primary.Mr. Sanders returned to Burlington over the weekend, after being hospitalized in Las Vegas for three days last week, to recover from a heart attack. His campaign said he felt chest pains during an event last Tuesday, and he was taken to the hospital, where two stents were inserted into an artery.Since then, his campaign has insisted that Mr. Sanders does not intend to drop out of the race. During a telephone call with staff members on Monday, Mr. Sanders said he felt ""more strongly about the need for a political revolution today than I did when I began this campaign.""Jane Sanders, who remains one of Mr. Sanders's closest advisers, said that idea was ""something that the entire campaign, and especially me, have been saying for months -- not for his health but for the ability to keep up that kind of a pace for everybody else, too.""Campaign officials also downplayed Mr. Sanders's remarks.""As Bernie said, we are going to have an active campaign,"" Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, said in a statement on Tuesday evening. ""Instead of a breakneck series of events that lap the field, we are going to keep a marathoner's pace that still manages to outrun everyone else.""Another adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic, said Mr. Sanders had been thinking about changing the pace of his campaign schedule for some time, and aides discussed this with him when he was in the hospital.Known for keeping a grueling schedule on the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders, who finished second to Mrs. Clinton in the 2016 primary, will often crisscross a state with multiple stops for big rallies and smaller town hall-style events and gatherings.There is no recent precedent for a candidate to suffer such a serious health setback in the midst of a campaign, at least not since President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack in the fall of 1955, a year before his re-election. Mrs. Clinton stayed off the campaign trail for three days in the fall of 2016 after she felt dizzy at a 9/11 commemoration but was only diagnosed with pneumonia.In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley was briefly sidelined as he sought the Democratic nomination because he had an irregular heartbeat. Mr. Bradley, a former professional basketball player who was only 56 at the time, returned to the campaign trail but was dogged by questions about his health and was beaten decisively by Al Gore.Jonathan Martin contributed reporting.Jonathan Martin contributed reporting.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders acknowledged that voters would probably take his health into account.

| Jump to first hitJoe Biden leads with black voters, and Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are making better inroads with younger ones than Kamala Harris and Cory Booker. In interviews, voters rejected the idea that racial representation equated to change.ATLANTA -- Chyna Hester knew what she was supposed to say.The 20-year-old Spelman College student had just attended a ""Black Women's Breakfast"" featuring Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate and the second black woman elected to the United States Senate. And speaker after speaker had explicitly argued that black women should support Ms. Harris and leap at the opportunity to elevate someone with their lived experience.But after the event on Thursday, as Beyoncé's ""Brown Skin Girl"" played in the background, Ms. Hester made a sheepish admission: Ms. Harris was not her preferred choice. There were policy reasons -- Ms. Harris has not rolled out a proposal on student debt cancellation, which is Ms. Hester's top issue. But there was also something else. Even at the historically black all-women's college that Ms. Hester attends, supporting Ms. Harris was a particularly uncool thing to do.""It's hard, you know. On social media, there's a different meme about her every day,"" Ms. Hester said. ""A lot of young people don't support her.""""Why aren't black voters supporting the black presidential candidates?"" is an overly simplistic question. Like all voting blocs, black voters have diverse priorities that crisscross the ideological spectrum, creating fault lines across regions, generations and economic class. But in interviews with more than two dozen black voters in Atlanta and across South Carolina, many articulated a particular disenchantment with the idea that racial representation equated to change, and that they should automatically back a candidate who looked like them.Moderate black voters, particularly older ones whose support has helped former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. maintain his lead atop most primary polls, pointed to the election of President Trump, and said nominating the candidate they saw as most capable of ending his administration was a moral priority above all others.And some black voters on the left -- particularly younger ones -- are disappointed by some aspects of former President Barack Obama's legacy and have embraced the idea that supporting a candidate who is willing to upend unjust systems is more important than choosing one from their own community.Mr. Biden, who held events in Atlanta and South Carolina after last week's debate, has made his support from black voters, and the Southern mayors who govern them, a central talking point in his electoral pitch.Dan Webb, a 58-year-old resident of Greenwood, S.C., who is black, said it plainly: He was supporting Mr. Biden because he thought white people in key Electoral College states were more likely to vote for him -- and he wants Mr. Trump out.""Within South Carolina, within the African-American community, we don't want to take a chance on someone that doesn't have a chance of beating Trump,"" Mr. Webb said. ""I feel that Biden is the candidate that has the best chance.""In the latest national polls, Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the two progressive standard bearers in the Democratic primary, are Mr. Biden's closest rivals in terms of black support -- not Ms. Harris, of California, or Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey.""I want black women in office, I do, and I love Kamala Harris and think she's amazing, but I'm just more policy-focused,"" said Amber Lowe, 29, a pastor and community activist in Atlanta. She was backing Ms. Warren.""You need to focus on things beyond relating to me,"" she said. ""I want to talk about the stuff that affects me. What are you going to do for me?""Aqil Shakur, a 53-year-old Atlanta-area barber, said, ""If I had a Kamala Harris or a Cory Booker that sounded like Bernie Sanders, of course I would choose them, because they're closer to my lived experience.""""But the Kamalas and the Corys aren't discussing the issues he's discussing,"" he added.The sentiment among members of the black electorate has squeezed some candidates from both sides, and is especially meaningful for Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris, two black candidates looking to replicate Mr. Obama's electoral playbook.At the debate on Wednesday, both candidates pitched themselves as best equipped to rebuild the ""Obama coalition,"" a subtle dig at moderate candidates like Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who have impressed white moderates but have amassed almost no support among black ones.In the days that followed, at events in Atlanta and elsewhere, Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris re-upped their pitches. More than citing any particular policy, both candidates said black voters could uniquely trust them based on their identities and personal backgrounds.Regarding race, Mr. Booker said the country must elect a president who ""doesn't have an academic appreciation of these issues, but actually has a passion, an instinctual connection -- is someone that we can trust to bring these issues to the front and center.""Ms. Harris said at the Atlanta breakfast that her upbringing taught her lessons about black communities that other candidates had to learn about in textbooks.""I was raised knowing the injustices in the criminal justice system. I experienced it,"" she said. ""I didn't acquire the language to talk about criminal justice as I started running for president.""Pressed by a moderator, Ms. Harris said she felt that she faced two hurdles among black voters: misinformation about her record and lower name recognition than the race's white front-runners.Over the weekend, she held a organizing push called ""Black Women's Weekend of Action.""""When we talk about black girl magic, we know that it is something special,"" Ms. Harris told a crowd at Benedict College, a historically black institution in Columbia, S.C. ""But that magic is born out of hard work.""Her supporters said black voters sometimes held black candidates to an unfair standard, encouraged by a political media biased against women of color.""I think that there is unfortunately a tendency in our community for us to question the authenticity of people who look like us before we question other people,"" said Theia Smith, 39, an entrepreneur from Atlanta who attended the breakfast.But black voters have a history of supporting black candidates. Stacey Abrams, who ran for governor of Georgia last year, galvanized black urban and rural voters throughout the state, which turned her underdog bid into a fiercely competitive one. During Mr. Obama's barrier-breaking run, black voters and young voters helped transform his candidacy into a phenomenon that was equal parts cultural and political, latching on to his outsider image and inspirational calls for unity.Now, younger black voters have largely flocked to Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren over the race's black candidates, because their left-wing promises to upend systemic racism and radically reform the economy are much more in line with the language of activism that emerged after the Black Lives Matter movement during Mr. Obama's presidency. Older voters have stuck with Mr. Biden, despite Ms. Harris and Mr. Booker being well liked by black influencers and elected officials in the Congressional Black Caucus.Mr. Shakur, the Atlanta area barber, pointed to the Obama administration as his political turning point. While he respects the former president, he said Mr. Obama failed to deliver the disruptive change that he desired. The experience changed his political priorities.""We heard social justice talk, but he protected Wall Street, not Main Street,"" Mr. Shakur said of Mr. Obama. He's supporting Mr. Sanders this time. ""I'm not falling for that again.""His son Ali Shakur, 27, said his guiding principle was simple: He wanted to support the candidate ""most committed to fundamental change.""Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren tried to flex that young support after the debate. Mr. Sanders held a rally at Morehouse College on Thursday, the historically black all-men's college in Atlanta, where speakers introduced him as the heir to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy of racial and economic justice. A group of black students was positioned behind Mr. Sanders as he spoke, and he walked out to ""Pick Up the Phone,"" a rap song by Young Thug and Travis Scott.At Ms. Warren's event that day, an evening speech at Clark Atlanta University, another historically black school, that celebrated the political power of black women, supporters voiced similar sentiments. They said her message of ""big, structural change"" was authentic, and they praised her for infusing her policies with corrective measures for racial inequities.Several students said they had no qualms about supporting a white candidate in a primary field that included Mr. Booker, Ms. Harris, and former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, the first black governor in the state's history and one of the newest entrants to the primary field.""Of course black people want to be pro-black, but I feel like their records are anti-black,"" said Jesiah Osbourne, a 19-year-old political science student at Morehouse College.Angela Peoples, an activist and leader of ""Black Womxn For,"" a collective of activists and influencers who have recently endorsed Ms. Warren, led the crowd at Ms. Warren's event in a chant of ""Flip The Table!""""Black voters are being asked, again, to roll along so we can get along,"" Ms. Peoples said, ""but those days are over.""The enthusiastic rallies for Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders were a warning shot to Mr. Biden, and a sign that if the progressives do not secure enough black support to win the nomination, it will not be for lack of effort or careful planning.At the same time, the candidacies of Mr. Patrick and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York could complicate matters, if either can gain enough traction among black voters in search of a moderate to support.In an interview on debate day, Mr. Patrick said his just-announced candidacy was seeing support on the ground from black voters, and that he thought Mr. Biden's lead among them was ""softer than it seems.""""What I'm sensing is not some openness to someone new. What I'm seeing is an openness to me,"" Mr. Patrick said, invoking his background as a black man who grew up on the South Side of Chicago.He had just landed in Atlanta, and was on his way to an event at Morehouse. Three hours later it was canceled: Only two people had shown up.PhotographA rally at Morehouse College for Bernie Sanders, a top candidate among young black progressives.

| Jump to first hitA demographically disparate group values both moderation and great change.Today's America is so deeply polarized that it can be hard to imagine there are people who are really not sure whether they want to vote for President Trump or his Democratic rival.But these ""mythic,"" ""quasi-talismanic,"" ""unicorn"" swing voters are very real, and there are enough of them to decide the next presidential election.They are similar in holding ideologically inconsistent views, but they otherwise span all walks of life, based on an analysis of 569 respondents to recent New York Times Upshot/Siena College surveys in the six closest states carried by the president in the 2016 presidential election.These voters represent 15 percent of the electorate in the battleground states, and they say there's a chance they'll vote for either Mr. Trump or the Democrat.They don't neatly fit archetypes of swing voters like so-called suburban soccer moms. In fact, men are likelier to be undecided than women. And they are not necessarily the white voters without a college degree, particularly in the Midwest, who decided the last election.The poll adds a new mix of characters to the quadrennial cast of swing voters, like a somewhat conservative, college-educated suburban man who does not approve of the president's performance, but strongly opposes a single-payer health system. Or a young man, perhaps even black or Latino, who is not conservative on policy but resents his generation's stringent cultural norms and appreciates the president's defiant critique of political correctness.For now, these persuadable voters in battleground states have a favorable view of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, but not of Elizabeth Warren, our polling shows.Persuadable voters are so powerful because their votes effectively count twice: A voter who flips from one party to the other not only adds a vote to one side, but also subtracts one from the other side's tally. A wide array of evidence confirms their decisive role in recent elections.In the last presidential election, millions of voters flipped from Barack Obama to Donald Trump or from Mitt Romney to Hillary Clinton. In the Midwestern battlegrounds, the flood of white, working-class defections to Mr. Trump overwhelmed the smaller stream of white, college-educated voters who defected from the Republicans.There are places like Howard County, Iowa, population 9,000, where Mr. Trump improved over Mr. Romney by nearly 1,000 votes, while Republican turnout increased by only 22 votes and turnout among unaffiliated voters increased by 50 votes.One might assume that places like Howard County will again be at the center of the contest. But there is no outsize mass of white working-class or rural voters who voted for Mr. Trump among the undecided in the Times/Siena polls.Instead, the Times/Siena polling suggests that the electorate remains deeply divided along the lines of the 2016 election, with many groups contributing a sliver of undecided voters to the broader pool.The size of that persuadable pool depends on how they are defined. Although there is reason to think some voters have more of a partisan lean than they realize, let's call the 15 percent who are still thinking of voting for Mr. Trump or a Democrat the potentially persuadable.As a group they are 57 percent male and 72 percent white, and 35 percent have college degrees. Most, 69 percent, say they usually vote for a mix of both Democratic and Republican candidates. Among those who voted in 2016, 48 percent say they voted for Mr. Trump, 33 percent for Hillary Clinton, and 19 percent for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein or no one. Those who voted in the midterm election voted for the Republican congressional candidate by one point.These potentially persuadable voters are divided on major issues like single-payer health care, immigration and taxes. But they are fairly clear about what they would like from a Democrat. They prefer, by 82 percent to 11 percent, one who promises to find common ground over one who promises to fight for a progressive agenda; and they prefer a moderate over a liberal, 75 percent to 19 percent.Over all, 40 percent describe themselves as conservative, compared with 16 percent who say they're liberal. Forty percent are moderate.Mr. Trump leads Ms. Warren, 49 percent to 27 percent, among this broadly defined group of persuadable voters, slightly improving on his margin over Mrs. Clinton. He holds a narrow 43-37 edge over Mr. Biden, a slight improvement for the president over the Republican performance in the midterm election but far from matching his tallies in 2016.What explains the group's Republican tilt? Some fairly likely Republican voters could be remaining open-minded to an unspecified Democratic nominee, but quickly returning to the president's side against a known challenger.Democrats might prefer to focus on a more stringent way to define persuadable voters. Many of those who said they could go either way selected Mr. Trump against all of his Democratic rivals, or selected all three Democrats against Mr. Trump. They might be less persuadable than they let on. Excluding those voters leaves 9 percent of the electorate that showed no consistent partisanship -- they can be called the truly persuadable.These truly persuadable voters supported Democratic congressional candidates in 2018 by eight points and have less developed views on the presidential race. They support Mr. Biden over the president, 38 percent to 27 percent, but prefer the president to Ms. Warren, 37 to 20. Mr. Sanders is in between, with the president leading him, 34 percent to 32 percent. This group voted for Mr. Trump by a smaller margin in 2016, 37 percent to 30 percent, with the rest casting ballots for minor candidates.Looking at the full pool of potential persuadables, it can be hard to glean any clear insights. But individual demographic groups present a clearer picture of voters pulled in different directions by their ideology, identity, self-interest or attitudes about the president.The white college-educated persuadable voters, in either the broad or narrow definition, have something in common: They may not love the president, but they are not sold on progressives.They oppose single-payer health care, 60 percent to 37 percent, and oppose free college, 55 to 41.They disapprove of the president, but only 32 percent disapprove of both his performance and his policies.Steven Basart, 28, is getting his Ph.D in computer science and describes himself as a Democrat. Yet he would consider voting for Mr. Trump, depending on the Democratic nominee.If it were Ms. Warren, he'd vote Republican, he said: ""I think she's going too far to the left, which would take our country in a bad direction.""Mr. Basart is not a fan of Mr. Trump's personality, but he says it's overshadowing some of his accomplishments.""There are plenty of things not to like about Trump, because he says things that are not nice and potentially racist,"" said Mr. Basart, who is Latino. ""I care somewhat about those things, but I mostly just care about policies, because at the end of the day, that's what affects people.""The relatively small number of persuadable women runs against the assumptions of most electoral analysts, who have long assumed that women are likelier to be up for grabs than men. Now, men are likelier to be undecided than women across all major age, race and educational groups. Like the white working-class voters who remain solid for the president, it seems many women, particularly nonwhite and college-educated women, remain anchored to the swing they already made in 2016.Persuadable men and women generally hold similar views on the issues, including on the president. But they are deeply split over an assault weapons ban, with persuadable women supporting an assault weapons ban by a 26-point margin and persuadable men opposed by 18 points -- including 42 percent of undecided men who say they are strongly opposed.The undecided white working-class voters often seem as if they would be quite receptive to Democrats based on their views on the issues. They support single-payer health care, for instance.But they approve of the president's performance by a comfortable 63-32 margin, and they are as about as conservative as Republicans on the cultural issues that divide today's politics. By a margin of 84 percent to 9 percent, they say political correctness has gone too far. They say academics and journalists look down on people like them, and agree that discrimination against whites has become as big a problem as discrimination against minorities.The persuadable nonwhite voters seem to be an unusual group. They are likeliest to be male -- 64 percent are men -- and 39 percent are younger than 35. They back single-payer by the widest margin, 54 percent to 40 percent. Those who voted say they voted for Mrs. Clinton in 2016 and for Democrats in the 2018 midterms.By a wide margin of 52-32, they prefer a Democratic nominee who would bring fundamental, systematic change to American society over one who would return politics back to normal in Washington.Yet Mr. Trump's approval rating is positive among these nonwhite persuadable voters, with 50 percent saying they approve and 44 percent saying they disapprove. A majority opposes an assault weapons ban. They want a more moderate Democrat, 69-26, over a liberal, even as they demand fundamental change, and 35 percent self-identify as conservative.Young nonwhite men have not traditionally been considered a key swing demographic. As a group, they overwhelmingly back Democrats. They are the sort of voters whom Democrats would ordinarily think of as a turnout target.A disproportionate number of persuadable voters tend to be low-turnout voters as well: 28 percent didn't vote in both 2016 and 2018, compared with 17 percent of those who say there's no chance they'll vote for the other side.There's a common view in politics that campaigns can make a choice between turnout, in which candidates play to their base and try to mobilize new voters, and persuasion, in which they reach out to swing voters.It turns out that many of the low-turnout voters are also the persuadable ones. They don't have the clear, ideologically consistent views that make them a natural fit for either party, and so they are less likely to vote as well.Claire Cain Miller contributed reporting.Word count: 1671Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hitMr. Buttigieg began his campaign in obscurity, staking out progressive positions. As his standing rises, he has moved toward the center, hoping to draw support away from Joe Biden.PHILADELPHIA -- In February, Pete Buttigieg, then a virtually unknown presidential candidate, praised the Green New Deal as ""the right beginning."" In June he called for decriminalizing illegal border crossings. A month later he dismissed criticisms of raising middle class taxes to pay for expanded health care, calling it ""a distinction without a difference.""By October, however, Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., had moved toward the center on all three issues. He has a climate-focused TV ad in which he says, ""I believe that we need to have a plan that works for all of us."" The border crossings issue, he told CNN last week, is ""the kind of stuff that gets us trapped."" And he's a month into an attack on Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for not explaining how she'd pay for an overhaul of health care.For most of his political career, Mr. Buttigieg presented himself as more of a centrist technocrat than a liberal ideologue. But striving for attention in a crowded field, he spent the early part of the 2020 Democratic primary touting an array of aspirational progressive ideas, delivering speeches that could have been ripped from an Aaron Sorkin script.Now a serious candidate with a policy staff stocked with Washington insiders and a war chest boasting millions from big donors, Mr. Buttigieg has gradually reinvented himself as more of a moderate. While he hasn't pivoted 180 degrees on policy proposals, he is modulating his positions and drawing explicit and implicit contrasts with his progressive rivals.With Ms. Warren and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. holding the top positions in the race, Mr. Buttigieg is aiming to peel away support from Mr. Biden by offering himself as the viable moderate alternative to Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.It's a risky maneuver in a moment of rising political populism and leaves Mr. Buttigieg vulnerable to charges of shape-shifting for political advantage. But it comes as Mr. Biden, the centrist standard-bearer since joining the race in April, has been weakened by shaky debate performances and constant attacks from President Trump over his son's dealings in Ukraine. Mr. Biden also turned in a lackluster fund-raising quarter that left him with less than half the cash on hand of Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren and less than one-third the total of Mr. Sanders.""His only pathway to nomination, if he can't break through with communities of color, is to sound moderate while organizing on the ground as a progressive,"" said Michael Ceraso, who until Aug. 1 served as Mr. Buttigieg's New Hampshire state director. ""His hope is candidates who are reformist, like Warren and Bernie, split the progressive vote, and he picks up a middle lane, which is predominately white and male.""Mr. Buttigieg said he's unconcerned with where he fits on his party's broader political spectrum. He said he would be ""the most progressive president on health care in modern times"" but declined to define his proposals as the most progressive in the 2020 field.""I can't keep getting twisted up in different definitions on what's more progressive,"" he said during an interview Sunday.Mr. Buttigieg said his beef with Ms. Warren is not about the ""Medicare for all"" plan she backs.""My big concern with Senator Warren is that she has not explained how to pay for this,"" he said in the interview. ""I've expressed my irritation that it's not being talked about plainly, that tax goes up, premium goes down, you come out ahead. Fine. Even then, there's a multitrillion dollar hole. My biggest problem is not with the terminology, it's with the hole.""Mr. Buttigieg calls his current health care proposal ""Medicare for all who want it."" It would allow anyone who prefers Medicare to buy into it, without eliminating private health insurance. With Mr. Buttigieg and other rivals criticizing her for being evasive, Ms. Warren said on Sunday she would soon release a proposal for paying for Medicare for all.There is a bifurcation within Mr. Buttigieg's campaign. Much of his staff, which was built over the summer before his direct contrasts with Ms. Warren began, is made up of young and energetic progressive organizers, while his supporters and senior aides tend to come from the party's centrist establishment.At Mr. Buttigieg's fund-raising rally in Philadelphia on Sunday, about 1,000 people paid at least $25 to watch a 17-minute speech outside Reading Terminal Market. His supporters said they're drawn to him precisely because of his centrist nature.""Biden's too old, Bernie's too old and Warren is too weird,"" said Debbie Thornton, 60, a secretarial supervisor from Macungie, Pa. ""Warren's ideas are too far-fetched. Pete's plans are doable, they're not fantasy.""Nicole Behr, a 28-year-old project manager from Phoenixville, Pa., said she backs Mr. Buttigieg because he is ""realistic."" She added: ""He's a great person to unify the country. He's not polarizing.""Before he entered the 2020 race, Mr. Buttigieg's only exposure outside of Indiana came during his two-month campaign in 2017 to be chairman of the Democratic National Committee -- a contest in which he stressed his fund-raising abilities and biography above his political priorities.Mr. Buttigieg, the first gay candidate to mount a major campaign for the presidency, appealed to the party's activist wing early in his campaign by proposing structural reforms like adding justices to the Supreme Court and abolishing the Electoral College -- ambitious ideas that had not previously received significant attention.Multiple financial bundlers told the campaign that the Supreme Court and Electoral College proposals were not popular, according to people familiar with the discussions. Mr. Buttigieg has since quietly dropped them from his stump speech. He made no mention of either in Philadelphia or during his first post-debate campaign stop last Thursday in Iowa.During the three-month period ending Sept. 30, Federal Election Commission records show Mr. Buttigieg's campaign spent three times as much money on polling as any other candidate except Tom Steyer, an indication that the mayor is looking for signs of what resonates with voters and what doesn't. While he has condemned Ms. Warren's commitment to a single-payer health care system that would eliminate private health insurance, the roster of donors who have given at least $1,000 to Mr. Buttigieg's campaign includes senior executives at CVS Health, Astex Pharmaceuticals, Anthem Inc. and Ironwood Pharmaceuticals.Mr. Buttigieg said more than 600,000 people have donated to his campaign and that he's never altered a policy view based on conversations with donors. He said he still backs reforming the Supreme Court and abolishing the Electoral College.""If they're giving to my campaign, it's because they believe in what we're trying to do,"" he said. ""Look, I think the way politics ought to work is you explain what you're for, and then people who believe in it will support you. I've never viewed this as something where you chase support with an idea.""As South Bend's mayor he bragged about ""smart sewers"" but rarely engaged in partisan food fights. When he ran for Indiana state treasurer in 2010, Mr. Buttigieg appealed to local Tea Party groups as a fellow traveler worried about government growing too large.""There's some, especially in my party, who think the Tea Party's a wholly owned subsidiary of the Republican Party,"" he said during an October 2010 candidate forum hosted by Citizens for Common Sense, a South Bend group affiliated with local Tea Party organizations. ""But there are many others who believe that the Tea Party's motivated by real concerns about the direction of our government, and the responses of our government to citizens.""In Iowa, where polls show Mr. Buttigieg is in his strongest position -- in third place behind Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren -- he has been running TV advertisements since Labor Day in which he says ""we need real solutions, not more polarization"" and ""others say it's Medicare for all, or nothing.""His shift to the center has come as political strategists see a potential new opening for a centrist, after Mr. Biden appeared wobbly in debates and recorded about one-third the cash on hand as did Mr. Buttigieg. But he's also seeking to exploit the skepticism many Iowans have expressed about the single-payer proposals put forth by Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, according to Laura Hubka, the Democratic chairwoman in Howard County, Iowa.""It seemed like to me he was more embracing Medicare for all and then as he went around through Iowa and talked to people, he got the idea that a lot of people are not comfortable with Medicare for all, people are scared,"" said Ms. Hubka, the only county Democratic leader in the state to endorse Mr. Buttigieg. ""Some of that is different from when he first came out.""While Mr. Buttigieg's shifts have left him vulnerable to attacks from progressive critics who view him as a donor-driven candidate without core convictions, they also come as he has elevated his standing in the historically crowded race.""One thing with such a crowded field is these campaigns have to go through a transition period from where they think they are going to end up in the field versus where they actually end up in the field,"" said Bryce Smith, the Democratic chairman in Dallas County, Iowa. ""He was more concerned about getting farther to the left than he had to be. In the beginning, he came across as that progressive young Democrat and now he's being more like a pragmatic, new-era politician.""Ann Hinga Klein contributed reporting from Ames, Iowa, and Annie Daniel contributed research from Washington.PhotographMayor Pete Buttigieg at a rally in Philadelphia on Sunday. He has shifted away from emphasizing activist policy ideas like expanding the Supreme Court.

| Jump to first hitSmoke machines! Spotlights! Thundersticks! And a very different presidential race.Hi. Welcome to On Politics , your guide to the day in national politics. I'm Lisa Lerer, your host, bringing you a dispatch from my weekend reporting trip to Iowa .Democrats put on quite a show Friday night in Des Moines at their Liberty & Justice Celebration, a 13-candidate event considered the start of the final, three-month sprint to the Iowa caucuses.There were smoke machines! Spotlights! A runway! And, of course, thundersticks!Was this W.W.E.? No, it was the Iowa Democratic Party's annual dinner.Somehow, amid the shouts of the booming announcer and the migraine-inducing glare of thousands of glow sticks, it became clear to me that the race has entered a new phase.There has been no defining moment. No devastating gaffe. But over the past few weeks, the race in Iowa has begun to take a very different form than it had when the candidates sweated through the state fair just three months ago.For months, this was a contest between two of the biggest boldface names in Democratic politics -- former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Now, the number of leading contenders has essentially doubled, creating a four-way race with Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, yes, but also with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. A New York Times/Siena College poll of likely caucusgoers taken last week showed those four candidates knotted at the top of the field.As I wrote with my colleague Reid Epstein over the weekend, the energy seems to be with the two fresher faces, who used the dinner as a display of organizational force.Mr. Buttigieg, helped by a cheering section of around 1,000 superfans who flew in from across the country to attend the dinner, cast himself as the heir to President Barack Obama's political legacy in his remarks -- a direct shot at one of Mr. Biden's central arguments.Ms. Warren used her speech to debut a new line of attack against Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg and her other centrist rivals. ""Anyone who comes on this stage and tells you to dream small and give up early is not going to lead our party to victory,"" she said.The attack underscored how questions about her ""Medicare for all"" plan have become central to this race. The Friday release of Ms. Warren's long-awaited, $20.5 trillion proposal explaining how she would fund the program prompted a new series of attacks over the weekend about the plan's specifics and whether she is being honest about the price tag.Her campaign plans to release a proposal detailing how she would manage the transition from private health insurance plans to universal government-run health coverage. But the questions are likely to trail her for the foreseeable future.Also worth noting from this weekend: The supersized field has finally begun shrinking to merely pleasantly plump. Former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas dropped out on Friday night, and rumors abound of other exits that could be coming soon.Of course, not everything has changed. As has been the case since the start of this crowded contest, most of the field has found it all but impossible to break out of the single digits in polling.At the dinner, Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota delivered strong performances -- to a half-empty room. (Both had the unlucky draw of speaking toward the end of the five-hour program.)And they had it far better than some of the candidates who followed. Former Representative John Delaney of Maryland was introduced with photos of Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana on the screens. And Mr. Bullock delivered the final address of the event -- after being announced as Mr. Booker.Warren rattles Wall StreetWant more about Ms. Warren? Check out this story I wrote for the paper today with the ace business reporter Kate Kelly.We dive into the fury that her rise in the polls has ignited on Wall Street, where money mangers, investors and bankers are contemplating voting for President Trump, threatening to leave the country and loudly predicting a double-digit dive in the market if Ms. Warren is elected.Ms. Warren and her campaign see their rage as more beneficial than any monetary contribution. The joke making the rounds among Democrats on Wall Street is that every time a banker complains, Ms. Warren gets another thousand votes in Iowa.Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We'll try to answer it. Have a comment? We're all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com .Tomorrow is Election Day. Here's a key state to watch.As several states go to the polls, we'll have live results on NYTimes.com and in the NYTimes app on Tuesday night. Here's a cheat sheet from our colleague Trip Gabriel :Three states have particularly consequential elections on Tuesday. Kentucky and Mississippi are choosing governors in unexpectedly competitive races. But perhaps the biggest attraction is in Virginia, where control of the state legislature is up for grabs. Two years ago, the majority in the state's House of Delegates turned on a random drawing to settle a tied race.If Democrats reverse the slim majorities that Republicans hold in both chambers -- as polling and a court-ordered new map of key districts suggest is likely -- it will cap off a decade-long evolution of a Southern state, the former seat of the Confederacy, into a progressive bastion.With a sitting Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, new Democratic majorities in the legislature would be expected to advance liberal priorities on gun restrictions, the minimum wage, health care and civil rights protections for women and L.G.B.T. people. Perhaps most important to Democrats, unified control of state government would put the party in charge of mapping new voting districts in 2021.Virginia, which holds elections every year, has been at the forefront of a national revolt against President Trump among suburban voters since 2017.Tuesday night's returns are certain to be interpreted as a report card on Mr. Trump ahead of 2020. But Virginia is not an ideal presidential bellwether. Republicans have not won a statewide election there since 2009.These elections, like local elections everywhere now, are a kind of referendum on the president; but the simple toting up of W's and L's will not be especially meaningful. More telling will be the intensity of both parties' voters. Look for the margins of victory or loss, and the overall turnout, which nonpartisan analysts think will be in the mid-40s....
