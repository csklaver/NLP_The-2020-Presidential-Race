Many of the most endangered Republicans have concluded that fully embracing President Trump is their only credible path to victory in November, rallying to his side in the final days of the Senate impeachment fight and indulging his most controversial actions and statements.
At-risk Republicans "" including those in battlegrounds such as Arizona, Colorado and Georgia "" are calculating that a strong economy and an energized pro-Trump base will be enough to carry the party as it works to retain the White House and its Senate majority in 2020, according to interviews and private discussions with more than a dozen Republican senators, Senate aides and veteran strategists and officials.
More broadly, most Republicans have also largely jettisoned plans to break ranks with Trump to woo independents and suburban women, who turned on the party in 2018 and helped hand the House to the Democrats. This political positioning is driven in part by their view that Democrats are again poised to nominate a uniquely vulnerable presidential standard-bearer weighed down with ideological or establishment baggage.
'There's nothing in the middle of the road other than dead possums and yellow lines,' said Will Ritter, co-founder of Poolhouse, a center-right ad agency. 'Like no other president before, Republican voters want you to wrap yourself around Trump. There is no upside to doing any distancing.'

Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) has concentrated in recent weeks on rallying base Republicans rather than appealing to moderates for her tough reelection fight, pushing for a swift acquittal in Trump's impeachment trial while raising money off a feud with a CNN reporter she called 'a liberal hack.' Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who is running for reelection in a state Hillary Clinton won by five points in 2016, came under attack by his likely Democratic opponent, former governor John Hickenlooper, after deciding against calling for impeachment witnesses and evidence this week.
And Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), facing a tough intraparty primary fight from Rep. Douglas A. Collins (R-Ga.), has gone all-in on supporting Trump in a state that Democrats are targeting for its growing diversity and booming Atlanta suburbs, including an attack this week on fellow Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) for supporting the call for witnesses.
Loeffler, who has been personally friendly with Romney and who has donated to him in the past, accused him in a tweet of trying to 'appease the left' and concluded: 'The circus is over. It's time to move on!'
Trump's uncontested grip over his party came into focus again Friday as two key Republican senators "" Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who is retiring, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who is not up for reelection "" supported the president by blocking Democratic attempts to extend the trial, couching their positions as driven by frustrations with Democrats. It will mark the first time in U.S. history that no witnesses will be called in a Senate impeachment proceeding.
'There is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the United States Constitution's high bar for an impeachable offense,' Alexander said in a statement, arguing that while Trump had taken 'actions that are inappropriate,' they did not merit his removal from office.

It was the most significant political move made by Senate Republicans this week: Their refusal to join Democrats in calling for additional evidence or witnesses in Trump's impeachment trial, ensuring that it could wrap up in the coming days.
At the center of the calculation was Trump himself, and just how much Republicans feel they can distance themselves from a president who, in just over three years, has traveled from troublesome outsider to Republican Party standard-bearer.
Ritter said some vulnerable Republicans running in swing states and House districts may be able to differentiate themselves from Trump and appeal to the center on specific policy issues, but on something hyper-politicized like impeachment, they cannot afford to cross the president.
'On Trump, it's binary,' Ritter said. 'You're either a treacherous Democrat or you're with the president.'
The 2018 midterm elections did provide a flashing alarm for Republicans about the risks of being inextricably bound with Trump. Democrats retook the House majority after toppling Republican incumbents in many suburban districts and in state and local races "" a takeover that laid the groundwork for impeachment.
Former Republican senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania said challenges in suburbs, such as those surrounding Philadelphia, remain troubling for the party. But he said opposing Trump on impeachment is seen by most at-risk Republicans as the 'wrong way to try to win over those voters.'
'You won't get seen as playing to the suburbs,' Santorum said. 'You'll be seen as playing to the angry leftists who hate the president.'
Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who as the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee worked to keep the probe of Russian election interference as bipartisan as possible, said he fully supports Trump and is surprised that anyone might be surprised.
'He's a Republican, he's president and we support his agenda,' Burr said. 'The media, of course, tries to drive a wedge and wonder, but every poll today shows the president actually stronger today than he was four years ago.'
For Trump, Republican unity on impeachment is the fruit of the ultimate pressure campaign in a short political career defined by them. The president has upended so many norms that he has simply become the norm, with everyone else in the party scrambling to adjust.
That doesn't mean Republicans all personally like Trump or cheer his conduct, either on foreign policy or other matters "" in fact, many Republican lawmakers still complain loudly about him behind closed doors, sometimes mocking him as incompetent and undisciplined.

But many also privately acknowledge that Trump dominates the party in a potent and visceral way and say they are operating out of the partisan reality of an intensely divided nation.
Democrats, they add, should stop expecting a Republican establishment to stand up and block Trump, since Trump himself is now the establishment.
'I regularly talk to five or six Republicans who I feel some closeness to,' said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). 'I've heard for months that they know the president lies a lot. . . . They worry about his character. But they aren't willing to come forward and say that publicly. That's one of the tragedies of this era.'
Former Republican Georgia congressman Jack Kingston said he once had reservations about Trump but has since become an ardent admirer and booster. He explained his transformation with a shrug, saying his party and Washington 'needed a shake-up.'
'I accept it,' he said.
The Georgia primary fight brewing between Loeffler and Collins is a classic Trump-era standoff, he added.
'Any GOP candidate is going to want to show he or she is close to Trump,' Kingston said. 'If you think about the Republican Party, he's the center of the orbit. You don't want him to say something bad about you.'
The impulse for Republicans to link themselves tightly to the president spans the country, and includes some lawmakers not even currently up for reelection. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who doesn't face reelection for four years, released a 30-second ad in Iowa that sided with Trump and attacked former vice president Joe Biden and other Democrats.
'I'd like to thank the Democrats for badly botching this impeachment charade and for spending so much time in a coverup for Joe Biden,' says Scott, who introduces himself as a juror in the Senate trial. 'The real story here is the corruption Joe Biden got away with.'
The ad goes on to levy a series of factually problematic charges against Biden and his son Hunter, but its mere existence is sure to delight Trump "" and sparked speculation that Scott is eyeing a 2024 presidential bid, seeking to cast himself as the torchbearer of Trump's brand.
Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general under Trump who is now running to retake the Alabama Senate seat he vacated to join the administration, is also pushing to prove his fealty to the president "" despite the fact that Trump, furious at Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, publicly and privately berated and humiliated his attorney general for the majority of his tenure.
Nonetheless, on Wednesday, Sessions touted his loyalty to Trump in a trio of tweets focused on former national security adviser John Bolton, whose forthcoming book directly ties Trump to the Ukraine decision at the heart of his impeachment trial. Sessions emphasized that he never publicly criticized the president and dismissed Bolton's memoir as 'an act of disloyalty.'

Former senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said he understands if Republicans poke holes in the Democrats' case against Trump and vote for acquittal but cannot accept Republicans insisting that Trump did nothing wrong. Those who do the latter, he said, are willfully taking a position they know is false.
'That's the difference. Vote to acquit? Okay. You can make that argument. But to say this wasn't an egregious abuse of his presidential duty? That's where this party has problems,' Flake said. 'To suggest otherwise signals complete subservience to the president.'

But Scott Reed, senior strategist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, pointed to Trump's 'unprecedented high approval ratings with the GOP rank and file.'
'It's Trump's party now "" there's no way around that,' Reed said. 'You may not agree with the boxes, but he's checking all the boxes.'
Democrats, meanwhile, have had their own challenges holding their ranks together as Trump voters in red states have made clear to Democratic senators that they will pay a price for opposing the president.
Two centrists who won election last year "" Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) "" as well as Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.), who will face voters this year after a long-shot win in a special election in 2017, have been coy about how they will vote on acquittal, giving hope to Trump's allies that the president could win bipartisan support.
Many Republicans also believe that Trump stands a strong chance of reelection against a flawed Democratic opponent, whether a nominee from the left like Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) or Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), or a longtime politician like Biden.
Dick Wadhams, a longtime Republican strategist based in Colorado, said the specific choice between Trump and the eventual Democratic nominee will help Republicans who have tacked to the right to appease the party's base win over moderates, as well.
'It's going to be a choice on the ballot and not a referendum in 2020, and that's what makes this very different than 2018,' Wadhams said. He added that he was a begrudging Trump voter in 2016 but now is fully supportive. He pointed to Trump accomplishments like passing a tax cut and appointing conservative judicial nominees, as well as his concern about where the Democrats would take the country.
'I still have concerns about the way he behaves, his tweets drive me nuts, and a lot of Republicans feel that way, but at the same time "" Medicare-for-all, Green New Deal, killing fracking "" spare me,' he said, rattling off a list of liberal proposals. 'Democrats are driving people who might want to vote for them back to Trump.'

The top-polling Democratic presidential candidates spent their campaign money at a rapid clip in the final three months of 2019, and they each entered 2020 with less than one-fifth of the money they had raised all year, according to financial reports filed Friday night.
The new filings show candidates were in need of a quick infusion of cash as they entered the final stretch leading up to the costly early contests, the first of which begins Monday in Iowa.
The primary campaign is expected to get even more expensive as it nears Super Tuesday on March 3, when 14 states have Democratic presidential nominating contests. And those who make it to Super Tuesday would face a rival with virtually unlimited funds: multibillionaire Mike Bloomberg.
The leading candidates spent heavily in the final quarter of 2019, buying millions of dollars of advertisements, paying for a sprawling staff and traveling from state to state. 
Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, former vice president Joe Biden and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg spent all the money they raised in the final quarter, filings show. 
And each entered January with less cash on hand than the previous quarter. Sanders had $18.2-million; Buttigieg had $14.5-million; Warren had $13.7-million; and Biden had $9-million, according to the new Federal Election Commission filings, which covered Oct. 1 through Dec. 31, 2019. 
The 11 Democrats currently running in the race together spent $517 million in the fourth quarter alone, which includes the spending of two billionaires self-funding their campaigns.
The biggest spender of the quarter "" aside from the two billionaires "" was Sanders. His campaign spent nearly $50 million in the final quarter, pouring $20 million of that money into advertising. 
Sanders's heavy investments coincided with his ascent in the campaign "" marking a dramatic revival for a candidate who struggled to gain traction over the summer and then suffered a heart attack in October that prompted some supporters to wonder if he would even continue his campaign.
Most other Democratic candidates had millions of dollars less than the top-polling candidates, such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota ($5 million), businessman Andrew Yang ($3.7 million) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii ($2.8 million). 
Meanwhile, President Trump continued to raise and spend record amounts of money for his reelection. Trump's campaign, the Republican National Committee and two joint fundraising committees had a massive war chest of $196 million entering 2020, filings show. 
Trump's fundraising haul in the fourth quarter was fueled by backlash to the House impeachment of the president, campaign and party officials said. 
Trump drew $57 million in the final six months of 2019 from donors giving in low amounts online to the campaign, the party and two affiliated fundraising committees, according to data from WinRed, the online fundraising platform for Republican candidates and groups. Of that, nearly $22 million came from 14 battleground and Rust Belt states, data shows, representing nearly 40 percent of donations that came in during the period. In comparison, 27 percent of the money donated to 2020 Democrats via the Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue came from those 14 states, data shows. Democratic presidential candidates raised $180 million on ActBlue in the second half of 2019, and $49 million came from the 14 battleground and Rust Belt states, records show. 
The WinRed records, which cover the period from July 1 through Dec. 31, 2019, provided the first in-depth look at Trump's base of online donors, who have driven massive amounts of money to Trump's campaign since the 2016 election.
In the second half of 2019, the Trump campaign, Republican Party and two joint fundraising committees drew $5.6 million from Florida; $2 million from Pennsylvania; $1.9 million from Arizona; $1.8 million from Georgia; $1.7 million from Michigan and $1.6 million from North Carolina, WinRed data shows.

In an effort to help cash-strapped Democrats in the primaries, independent groups that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money are stepping in with their own ad campaigns in early states. Despite candidates' promise early on in the campaign to reject support from such groups, several presidential candidates are nonetheless being boosted by them. 
For example, the pro-Biden super PAC Unite the Country raised $3.8 million in 2019 since it launched in late October, new filings show. The group's fundraising was boosted by a $1 million donation from a single donor: San Francisco-based billionaire real estate broker George Marcus. 
The super PAC raised another $3.8 million in January for a total of $7.6 million and plans on spending most of that on ads and research to help Biden in Iowa, officials said. 
Bloomberg, who is running an ad-driven campaign with the hope of winning enough delegates on Super Tuesday, spent $200 million in the first six weeks of his campaign "" exceeding the amount of money the rest of his Democratic rivals spent altogether in the fourth quarter. 
His campaign spent about $188-million from mid-November through December, with the vast majority going to ads and advertising firms. 
Trump's huge reelection machine continued to drive money to his family business. In the final quarter of 2019, Trump's reelection committee paid $193,000 to Trump-related properties.
As the president faces mounting legal bills from his impeachment trial, he is relying on money raised through the national party committee. In December, the RNC paid an additional $60,000 in legal fees to the law firm Raskin - Raskin, which is representing Trump in the impeachment proceedings.

As a busy single father of twin 10-year-old boys who hates grocery shopping, brunch is an ideal meal out to start the day. So I'd hit a private booth at one of our favorite spots,
the Hamilton
, for its incredible Southern fried chicken sandwich, and its enormous pancakes for the kids. It's a win-win-win scenario.
A midday adventure at the
National Archives
would be next because my kids really enjoy American history, and I love asking strangers if they've seen 'National Treasure' "" it's a millennial's 'Citizen Kane.' After popping over to the
Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History
's killer new dinosaur exhibit, the boys and I would hit 
Wiseguy Pizza
in Navy Yard for a slice of its buffalo chicken pizza. I'd spend the rest of the afternoon crushing my kids in Monopoly while sipping an Americano at 
Tryst
in Adams Morgan.
I'd have a completely affordable and mostly trustworthy babysitter sweep my kids away for the evening then head to happy hour and dinner with the Constituents crew at
Union Market
to run through our show planned for that night. I'm extremely fortunate to collaborate with such a brilliant group of comedian friends. Rose Vineshank, Chris Lawrence, Kevin McLain, Jon Yeager, Brock Snyder, Reid Clark and I would throw down some
TaKorean
and
Sloppy Mama's BBQ
. And let's throw in a few Atlas Brew Works's Damn Good IPAs.
Next up would be a stop at
District Doughnut
. Since this is a dream day, I'd come across Seth Rogen in line and we'd spend an hour hashing out his next movie plot on the back of a napkin. His films are always great, and his political activism and charitable work have always resonated with me.
After a quick Uber ride, I'm now at
Union Stage
, throwing on my Wolf Blitzer glasses and spray-dying my hair white. Writing and performing comedy is the passion that led me to creating this show, but the connection with the audience is what continues to drive me. Our fans, to me, are a reflection of a city that is looking to disconnect, get offline, and share some laughs over the absurdity of our 24/7, hyper-polarized world. So the stage goes dark, and a few moments later the Constituents and I are taking liberties and serving justice for all.
Then it's the after-party. Catching up with lingering audience members typically leads me to a nearby bar with a group of new friends. We'd still have time to grab a savory late-night meal at

Tiki Taco
before heading to the basement of
the 

Big Hunt
to wrap up the day with a midnight comedy show.

goingoutguide@washpost.com



In D.C. Dream Day, we ask our favorite people in the area to tell us how they would spend a perfect day in the District.
When comedian Tim Kardashian threw together the Unofficial Correspondents' Dinner in April at the Comedy Loft of DC, he imagined the political roast as a one-off event. But with a warm reception came loftier ambitions for Kardashian and his comedic cohorts.
So they decided to reunite as a comedy troupe, called the Constituents. Over the past six months, they've donned wigs and suits to lampoon various political figures in shows around the District, including a satirical Democratic debate and a roast of the Republican Party.
'I didn't really see all of this coming,' says Kardashian, 39, who calls himself the troupe's 'founding father.' 'I just thought it would be a fun comedy show that people would come out to see, and it's really blossomed into its own thing organically.'
Now, the Constituents are diving headfirst into election year hysteria: Their next show, billed as the Battle for 2020, will be hosted on Jan. 9 at Union Stage, with proceeds going to Seth Rogen and Lauren Miller Rogen's Alzheimer's nonprofit, Hilarity for Charity. Just as he did for the Unofficial Correspondents' Dinner, Kardashian will oversee the festivities in character as CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer. Other comics will play President Trump, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Vice President Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, among others, in what Kardashian promises will be a bipartisan skewering.
A performance with the Constituents is on the schedule as Kardashian imagines his perfect day in the D.C. area, which also includes a Smithsonian venture and a wide range of cuisine.

The way Americans pick their leaders, in high-stakes elections where candidates battle to distinguish themselves from one another, can feel nasty, fierce, aggressive and even desperate. In a democratic republic, that's exactly as it should be. But the process is also plagued by myths and errors about how the system really works. With 14 states and one territory voting on Super Tuesday to select the Democratic nominee for president, here are some of the most persistent ones.
Myth No. 1
Politicians choose policies based on principles.
With elective officeholders justifying their positions on the campaign trail as the best and only possible options, it's natural that we see them as deeply committed to those ideas. The Lima News, Rep. Jim Jordan's local paper, describes the Ohio Republican as ""a true believer in conservative ways"" for his battles on behalf of ""less government, lower taxes, the free market system and a strong military."" This is why the greatest betrayal a politician can make is to appear to have sold his or her principles to moneyed interests. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, contrasting herself with other Democrats who take corporate donations, calls herself ""People-Funded,"" without lobbyist cash, in her Twitter bio. 




But politicians rarely take stands that work against their electoral interests. Most of the lawmakers whose votes most closely track the party line hail from districts that vote more heavily for one party than the other, according to the Cook Partisan Voting Index (PVI), which measures a district's partisan performance compared with the national average. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has taken lumps during the presidential primary contest for building a record friendly to gun owners in a predominantly white and moderate state where voters once strongly opposed anti-gun legislation. (Now white moderates in Vermont want action on guns, and Sanders is happy to deliver; he called his previous choices ""bad"" in the last debate.) If Ocasio-Cortez represented New York's 17th District, where the Cook PVI score is +7 for Democrats, rather than New York's 14th, where the party has a score of +29, she would probably have to adjust her approach, too.
Myth No. 2
Gerrymandering isn't driving polarization. 
While gerrymandering is often blamed for many problems, many political scientists diminish its contribution to polarization. University of Denver professor Seth Masket wrote in 2014 that ""districts tend to polarize more between redistrictings than during them,"" meaning that people sort themselves instead of being sorted by boundary-drawers. Political scientists Nolan McCarty, Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal concluded in a study that gerrymandering increased the GOP's share of the House, but ""this increase is not an important source of polarization"" in the electorate.
But while gerrymandering may not be the root cause of polarization, that doesn't mean it doesn't contribute, perhaps significantly. The past two redistricting cycles radically shrank the number of competitive districts, from 164 in the late 1990s to just over 70 today, about 17 percent of the House. One consequence is the rise of the primary as the greatest threat to incumbents. Now that 83 percent of House members represent safe districts, party primaries are dominated by ideologues and activists. The effort to fend them off drives officeholders to the political fringes. Republicans today, for instance, surely remember the object lesson of Rep. Eric Cantor (Va.), a stalwart conservative majority leader who was nevertheless dethroned by a challenger from the right in 2014. Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley was ousted in a similar challenge by Ocasio-Cortez.
Myth No. 3
College-educated, suburban GOP women flipped the House.
After the Republican defeat in the 2018 midterm elections, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham said his party needed to address ""the suburban-woman problem, because it's real."" Political analyst Bill Schneider told the Hill.TV that he noticed ""a lot of affluent, white suburban voters, well-educated, particularly women, fleeing the Trump party.""
Yet party-loyalty voting in 2018 was typical, with 94 percent of all House votes cast by Republicans going to Republican candidates and 95 percent of Democrats voting for Democratic candidates, following the pattern of the past two decades. Senate party loyalty is only a little weaker - averaging 92 percent in 2018 and displaying little variation from the cycles before Trump. 
The real change was who showed up to the polls - more women, young people (who increasingly live in suburbs), Latinos, Asian Americans and African Americans - not loyal voters who flipped. That meant electorates favorable for Republicans in 2014 became electorates favorable for Democrats in 2018. The real ""swing"" is the decision to vote at all, a choice driven largely by the backlash to Trump. 
Myth No. 4
The American electorate is center-right.
After the 2016 election, CNN's John King said that ""America is a center-right country"" and ""is a lot more conservative, especially out in the heartland, than Democrats think."" And it's true that polls show there are many more ideological conservatives in the United States (31 percent, in a survey by the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University, where I am an assistant director) than there are ideological liberals (16 percent), while a solid chunk in the middle (51 percent) call themselves moderate.
But in the same surveys, voters express a clear preference for liberal policies, such as universal background checks for gun purchases (89 percent, in a Washington Post-ABC News poll), same-sex marriage (61 percent, according to Pew), giving legal status to ""dreamers"" (60 percent, Ipsos found) and legalizing marijuana (67 percent, in a Pew survey) - not to mention clear disdain for some key elements of President Trump's agenda, such as building a border wall (60 percent oppose it, Gallup found) or 2017's GOP tax-cut package (46 percent disapprove, according to Gallup). 
The gap is due to a polling phenomenon known as ""symbolic ideology,"" in which people support general principles like ""limited government"" and ""equality."" Asked about specific policies, though, respondents manifest their ""operational ideology,"" in which they are consistently more progressive. The decades-long GOP messaging effort against ""liberalism"" symbolically has worked, but the party's efforts to stamp out liberal policies have not.
Myth No. 5
High turnout helps Democrats; low turnout helps Republicans.
Both parties seem to agree with this premise. In 2012, Pennsylvania state Rep. Mike Turzai said new voter ID requirements would ""win the state of Pennsylvania"" for GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, implying that the rules would keep some people from voting. In 2016, Sanders said: ""Democrats win when the voter turnout is high. We can generate that. Republicans win when the voter turnout is low."" And it's true that higher helps Democrats, because they experience greater drop off in nonpresidential cycles because of lower participation by key elements of their coalition: nonwhite and younger voters. 
But a recent study of nonvoters commissioned by the Knight Foundation found that universal participation would benefit the GOP in many key swing states. In Virginia, 35 percent of nonvoters would vote for Trump and 31 percent would vote for a Democrat. In Arizona, where Democrats are trying to make headway, 34 percent would vote for Trump and only 25 percent would choose a Democrat. In Florida, 36 percent of nonvoters would select Trump and only 31 percent would vote for a Democrat. 
That's because the country is undergoing a long-term political realignment. Once dominated by rural voters, the Democratic Party is now the urban party; once urban, the Republican Party is now the rural party. America's suburbs are ground zero, creating swing districts and swing states in places where the suburbs are competitive. Because turnout rates are nowhere near universal, even with the dramatic increases since Trump's election, high turnout is benefiting Democrats in the suburbs, whereas high turnout in more rural and exurban areas boosts Republicans. Based on 2018's participation rates, turnout in both geographic areas is likely to increase in 2020 over 2016, but the country's population has grown denser, probably creating an advantage for Democrats.

A day after another string of dominant victories that moved him closer to the Democratic presidential nomination, Joe Biden's campaign was working to reboot amid broad concerns within the party that his current operation is ill-equipped to match President Trump's behemoth reelection effort. 
Biden pulled off the most stunningly swift turnaround in modern political history with a relatively small staff, underwhelming fundraising and a campaign occasionally marked by dysfunction and turmoil.
After he finished fifth in New Hampshire just four weeks ago, there were questions about how his campaign could gracefully end. But Biden now has won at least 15 of the last 21 voting states, making him the candidate likeliest to face Trump in a highly polarized, extremely expensive general election. 
Biden's advisers are taking steps to expand virtually all parts of his shoestring campaign operation, from finance, field and communications departments to the senior leadership team, answering the concerns of senior Democrats who are bracing for a new wave of assaults from Trump. 
That effort will occur even as Biden continues to battle for delegates with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who announced Wednesday that he would stay in the race as he issued policy demands to Biden on issues like health care.
""We will be building out every team here,"" Biden senior adviser Anita Dunn said Wednesday, after making clear that the primary mission of the campaign remains acquiring enough delegates to win the nomination. She suggested that would be done at least in part by embracing aides to former candidates, many of whom have endorsed Biden in recent days. ""We are seeing an enormous amount of talent from people on other campaigns. We would hope that we would be able to have some of those people joining this campaign.""
Dunn took on new management and strategic responsibilities shortly before the New Hampshire primary. She is likely to shift out of some of that responsibility in the coming months, leaving open the possibility of changes at the top of the operation, according to a person familiar with the campaign's discussions who was not authorized to speak publicly.
In recent weeks, the campaign has relied on Jen O'Malley Dillon, the campaign manager for former congressman Beto O'Rourke (D-Tex.), who helped Biden's team retool ahead of the Nevada caucuses and has offered strategic advice on a volunteer basis. No announcement has been made about her taking on a formal role.
At the same time that he tries to finish off Sanders and bulk up his campaign, Biden also is planning for a vice presidential selection process later this spring, following the recommendation of the Bipartisan Policy Center that any vetting begin at least two months before a nominating convention. 
Throughout the primary race, even some of Biden's top allies have been confounded by the struggles of his campaign operation and worried about this period, when the nomination is not yet secured but the incumbent president can aim his firepower at the leading opposing candidate. 
Several Democrats involved in the campaign had front-row seats in 2012 when President Barack Obama used a massive spring and summer advertising offensive to define his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, in swing states as a predatory businessman who was not in touch with the concerns of regular Americans.
Unlike Romney, Biden will be assisted by a constellation of outside Democratic groups, including Priorities USA and American Bridge, which announced this week a strategic decision to defend Biden this spring in key swing states, even though he has not yet locked up the nomination.
As it stands now, the campaign's senior leadership remains a kitchen cabinet of new and old advisers, a setup Biden has used throughout a political career that spans more than four decades. His former chief of staff, Steve Ricchetti, functions as campaign chairman; his longtime adviser Tom Donilon is the strategist; the candidate's sister Valerie Biden Owens is a close adviser; and the campaign apparatus is overseen by Dunn, a veteran of the Obama campaigns, and Greg Schultz, the campaign manager.
""He has a very loyal group around him, and that group gives him comfort, and that group is still going to be there,"" said David Axelrod, a former strategist for Obama who has worked closely with Dunn. ""But there has to be room for a more formal and developed campaign structure that does all the very complex blocking and tackling."" 
The new planning has been enabled by a windfall in campaign contributions and endorsements that have effectively put the bulk of the party apparatus at his disposal. The organizers for Unite the Country, the super PAC backing Biden, said they raised $10 million over the past 10 days and have $30 million in additional commitments. 
""The good news is, the entirety of the Democratic Party and the Democratic Party establishment is available to them and willing to help them,"" said one senior adviser to a onetime Biden rival, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. ""The question is, can they retool and bring in a second wave of talent and leadership?""
But the campaign's abilities continue to face criticism. Even as Biden won every county in Michigan this week, local Democrats voiced concern that his light footprint in the state foretold a fall repeat of 2016's disaster for Democrats, when Hillary Clinton counted Michigan as a safe bet for her campaign until it was too late. Biden also has only a scattered presence in three states that will vote next week and that his campaign says will play roles in the general election - Florida, Arizona and Ohio.
Donors who had been sitting on the sidelines or supporting other candidates have complained in recent weeks that they are unable to connect directly with Biden or top campaign officials, saying there are not enough finance directors to field the incoming requests. 
Millions of dollars in donor commitments have flowed to the campaign since Super Tuesday. Endorsements are coming so quickly that campaign officials are learning about some of them on Twitter. 
""This was a campaign that was running in a very lean fashion. It's great because it saved the money they needed. But now it's created kind of a logjam for people like me,"" said Alan Kessler, a longtime Biden donor and Democratic fundraiser. ""I'm not the only one getting these emails and calls. People are a little anxious."" 
Just this week, Rufus Gifford, who ran Obama's 2012 reelection finance operation, emailed hundreds of donors and fundraisers in his network to help the campaign counter Trump's fundraising machine and to help direct donations to the national and state Democratic parties.
""Now it's about building a long-term infrastructure, making sure the money continues to flow,"" Gifford said Wednesday. ""You have the recipe for a real success and a real coalition to pull the voters across the finish line. The campaign has got to scale [up]. You can't do this on a shoestring.""
As part of his march toward the nomination, Biden also is planning to offer Americans a fuller picture of how he might govern, part of his effort to draw a sharp contrast between his hypothetical tenure and Trump's polarizing and unorthodox politics. The aim is to convey the potential for renewed stability, an emphasis on competent governance and a restoration of American leadership around the globe.
""At this moment, there's so much fear in the country,"" he said in remarks Tuesday night that served as a template for his future pitch. ""There's so much fear across the world. We need presidential leadership that's honest, trustworthy, truthful and steady.""
On Thursday, during a speech from his hometown in Wilmington, Del., Biden is planning to address the coronavirus pandemic to provide a counterpoint to a White House that has downplayed the severity of the global crisis. 
Campaign leaders say they are not yet focused on planning for the early days of the administration, should Biden win the White House. But among a broader group of outside allies, conversations that were previously unthinkable have started quietly taking place, including when Biden may form a transition team and how he would craft an agenda to implement in the first 100 days of a presidency.
Biden himself has from time to time begun openly ruminating about a potential Cabinet - last week telling O'Rourke, seemingly off-the-cuff, that he could lead the effort on gun-control policy - and about finding a vice president who could be to him what he was to Obama. 
""For me, I think the most important thing in choosing a vice president is whether or not the person is simpatico with me,"" he told MSNBC on Monday. He stopped himself, to say it was presumptuous to talk about it. And then he continued to talk about it.
""We can disagree on tactic, but not on strategy,"" he said of a potential partnership. ""That's the first test - and there are a number of women, and African Americans as well, who meet that criteria for me.""
He is almost certain to pick a woman to be his running mate, according to allies in close contact with the campaign. During the MSNBC interview, Biden also said it was ""very important"" that his pick will have been tested on the presidential campaign stage, which could narrow his options. 
Those close to several of his former rivals - including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) - said that no conversations have taken place. 
""It wouldn't shock me at all if he welcomes former rivals,"" said former senator Chris Dodd, who remains in close contact with Biden. ""He doesn't hold grudges. Biden's been around too long to understand that doesn't get you too far. His instincts would be to be inclusive.""
The overriding goal for now, however - one that has taken on new urgency amid the coronavirus scare and a tumbling stock market - is casting Biden as a president who could allow the country to exhale and worry less about what the government was doing.
""He's emerging as that stable figure that the country needs,"" said Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), a former presidential candidate who has backed Biden. ""It's not going to be the circuslike atmosphere that is happening right now.""

DES MOINES "" President Trump, on the cusp of acquittal by the Senate and with the highest approval rating of his tenure, marched newly emboldened into the State of the Union address on Tuesday night. The Democratic Party's presidential primary has descended into chaos, with early figures showing that its onetime front-runner, a once-formidable former vice president, is politically wounded. 
The Democratic five-alarm fire has begun. 
Around the country on Tuesday, Democrats found themselves baffled by the circumstances engulfing their party "" even one that is known for, and sometimes takes pride in, its tendency to overreact with worry. 
'This is just one sad week,' said former senator Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.).
'While I am having these very dark, sad feelings about the Senate GOP and a whitewash, here comes this mess in Iowa,' Boxer said, referring to the impeachment trial. 'This is a wake-up call. We're going to be tested.'
Democrats, after three-plus miserable years under Trump, hoped this would be a turning point, with the president facing impeachment for allegedly abusing his power and Democrats beginning in earnest the campaign to oust him. But neither process is going as planned, reviving Democratic jitters that Trump is somehow not subject to the ordinary laws of politics.
And there is little confidence the coming weeks will provide much clarity. Arguably one of the biggest beneficiaries of the current turmoil is former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, a presidential hopeful who could see an opening in the chaos. On Tuesday he announced he was hiring more staff, spending more on television ads and scheduling more campaign events. 
For all the scandals and allegations against him, Trump's approval rating rose Tuesday to 49 percent, his best Gallup poll performance since 2017. Approval of his handling of the economy has also been strong.
Some Democrats say that is a far more ominous warning sign than the confusion in the Iowa caucuses.
'Far too many Democrats are wrapping themselves around an axle about the delay of results and release of data in Iowa,' said Jen Psaki, a Democratic consultant and veteran of three presidential campaigns. 'The existential threat to [a Democrat] being in the White House is Donald Trump is about to be acquitted and his approval rating has gone up. We're missing the point here.'
Democrats were concerned that turnout for the caucuses, which party officials just weeks ago predicted would hit record levels due to voter enthusiasm to take on Trump, apparently fell short of expectations, potentially suggesting a lack of enthusiasm for the candidates.
Turnout was on course to match the numbers for 2016, but was likely to fall far short of the 2008 caucuses, when a historic number of Iowans showed up to show their enthusiasm for then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.). The falloff coincided with relatively low interest in the Democratic presidential debates, which have not attracted same the level of viewership as in prior election cycles.
'For a while I think there was this thought that you have these candidates running different kinds of grass-roots campaigns and doing this organizing, and that's going to bring new people into the caucus,' Psaki said. 'That didn't happen. We don't need to panic or wet our beds here, but we need to take a look at what that means.'
Some party officials said that while the relatively low Iowa turnout may suggest an uncertainty as to who is the best choice to run against Trump, it does not reflect a lack of enthusiasm, and they predicted that many of the voters who stayed home will turn out in November.
Still, the combination of the muddled result, a botched process that forced the Iowa Democratic chairman to apologize late Tuesday, and the low participation levels was demoralizing to many in the party.
'Iowa was a debacle,' said Joe Trippi, a longtime Democratic consultant, adding that the confusion about what actually happened was especially damaging. 
'We don't know a damn thing "" that's what's crazy,' Trippi said. 'This totally transparent thing that everyone in the room knew what happened and saw it happen "" and no one outside the room knows. It's just mind-blowing.'
The party began releasing some of the results late Tuesday afternoon, and with 62 percent reporting, former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) were vying for first place, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) trailing in third. 
Biden was in fourth, a disappointing finish after he made a major push in the state in the past two months, taking a campaign bus all around Iowa, working to earn the biggest endorsements, and spending significantly on television ads. 
Instead, the leaders were two un or tho dox candidates "" the 38-year-old former mayor of a small-to-medium city and a 78-year-old democratic socialist who recently suffered a heart attack. The showing began to fray nerves among Democrats who have had lingering concerns about Biden's sluggish campaign style, small crowds and rhetorical missteps.
'This is not going particularly well so far,' James Carville, a well-known Democratic consultant who has endorsed Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) for president, said on MSNBC.
Taking aim at the Democratic leadership, Carville added, 'This party needs to wake up and make sure that we talk about things that are relevant to people. In 2018 we had good, diverse, strong candidates that had real connections and talked about real things. We don't need to become the British Labour Party.'
That party suffered a major defeat in the last British election under left-leaning leader Jeremy Corbyn. 
'Right now, I've got to tell you,' Carville said, 'I'm not very impressed.'
Biden was the only one of the top four candidates who lost support from the first round of voting Monday night to the second round. 
It was just a few days earlier that Biden, while stopping for ice cream on the campaign trail, mocked Buttigieg for being a small-town mayor. 
'You guys have seen Pete. He's a good guy,' Biden told a group of reporters. But he added, 'You know, I've gotten more than 8,600 votes in my life.'
As the initial results came in on Tuesday, Buttigieg was on course to get more votes than Biden has received in his three runs for president. 
Some of Biden's campaign aides and supporters defended his showing, attributing the loss more to the demographics and dynamics of Iowa than any fundamental problem with his campaign. With upcoming primaries in Nevada, South Carolina and an array of Southern states with more diverse populations, they predicted he would rebound.
'You can't construct a worse scenario for Joe Biden to have to run in [than Iowa] "" he has to fight with both hands tied behind his back,' said Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), a former presidential candidate who endorsed Biden. 'He is strongest with communities of color and older voters, and the caucus doesn't allow for any of that.'
Ryan said that as he called Iowans leading up to the caucuses to advocate for Biden, a number of older voters said that they were struggling to get to the polls, especially since the caucuses can take several hours.
'It was like, how do you expect this guy to win this thing, or do well, when his strength in the electorate is not coming to the polls?' Ryan said. 'If it was a primary, he would have won. Those voters who can walk in and vote and walk out, working-class people. I think he would have won this thing.'
Ryan said that Biden could revive himself, especially in Nevada and South Carolina. 
'People are happy to start moving onto some larger states with a little more diverse electorate,' he said. 'It's not even fair,' he added, referring to Iowa.
More broadly, some Democrats warned against reading too much into the party's struggles over the past week, given the turbulent and fluid condition of the current political landscape. With the focus quickly moving toward next Tuesday's New Hampshire primary and beyond, and with impeachment soon in the rear view mirror, the party's natural strengths will reassert themselves, they said.
'We are much better talking about health care and climate change and other issues than impeachment,' said Barney Frank, a former congressman from Massachusetts. 
Many in the party remain optimistic that a surge of energy from voters frustrated and angry at the Trump presidency is likely to power them to victory in November.
'A lot of times in politics, it's good to get the bad stuff out of the way,' Boxer said, adding that she was choosing to be philosophical about the week's woes for her party. 'Whether that's the weaknesses of candidates or the weaknesses in voting systems "" it's best to get them out of the way.'
Still, Frank said, one thing is clear from the past few days.
'This is the coup de grace for the Iowa caucus,' he said. 'There are so many substantive arguments against Iowa, it being unrepresentative and being a caucus state. But this screw-up greatly increases the leverage. This should be the final push to getting rid of Iowa.'

DES MOINES "" For Luis Gomez, community has always meant soccer. Growing up in Mexico, he would tag along with his father as he played with his friends on Sunday mornings. After moving to Iowa, they kept playing together, drawing in new friends. 
So when Iowa organizers for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) encouraged the presidential hopeful's supporters to find ways to bring people together and prepare for Monday's caucuses, Gomez suggested a soccer tournament.
On a cold Saturday night in January, about 150 players "" mostly Latinos, although there were also Bosnian, Nepalese and Bhutanese players "" gathered at East High School for some 5-on-5 indoor matches. Members of the diverse high school's JV soccer team, which Gomez coaches, were also there. 
Before play began, campaign organizers coached players in Spanish and English on how to participate in the nation's first presidential nominating contest and explained why they should caucus for Sanders. A Salvadoran team won the tournament and, as a prize, will meet Sanders on Sunday. The campaign walked away with contact information for 150 people. 
Although Latinos make up just 6-percent of Iowa's population "" the vast majority of the state's residents are white "" they have more than doubled in number over the past two decades. There are more than 50,000 registered Latino voters in the state, plus-thousands more who are eligible, making them a potential force in caucuses that campaigns expect to draw up to 240,000 voters.

Sanders's operation has done far more than his competitors in seeking the support of those voters, having belatedly realized in his 2016 campaign the growing heft of Iowa's Latino voters "" and their attraction to him. 
It estimates that fewer than 3,000 Latinos participated in the 2016 caucuses overall, and hopes to dramatically increase that number this year. The campaign says it is in regular communication with tens of thousands of Iowa Latinos, and the League of United Latin American Citizens in Iowa "" whose leaders are excited by the heavy investment Sanders is making in the sort of organizing they have done for more than a decade "" has separately set a goal of getting 20,000 Latinos to the caucuses. 
The campaign hopes its Latino effort in Iowa will serve as a template for states with much larger Latino populations that will soon vote, including Nevada, California and Texas. 
The other major campaigns have not ignored the Latino community, but their footprint is far smaller. Former vice president Joe Biden has a Latinx organizer who is based in Storm Lake, a small city in northwest Iowa that's 38-percent Latino. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has a similar organizer who is based in Des Moines, and the senator appeared on 'Qué Pasa Iowa,' a popular Spanish-language political show on Facebook. Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., has Spanish-speaking organizers in cities with large Latino populations, including Des Moines, Storm Lake, Iowa City and Marshalltown "" where one of his volunteers is a musician from Brazil who cannot vote but persuaded his boyfriend, who voted for Donald Trump in 2016, to caucus for Buttigieg on Monday. 

'We either need a woman or a minority or a gay man [elected president] to gain back the respect of the world,' said Hudson Lourenço, 27, who started out liking Warren and Sanders the most. 'It would be historic, and it would be a way to show the world that we're not behind.' 
Julián Castro, a former San Antonio mayor and federal housing secretary, had been reaching out to the Latino community before he ended his campaign. Castro endorsed Warren and has been campaigning for her in Iowa.
Cristal Garcia, 18, worked on Castro's campaign and is now a LULAC organizer. She is torn about her caucus choice, feeling that she should follow Castro and commit to Warren, whom she has met. 
'But then there's Bernie, who I relate to a lot,' Garcia said. 'I'm just kind of stuck between them.'


For months, the Sanders operation has been quietly doing things Latino activists have long begged presidential campaigns to do: Hire a diverse staff instead of a single Latino organizer; have Spanish-speaking staffers or volunteers visit or call the homes of Latinos instead of sending volunteers who can't pronounce their names properly; visit diverse communities and listen to many viewpoints instead of meeting just with community leaders; create advertising and content that's specifically for Latinos instead of simply translating (often badly) existing materials into Spanish; and talk to Latino voters about issues beyond immigration. 
Most campaigns focus their time and resources targeting Iowans who have already attended a caucus "" a group that's even whiter than the state's overall population. Across Des Moines and its suburbs, routine caucus-goers often complain of an onslaught of attention. That's not the experience of most Latinos living on the city's south side, even if many say they have heard from the Sanders campaign. 
'Where are the other campaigns?' said Joe Enriquez Henry, LULAC Iowa's political director.
Henry notes that nationally 67-percent of eligible voters are white and the percentage is lower for eligible voters who lean Democratic. 
'They need to be hearing from people of color. They need to hear about our issues,' Henry said. 'If they're not hearing us, they're not going to be prepared for the general election.' 
Under pressure to make the Iowa caucuses more inclusive, the Iowa Democratic Party has added six satellite caucus locations that will be conducted in Spanish. Some activists worry that the party is not providing enough interpreters for its regular precincts, especially those in rural areas "" giving an advantage to campaigns that have Spanish-speaking supporters already in the room. 
Misty Rebik, Sanders's Iowa director, co-founded the Center for Worker Justice of Eastern Iowa and has spent years organizing Latino workers. While the campaign has the same list of caucus-goers that most campaigns purchase from the Iowa Democratic Party, it has built its own lists of college students and Latinos. 
'It's not difficult to find pockets in communities where there's a large population from a certain ethnicity that live in that area, so it's like: Oh, okay, this is a Latino neighborhood, we're going to go to every single door here,' she said. 

Gomez, the soccer tournament organizer, moved to Iowa in 2001 on a tourist visa, was a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipient and hopes to soon become a citizen like his wife. He keeps fliers on the counter at his family's tire shop and talks with customers about the caucuses.
'My dad was kind of annoyed. . . . There's a couple times when he was like: 'Hey, you're going to scare off our customers. You shouldn't be so political in here.' But this is stuff that's real life, it goes beyond a conversation about politicians. It's about the things that help our community and will affect my kids when they grow up,' said Gomez, 31, whose children are 6 and 1. 
Supporters are encouraged to wear their 'Bernie gear' whenever possible and engage those who comment on it. Mara Ramirez, 19, was working a shift at Starbucks, and she complimented a customer on his Bernie T-shirt. The-customer enthusiastically pitched her on attending a caucus.
'I told him I'm scared to go because I've never been to one. . . . But he seemed really happy and positive about it. It felt like a lot of people like him are going to be there, so it sounds friendly and-open, so I might as well go,' said Ramirez, who is bringing a friend.

Like many Sanders supporters "" Latino and not "" Ramirez is in part drawn by his calls for Medicare-for-all and free public education. She is studying to be a nurse at the community college and works full time "" 25 hours a week at Starbucks and waitressing at a family restaurant. She pays about $3,000 a semester for tuition, taking out about $1,000 in loans each semester. Her siblings have warned her against taking on debt, but she thinks the investment is worth it. 
While all of the candidates have offered plans for making college more affordable, only Sanders and Warren have proposed making public higher education free for all, while wiping out student loan debt. 
Alicia Carranza, 20, went to the University of Iowa for a year and dropped out because of the stress of trying to pay for it. She's now an assistant manager of a grocery store and has about $8,000 in loans from those two semesters; she can only afford to pay the interest each month. 
Carranza went to high school in the small town of Murray in southwestern Iowa, and tears come to her eyes as she recounts the debates her classmates would have about immigration. Of the 27 students in her graduating class, she said, 20 were Trump supporters.

'There was just one day when . . . I was sitting in there crying because they were saying things about immigration, saying just really rude things, knowing who I was,' said Carranza, who now lives in Grimes, a Des Moines suburb.
In 2016, her class held a mock caucus "" but only for the Republican candidates. Sanders's message resonated with her then and still does. She plans to caucus for him on Monday, as long as she can get to her precinct in time after work. Last weekend, she attended a Sanders rally in Perry, where a third of the population is Latino. 
She sat behind the senator as he spoke, and he patted her shoulder as he took the stage. Carranza also got to see one of her idols: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who has been campaigning with Sanders. 
'She's like everything I want to be,' Carranza said, a sentiment echoed by many Sanders supporters. 
Ramirez proudly noted that Ocasio-Cortez was once a waitress like her, and Gomez took his daughter to an event with the congresswoman and told the 6-year-old: 'Look, it's someone like you.'
On Thursday night, the campaign hosted a concert on the south side of Des Moines that featured Las Cafeteras, a Chicano band from East Los Angeles whose music explores the immigrant experience, politics and civil rights movements.
The band changed some of its lyrics to honor Sanders, and the singers kept reminding the audience of the upcoming caucuses. 
'It's 2020, y'all,' Hector Paul Flores said at one point. 'And we can't look to anyone to do it for us.'

DES MOINES "" Jane Bloodworth will attend her first Iowa caucus on Monday night, and like many Iowans, she has taken seriously the responsibility that goes with being among those who will cast the first votes of the 2020 election. In this campaign year, making a decision has been harder than ever, for her and for so many others in this state.
Never in recent years have there been so many Iowa voters who are either undecided or who say they could change their minds before Monday night, whether activists or sometime caucus attendees. Iowans are weighing head versus heart, ideology versus electability, issues versus character and experience. It has kept everyone on edge on the eve of the caucuses.
Some of these undecided voters may forgo the caucuses on Monday night, willing to let others winnow the field further and prepared to support the eventual nominee against President Trump in November. Others will enter still trying to decide which candidate they should get behind, and some of those will try to read the room as the caucus process unfolds, looking for the best way to make a mark. Should they go for a front-runner or throw their support behind someone who needs some help to gain a delegate? 
Among half a dozen or so Iowans who identified as undecided in early January, most, like Bloodworth, know what they plan to do "" but in some cases only after agonizing over the choice.
On the first weekend in January, Bloodworth was one of the thousands and thousands of Iowans who were still making up their minds. On that Saturday, she was at an event for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in the town of Manchester, population 5,200. 

She was looking for a candidate who could address the two biggest issues of concern to her: climate change and 'the issue of people left behind' and struggling to have a full life with economic security. She can see in her own family, she said, the economic strains that many middle- and working-class families face today.
'I'm fine,' said Bloodworth, 70, who moved to Iowa in the summer of 2018 after 15 years at the World Bank in Washington. 'I'll get through this, but I worry about those who come after us. The gap [between the rich and the middle class] is bigger than ever.'
Warren was not the only candidate she was looking at. Over months, she went to events featuring Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former vice president Joe Biden, former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), businessman Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. She went once to see John Delaney, the former Maryland congressman who quit the race last week. 
'I had a pretty good sampling of all of them,' she said on Sunday morning. As she spoke, Bloodworth was in her car, heading to spend the day as an extra in a movie about girls six-on-six basketball. 

Though she started the year undecided, by Sunday, she was a decided voter "" or at least a mostly decided voter. 'I think I'm going to go for Warren,' she said. 'I like her ideas. I like her platform. I love her enthusiasm and I feel like she's got the history to get things accomplished.'
Bloodworth considers herself a conservative liberal and was drawn to the ideas of both Warren and Sanders. But Sanders's demeanor left her with reservations, particularly how he handled the dust-up with Warren over whether a woman could be elected president. 'The way he responded to that, to me, was, well . . . like an angry old man,' she said.
She thought Buttigieg has good ideas but lacks the experience needed to get things done in Washington. As for Biden, she said, 'He brings experience and has done all kinds of things, but I don't know that what we need is more of the Obama era, which he seems to talk about a lot. And Obama's not going to be there. He would have to do it on his own.'
Joyce Steffen, 70, who lives in Cedar Rapids and works in real estate, began the year undecided. As the campaign unfolded over the past year, she looked seriously at Biden and Warren before settling on Klobuchar in the past few days. 'I think it's because I decided to go with what's in my heart,' she said. 
Steffen said she believes Klobuchar can beat Trump, that she has been consistent and has more experience than some others, like Buttigieg. She said that Warren's liberal policies worried her, as did Biden's age. 'It would it have been better the last time,' she said, referring to Biden's decision not to run for president in 2016. 
Deb Tunwall, 52, of Cedar Rapids, has been thinking about what candidate could win over her husband, who has voted Republican in the past and whom she hopes to persuade to vote for the Democrat in this election year. They are considering Klobuchar and Yang. She is drawn more to Klobuchar but her husband finds Yang's ideas appealing.
'Amy I feel like can just walk in there on day one,' she said. 'I feel like she can definitely reach across the aisle. I feel like she's less polarizing than Elizabeth Warren. I feel Amy doesn't have that polarization, that she could gather a lot of moderates. My husband is my litmus test.'

She worries about Biden being strong enough to take on Trump. 'I do feel he had his time,' she said. 'The Obama supporters who voted for Trump did so because they didn't want to go back to the Obama era.' 
Tunwall raised another concern about the former vice president: that Trump will pummel him over Ukraine, despite the fact that many of Trump's claims have been debunked, the same way candidate Trump attacked Hillary Clinton over emails in 2016 "" 'a repeat of 'lock her up,' ' she said.
Asked whether she would support the Democratic nominee, whoever it is, she replied, 'Absolutely. I'm just worried my husband won't.'
Bob and Jo Rod, both 88, live in Ames. Both had supported Sanders 'big time' four years ago. 'We worked really hard for him,' she said. This time around, they see Sanders as too old, and they plan to caucus for Buttigieg, the youngest candidate in the field. Their decision came on Friday and only after 'a real struggle.'
Warren has been a favorite of theirs for some years. They attended an event for her when she was running for Senate, and 'she blew us away.' But Buttigieg's vigor and intellect ultimately led them to him. 'I like his energy and his ideas,' she said. 'He can talk off the top of his head very quickly and answers questions well.'
Sanders, who got nearly half the vote here four years ago, has lost some of those supporters, like the Rods. But of all the candidates, his loyalists might be the most committed, which is why other campaigns worry that he could turn out the most people on Monday, although the turnout battle will rage all through the day.
Margaret Damge, 72, a retired farmer who also worked for a phone company, came to see Biden in Independence the first weekend of the new year. Then, she said, she was undecided. This weekend, she settled on the former vice president. 'He's pretty consistent,' she said. 'He doesn't flip-flop, and he doesn't promise more than he's going to deliver. He's got a record.'
But Damge said she won't be able to caucus for Biden on Monday, as she is in Florida. 'I've done it every year,' she said. 'I'm going to the beach.' Asked what her absence might mean for her candidate, she laughed. 'I think Biden's going to do just fine. People are going to be saying, 'Who can beat that orange-faced guy?' '

An insurgent candidate at odds with party elites attempts to seize the nomination from establishment rivals: That infighting roiling the Democratic presidential race is playing out in this week's Super Tuesday congressional primaries.
Just as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is rankling moderate Democrats in his quest for the presidency, two Texas House candidates - one a Democrat, the other a Republican - have crossed swords with party regulars in their bid to unseat veteran incumbents. The same dynamic exists in a pair of Democratic Senate primaries, in North Carolina and Texas.
All told, while Sanders's performance might headline Super Tuesday's results, the down-ballot races could say just as much about the present willingness of each party's voters to eschew pragmatists and dealmakers for more ideologically driven candidates.
No race is being more closely watched on Capitol Hill than the Democratic primary in Texas's 28th Congressional District, where Rep. Henry Cuellar is seeking nomination to a ninth term representing a heavily Latino swath stretching from the Rio Grande to the San Antonio suburbs.
Cuellar is one of the most conservative members of the House Democratic Caucus; he once backed Republican George W. Bush's presidential bid and has more recently stumped for GOP House colleagues while voting against some of his party's signature legislative efforts.
But party leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), have rallied around him - fearful that a win by challenger Jessica Cisneros could boost the threats to other incumbents, including a trio of powerful committee chairmen who are facing challenges from younger, more liberal candidates this year - Reps. Eliot L. Engel (N.Y.) of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.) of the Judiciary Committee, and Richard E. Neal (Mass.) of the Ways and Means Committee.
Cisneros, a 26-year-old human rights attorney, has cast Cuellar as too conservative for an overwhelmingly Democratic district - one that voted for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump by 20 points in the 2016 presidential race. She has won endorsements from Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and other leading lights of the left.
In a call with reporters Friday arranged by Emily's List, the influential Democratic women's group that has endorsed her, Cisneros played down the ideological dimensions of the primary clash and said her campaign was ""about true representation for border communities.""
""We're still left out of so many decisions and policies that are coming from Washington,"" she said.
Also in the crosshairs Tuesday is Rep. Kay Granger (R-Tex.), a former Fort Worth mayor who has risen up the ranks of the House Appropriations Committee since her initial 1996 election to become the top Republican on the powerful panel - and by extension, one of the most powerful GOP women in the House.
But her role as a senior appropriator - one who has had to cut deals with Democrats to pass jam-packed spending bills - has earned her the enmity of her party's fiscal purists and an aggressive primary challenge in the North Texas-based 12th District from businessman Chris Putnam, who has also highlighted her past position as a supporter of abortion rights.
Putnam's challenge has been amplified by national conservative groups that see a chance to harden the GOP against government spending by ousting a top appropriator. The anti-tax Club for Growth calls the race a ""Republican Upgrade Opportunity"" and has funneled more than $1 million into the race.
Endorsing Putnam earlier this year, club president David M. McIntosh noted derisively that Granger was a 12-term incumbent and had ""recklessly voted for out-of-control deficit-spending, backroom bloated budget deals, and debt limit increases.""
Voters, he added, ""deserve a fiscal conservative with a voting record to match.""
Granger said in an interview that she has tried to sell voters on the importance of her position as a senior appropriator - as well as her December endorsement from President Trump, which has done little to stop Putnam's claims that he would be the more reliable vote for Trump's agenda.
""I didn't expect a primary challenge to try to take out someone in my position, Republican by another Republican,"" Granger said. ""It does take me by surprise. We should be trying to get the majority back instead of taking out the people who are here.""

Karin Dyer, a Putnam campaign spokeswoman, blasted Granger's ""long record of betraying Republican values during her 24 years in office"" and promoted Putnam's status as ""a business outsider that is being attacked by the political establishment, just like President Trump.""

""President Trump needs real allies in Washington, not just ones that show up during campaign season,"" she said.
Granger has outraised Putnam by nearly $1.5 million, according to campaign finance reports filed in mid-February, but the spending gap narrowed thanks to the Club for Growth's spending as well as another $1.1 million spent against Granger from the conservative Protect Freedom PAC.
 The Congressional Leadership Fund, the biggest Republican super PAC focused exclusively on House races, made a rare detour into a primary race, spending $1.3 million to help Granger fend off the Club for Growth's attacks.
Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a veteran appropriator and a former national campaign chairman for the House GOP, said the race is being closely watched by House leaders and senior lawmakers who fear that governance could suffer if Granger is ousted.
""If all of sudden somebody who supported the president is vulnerable in a primary because they cast tough spending votes, then there won't be nearly as many people supporting the president when he has to cut a deal, and that's when Kay's been there,"" he said. ""You're not helping build a Republican majority and you're not helping the president by beating people like Kay Granger.""
Intraparty tensions are also at play in a pair of Senate primaries in North Carolina and Texas. Democratic Party leaders in Washington are bracing for a close race in the Tar Heel State between their favored candidate, former state senator Cal Cunningham, and a more liberal candidate, state Sen. Erica Smith.
Adding to the intrigue: A super PAC with ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) admitted last week to spending $3 million on a covert effort to boost Smith - a bid to force Cunningham and his Democratic allies to spend down their campaign accounts, if not eliminate him from the general election entirely.
And in Texas, military veteran M.J. Hegar won plaudits for a strong 2018 House campaign and has, like Cunningham, won the endorsement of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. But she has struggled to break out amid challenges from labor organizer Cristina Tzintzún Ramirez, state Sen. Royce West, former congressman Chris Bell and Houston City Council member Amanda Edwards, among others. 
While Cisneros's run has invited comparisons to Ocasio-Cortez's 2018 upset of Rep. Joseph Crowley (N.Y.), then the Democratic Caucus chairman, the comparisons may be superficial. Cuellar, 64, has taken a much more aggressive approach to his campaign than Crowley did, engaging in a ground effort that his allies say is in much closer touch with a politically liberal but culturally conservative district than Cisneros is.
That includes a major fundraising push, drawing heavily on allies in the business world. As of mid-February, the most recent filing deadline, Cuellar had already spent $2.2 million, with another $2 million left in his campaign coffers, while Cisneros spent more than $1 million. Texas Forward, a super PAC supporting Cisneros, has spent another $1.3 million, while unions have added another $200,000 in spending on her behalf.
Supporting Cuellar have been a pair of typically Republican groups: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and American for Prosperity Action, the campaign arm of the conservative network overseen by industrialist Charles Koch.
Cuellar campaign spokesman Colin Strother said a victory would send a message that ""we are a big-tent party.""
""No faction of four or five people and a couple of PACs are going to perform purification rituals on this caucus,"" Strother said. ""When we have the gavel and we have the speaker, it's because we have a diverse caucus filled with moderates and conservatives.""
For Pelosi, who visited Cuellar's hometown of Laredo last month for a high-profile fundraiser, the imperative is simple: Stop an insurrection before it spreads, thus insulating other incumbents from costly challenges. 
""My role is to win the House for the Democrats and to do so by winning for our incumbents,"" she said Friday. ""I would like them to get a nice win so that there's a message for the future, for the next election and the rest - that would be that members who come here, who help us win the majority, will have the support of the leadership of the House.""
Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D), who represents a neighboring South Texas district, was even more pointed, saying he hoped a Cuellar win would send the message ""that New York and Massachusetts and California don't dictate politics in South Texas"" - referring to Cisneros's high-profile endorsers.

""We're Democrats, strong Democrats, but we're just a little more moderate than other parts of the country,"" he said before echoing a point made by allies of both Cuellar and Granger: ""I think it's very foolish that we're wasting monumental amounts of resources that we should be using for November.""

Biden, Bloomberg round out top 3 among state's likely Democratic voters
Sen. Bernie Sanders has a narrow lead over former vice president Joe Biden and billionaire Mike Bloomberg among likely Maryland Democratic voters, capturing nearly 1 in 4 votes two months ahead of the state's presidential primary, according to a new poll by Goucher College.
Sanders (I-Vt.) was backed by 24 percent of poll respondents, compared with 18 percent for Biden. The margin of error was plus or minus 5.1 percentage points. Bloomberg, a former New York mayor, rounds out the top three finishers in the survey with 16-percent support.
Most of the rest of the crowded Democratic field "" former South Bend., Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) were in the single digits. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii) and billionaire Tom Steyer received less than 1 percent, according to the poll, which was conducted Feb. 13 to Feb. 19.
Backing for Sanders's insurgent campaign has more than doubled since a Goucher poll in September, when he was the favored candidate of 10 percent of likely Maryland Democratic voters. 
Biden and Warren, the leaders five months ago, have seen their backing plummet. Biden dropped from 33-percent to 18-percent, and Warren has gone from 21-percent to 6-percent.
Mileah Kromer, director of Goucher's Sarah T. Hughes Field Politics Center, said Sanders's slight lead in Maryland reflects his recent wins in New Hampshire and Nevada. But he also may be benefiting from facing multiple opponents who are somewhat more moderate, and who are each capturing shares of the centrist Democratic vote.
Sanders was trounced by former secretary of state Hillary Clinton in Maryland's 2016 Democratic presidential primary, losing by a margin of about 2 to 1.
'People are beginning to look at Sanders as a front-runner,' said Kromer, noting that the Goucher poll was taken after Sanders dominated in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. The survey was completed before he won Saturday's Nevada caucuses, capturing nearly half the vote.
The poll found that 47-percent of likely Democratic voters say it is more important to find a candidate who is likely to defeat President Trump, while 39-percent said finding a candidate who they most identify with on issues was more important.
Nearly all of the candidates were viewed favorably by likely Democratic voters, with Sanders topping the list at 74-percent favorable. Despite Warren's low support in the poll, 67-percent of the voters held a favorable view of her. 
Kromer said Warren appears to have 'lost ground' in Maryland in part because she failed to place at the top in Iowa, New Hampshire or Nevada. With Maryland's primary still weeks away, Kromer noted, none of the candidates are campaigning in the state, although Bloomberg is running television ads there.

'We don't have any of the direct campaign touches in Maryland,' Kromer said. 'We have the national race reflecting on our numbers here.' 
Trump's approval numbers have not budged in Maryland, where Democrats outnumber Republicans about 2 to 1. Fewer than 1 in 3 state residents approve of the job he is doing, according to the poll.
Kromer said the president, who captured 33.9-percent of the vote in Maryland in 2016, has not expanded his base in the blue state. But Trump has the approval of about 80-percent of his own party.
Any of the Democratic candidates would win decisively against Trump in a Maryland general-election matchup, the poll found, with Sanders, Biden and Bloomberg all capturing about 60-percent support.
The poll surveyed 929 Maryland adults, including 718 likely voters and 371 likely Democratic voters.

Acquittal, economy, Iowa flop feed angst over odds of fall Democratic victory




Anxiety is coursing through the Democratic Party as President Trump emerges from his impeachment proceedings as a potent threat for reelection, with party leaders and activists uncertain about how to beat the incumbent and worried about a nominating race that remains crowded and is growing more acrimonious.
While Democrats see Trump as a corrosive figure and a threat to the nation, they also see the president and his well-funded campaign tailoring a reelection bid around the strong economy and visceral appeals to his ardent supporters.
Trump's robust political standing came into view this past week, as he claimed vindication from his acquittal in his Senate trial despite damaging House testimony about his conduct with Ukraine "" and set off on a path of retribution by ousting some officials who were witnesses. At the same time, his Gallup approval rating ticked up to 49 percent, its highest point yet.
The developments have generated convulsions of angst among Democrats, who watched their first-in-the-nation Iowa presidential caucuses conclude in a chaotic fiasco and deliver an inconclusive result. Many in the party are now sounding the alarm that denying Trump a second term could be far more difficult than they had calculated.

'We have a president who isn't merely unconventional or challenging institutions and elites, or coloring outside the lines. He's unmoored,' Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) said. Yet, Coons added, he is 'very aware' that Trump could win reelection 'with these economic numbers at his back, all as millions of Americans grow numb to his behavior.'
Since Democratic presidential hopefuls began running through the starting gates a year ago, party activists have been consumed with the question of electability "" specifically, which of the roughly two dozen initial candidates could best stack up against Trump. The result so far has been a form of paralysis, with no presumptive favorite in the race and each leading contender struggling to overcome vulnerabilities and erase doubts.
'The obsession with concocting the Frankenstein to take on Trump has confined us all,' said Jennifer Palmieri, a longtime party strategist who advised Hillary Clinton in 2016 and is not aligned with any candidate this time. 

Palmieri spent the past couple of weeks on the ground in Iowa and New Hampshire observing the candidates up close, including the president, who staged a large rally in Des Moines before the caucuses. She came away deeply concerned about her party as it grapples with how to counter a norm-shattering executive who relishes political combat.
'We are letting Trump drive our process and getting ourselves all tangled up in who might be the best person to foil him,' Palmieri said. 'That became really clear to me just being in Iowa. The voters were so lost. They didn't have any orientation, no grounding. . . . They felt paralyzed by this choice.'



Former Ohio governor Ted Strickland, a supporter of former vice president Joe Biden, agreed: 'The party is torn. It's polarized about what it wants to do. There is a world of difference between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden and no one really knows which way it's going to go "" and you have Pete Buttigieg, a talent, in the mix, and Mike Bloomberg rearing his head here before Super Tuesday.'
Many Democrats lament that they feel stuck in a cycle controlled by the president, with Trump shaping the contours of the race just as he did in 2016 with a blizzard of incendiary statements, lies and provocations "" and, this time, a loyal Republican Party that cheers him at every turn.
'We spend too much time chasing whatever foolishness Trump throws out there, and he's masterful at it,' said Cornell Belcher, a veteran Democratic pollster. 'This has got to be an election fundamentally about Democrats' vision for bringing the country together and solving the big problems that confront us. And if a Democrat can do that, a Democrat can have a good chance of cobbling back together and even expanding the Obama coalition "" and that will beat Trump.'

In his State of the Union address last Tuesday, Trump laid out what he sees as his road map to reelection. 
Trump boasted of his stewardship of the economy under the theme a 'great American comeback.' He threw red meat to his base, in the form of hard-line rhetoric on illegal immigration and policies on religious liberty, guns and charter schools. He made direct appeals to black voters who had shunned him in 2016 by touting his work on criminal justice reform and other issues. 
Trump also orchestrated dazzling reality-show reveals, such as first lady Melania Trump awarding talk-radio icon Rush Limbaugh the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And the president's speech featured his customary litany of false statements that outrage Democrats, such as casting himself as a guardian of health coverage for those with preexisting conditions, despite his administration's repeated efforts to repeal and gut former president Barack Obama's health-care law "" all but daring the fact-checkers to blow their whistles.

Trump's speech at the Capitol "" and an hour-plus event Thursday in the East Room of the White House where he bragged and demeaned his opponents "" has created more urgency than ever among some Democrats about calling out Trump or else risk having him define the terms of debate. 
'We've got to be a little more dramatic about exposing him,' Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said. 'You can't just be anti-Trump alone. You've got to go at the truth.'
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has tried to play umpire, standing over the president's shoulder at the conclusion of his State of the Union and ripping printed pages of his prepared text because, as she later told reporters, she considered it 'a manifesto of mistruths.'

Many Democratic lawmakers celebrated Pelosi, their party's de facto leader until a presumptive presidential nominee emerges, seeing her as a forceful guide at a turbulent crossroads.
'One of Trump's real skills is that he's a fighter, and if someone is going to punch you, punch back 10 times harder,' Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.), a Pelosi ally, said. 'I like a fighter and how she stands up to him. We've worked with him on a number of issues, but you can't back down to a bully.'
Still, Trump's address was a sobering moment for Democrats.
'The last 24 hours have been a big wake-up call for Democrats. The Iowa caucus was a debacle. Then Donald Trump produced a very strong, clinical speech that shows exactly what he thinks he needs to do to win,' Van Jones, chief executive of Reform Alliance and a former Obama adviser, wrote Wednesday in an op-ed on CNN's website.
Trump is making a deliberate effort to court minority voters. During last weekend's Super Bowl, the president's reelection campaign aired an ad during the game's broadcast spotlighting the criminal justice law. The ad showed Alice Marie Johnson, a 64-year-old black woman from Mississippi who was freed after Trump commuted her prison sentence for a nonviolent drug offense. She is seen in the ad hugging her family and friends, thanking Trump and declaring, 'Hallelujah!'
Trump and his campaign team are banking that this kind of messaging helps him overcome his history of making racist comments and questioning Obama's love of country and credentials. He has a difficult road ahead. A recent Washington Post-Ipsos poll of black voters showed that more than 8 in 10 say they believe Trump is 'a racist,' and 9 in 10 say they disapprove of the president's performance in office. 

Republicans are eager to echo Trump as they try to chip into Democratic strongholds throughout the South and Midwest. Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), a Trump ally who is running for reelection this year, said Trump's emphasis on criminal justice reform and stoking economic opportunity for minority communities 'sure does' help his own Senate campaign in a state where black and Latino voters are pivotal.
'We've got [historically black colleges and universities], we've got criminal justice reform, we've got the economy going,' Perdue said, arguing that Trump has been the best president for the black community since Abraham Lincoln in the 1860s "" a claim that, like many of Trump's, infuriates Democrats. 
Some Democratic leaders believe their party stands the best chance of defeating Trump with a nominee who can inspire a movement of new voters to register and cast ballots in November's general election, as opposed to one focused on mobilizing existing voters. 
'The other side will try to purge the heck out of existing voters, but if you flood the zone with new voters and arm them with information, they will come out,' said Maria Teresa Kumar, president of Voto Latino. 'If I were selling Nikes, I would not go into saturated markets, because how many people will buy that fifth pair of Nikes? I'd rather go into new markets where people might say, 'Hey, I'd like to buy a pair of Nikes.''
There are tensions, however, about who is best positioned to expand the party's reach: a grass-roots liberal favorite like Sanders (I-Vt.) or Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.); a new face like Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind.; or a self-funder building a massive political machine like Bloomberg, the former New York mayor. 
Biden's weak performance in Iowa has caused particular concern among many of the party's older donors and establishment figures since they have long thought the former vice president could stitch much of the Obama coalition back together and serve as a uniting force in a party divided between left and center.
Democrats believe they retook the House majority in 2018 by focusing on health care and other pocketbook issues in suburban districts, and Pelosi has tried to keep her party following that playbook. She tweeted last week that the three most important issues to Americans are '1) Health care, 2) Health care, 3) Health care.'

But there are sharp differences of opinion on that strategy within the party. Former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, who withdrew from the presidential race last fall, said in an interview that Democrats should not stray from speaking in stark terms about Trump's conduct and the stakes for the nation, even if polling suggests they concentrate on other issues.
'There is a school of thought that you shouldn't talk about impeachment and instead talk about infrastructure and health care, as if they're mutually exclusive,' O'Rourke said. 'You can't shy away from the most obvious threat to this country, and if you do, you accept Donald Trump, and then we become complicit in it and we won't win the next election.'
O'Rourke added: 'Many are tempted to despair right now with the president being acquitted or this freak show of a presidency and the cult of personality that the Republican Party has become. But if you give into that, it's over.'
Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), a party stalwart who has been involved with presidential campaigns in her state for decades, said Democrats must keep in mind that political dynamics can quickly change.
'I remember the 1992 campaign at this point when everybody was throwing up their hands, worried that we had 'the seven dwarfs' running against George H.W. Bush,' Shaheen recalled, nodding toward the then-incumbent president's high approval ratings following the Gulf War.
'And then we won,' she said, when Bill Clinton beat Bush later that year.
Shaheen demurred when asked who is 2020's version of Bill Clinton. 
'We'll just have to find out,' she said.

WADMALAW ISLAND, S.C. "" Benjamin Gadsden was so certain that Joe Biden would be the Democratic Party's strongest nominee against President Trump.
'I think he's the best,' Gadsden, 80, said several weeks ago, citing the former vice president's long career. 'He's a seasoned politician.' 
Over the past three weeks, however, Gadsden's confidence has wilted, much like Biden's poll numbers, after disappointing showings in the first three nominating contests. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has emerged with the most delegates so far and has gained strength in South Carolina, threatening Biden's longtime lead before Saturday's primary.
'I am a bit concerned,' Gadsden, a retired warehouse worker, said in a recent interview. 'Not too long ago, he was up front, and now he's nearly on the bottom. If he doesn't turn it around pretty soon . . .'
His daughter, Tamika Gadsden, 39, is not surprised that Biden's candidacy flagged. She said his campaign had always lacked energy, relying not on passion but on long-standing support among state party leaders and on voters' fond memories of his time in the Obama administration. She tried to talk to her parents, but after some heated discussions, especially with her mother, she let it go. Still, she is not happy to see them so dispirited by Biden's struggling campaign.
Besides, her candidate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), is also struggling, and Gadsden is frustrated that there's little time left for her to pick off potential Biden defectors. 'I thought she would have done better in New Hampshire,' Gadsden said, irked that Warren is being outspent by billionaire candidates who have raised their profiles with expensive ad buys and, in the case of Tom Steyer, paid top dollar for organizers in South Carolina.
The debate among the Gadsdens and others on Wadmalaw Island, southeast of Charleston, S.C., mirrors a conversation taking place between generations of black voters across the nation. With black voters making up 60-percent of the Democratic electorate in South Carolina and a significant proportion in many Super Tuesday states, the outcome of that conflict in the next few days could prove critical to deciding the party's nomination. 


African American voters, particularly older ones like Benjamin Gadsden, have overwhelmingly supported Biden, fueling the lead he held in national polls until recently. South Carolina's black voters, in particular, were seen as his firewall, blunting anyone else's rise here. The notion that he would be able to win over white swing voters in the general election made him a reasonable choice for many black voters. 
But his support among younger black voters like Tamika Gadsden was always weaker, with many underwhelmed by his nostalgic message of returning to a pre-Trump America. For voters seeking a political leader to confront systemic racism and economic inequity, Biden's long and complicated record and some of his comments during the campaign seemed like a continuation of those institutional biases. 
Younger voters also have found Sanders and Warren as the more attractive alternatives because of their proposals for universal health care, student loan forgiveness and free college tuition, and promises to level the economic playing field.
Tamika Gadsden took advantage of early voting and cast her ballot last week for Warren. 'I see her trying to rally the troops and vowing to turn around her campaign "" and she might,' Gadsden said, adding that she has been heartened by Warren's performances in the past two debates and has not given up hope that the senator will win the nomination.
And despite his concerns, Benjamin Gadsden says he will vote for Biden. 'I'm not going to bail on him,' Gadsden said recently. 'I think Biden will have a better shot in South Carolina than he's [had] so far in Iowa and New Hampshire. But if South Carolina is going to be the only state he's depending on, it could be a problem for him. It's going to take more than South Carolina for him to get the nomination.'



Wadmalaw Island, about 23-miles south of Charleston, has roughly 5,000 residents, more than half of whom are black. After the Union Army seized South Carolina in the Civil War, white plantation owners fled the islands, leaving behind their lucrative rice fields and enslaved African Americans, many of whom were given plots of land. During Reconstruction, some owners reclaimed portions of the land, but the former slaves still established communities in which they retained their culture and sense of independence. Over time, however, economic hardship has forced many to sell their land or lose it to unscrupulous real estate agents.
Benjamin Gadsden was born on Wadmalaw. Following the path of millions of black Southerners during the first half of the past century, Gadsden headed north as a young adult, along with two older sisters who had moved to Woodbridge, N.J., during the Great Migration. Tamika Gadsden calls them 'Jim Crow refugees.'
He returned to Wadmalaw in 1996, to be close to his ailing father, with his wife, Trudy, and Tamika and her twin brother, Terence. Tamika Gadsden remembers being devastated, as most 10th-graders would be, to be uprooted from friends and favorite places and relocated to a rural landscape with one road in and out of town. She headed back to New Jersey for college and stayed after graduation, working for a time in government and in a retailer's corporate offices. Then, on a visit home several years ago, she drove over a bridge and saw sunlight dancing on the water. She decided she wanted to come home.
Gadsden is part of a reverse migration, in which African Americans are moving to the South, searching for a lower cost of living, a better quality of life and, for many, closer proximity to extended family. She lives with her mother and father in a rambler on Maybank Highway, the main thoroughfare that connects Wadmalaw and the other islands to the mainland. 
More than half of the nation's African Americans live in the South, where the Republican Party has had a lock on most political power since the 1950s. But Tamika Gadsden and others see the region on the cusp of change, pushed by its growing population of people of color. Last year, for instance, black voters along with liberal whites and Latinos and Asian Americans nominated African American Democrats for governor's races in Florida and Georgia. Both nearly upset their Republican rivals.
She has jumped into the fight, working as an organizer for Black Voters Matter, an independent group focused on educating and mobilizing African Americans in the rural South. Separately, she is among the 100 activists who endorsed Warren under the banner of Black Womxn For. She has talked up Warren's campaign on a radio show and a podcast that she hosts. 


Presidential candidates rarely venture out to Wadmalaw or neighboring islands. Voters who want to see the candidates in person usually have to go to Charleston. That's where Mildred Mitchell first saw Barack Obama. 'On January 10th. It was my birthday,' she said. 
Mitchell, a longtime friend of the Gadsdens, lives about a quarter-mile off Maybank Highway, in the country version of a cul-de-sac: A rutted dirt road, the drive even more treacherous during a rain spell, empties into a clearing with four houses. The land on which she lives has been in her husband's family for more than 80 years. Long ago, the yards would have been filled with children, but only grandparents live there now. Her grandchildren are in New York, where Mitchell lived for 47 years before moving back to Wadmalaw in 2007, just in time for Obama's historic bid.
She recalled seeing him speak for the first time. She was taken by 'his charisma . . . the way he spoke. He had a young voice. He really was a young man.' 
Mitchell, 78, a retired hospital employee, was a poll worker in 2008 and remembers the excitement "" and the tension "" around that primary, when the senator from Illinois upset Hillary Clinton, who initially had been favored to win South Carolina. She thought Obama's policies, particularly the Affordable Care Act, were good for the country, and she hates that Trump seems intent on undoing his legacy. That was why she was leaning toward Biden, even though she was concerned about his age.
His fifth-place finish in the New Hampshire primary, she said, was 'heartbreaking.'
'I want somebody that can beat Donald Trump,' she said. Right now, she is not sure who that is.
Mitchell's cousins, Mattie and her son Shawn, had never been sold on Biden.
Mattie Mitchell, 67, grew up on Wadmalaw and came back home after earning a degree from Claflin University, about 90 miles north, in Orangeburg. She taught elementary school for 40 years. Fourth grade was her favorite, she said, because that was the year she could see the children really starting to grow up.
She wants a president who cares about children, especially black children, who she said are being shortchanged by inequities in the public school system. 
'We need fair and equity in funding. Our schools are not being treated fairly, and it's wrong,' she said. She rejects conservative arguments for 'school choice' initiatives as a solution. 'If you make all schools the same, you don't need choice,' she said.


In December, Mattie Mitchell said, she was still looking over the candidates. As much as she admired Obama, particularly his fight to push through the Affordable Care Act, she didn't see that as a reason to automatically support Biden.
'I will judge Biden by what he's going to bring to the table, how he's going to help the American people,' she said.
Mitchell, who now lives in Charleston, said in a recent interview she thought the attention to Biden's son Hunter's work in Ukraine had hurt the former vice president, and she's now leaning toward Sanders. She likes his call for canceling student debt and his Medicare-for-all proposal. 
'I could still change my mind,' she cautioned, although she said she's ruled out Warren because she doesn't think a woman can win in the nation's toxic political climate, and she doesn't know enough about Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind. She said she is skeptical of billionaires Steyer and Mike Bloomberg, who is not on the South Carolina primary ballot.
'I don't know if they really realize what it's like for the people, the underdogs, who really need all this help,' she said. 'I don't know if they really understand the needs of our people.'
Her son Shawn Mitchell, 33, said he found Bloomberg's sudden visibility, particularly his ubiquitous ads on TV and social media, disconcerting. He was offended by ads that both the former New York mayor and Trump ran around the Super Bowl that featured the stories of black women who had experienced trauma and had been helped by the politicians.
'I was like, so are we going to try to put up a liberal billionaire against a conservative billionaire?' Mitchell said. 
Early on, he said, he supported Sanders because of his promise to forgive student loans. Mitchell finished dentistry school in 2014 with debt that was so high he couldn't get financing to open a practice in his hometown. He resorted to crowdfunding to help pay down his student debt, which allowed him to get the business loan he needed to start his practice, Sweetgrass Dental Associates, which opened in January in North Charleston.
Bloomberg's rise in the contest reminded him of his residency in New York, where he was stopped a few times by police. Mitchell said he cannot abide Bloomberg's candidacy because of his mayoral policy that prompted police to stop and frisk residents "" mostly young, nonwhite men. Just as worrisome, he said, is the notion that the presidency is for sale. 
'I know people have their gripes with Bernie because of the socialist label. I still agree with him. He evens the playing field for those of us who don't have power and don't have a voice,' Mitchell said. His wife, Myriam, and 30-year-old twin brothers, Trevor and Julian, also are with Sanders.


The Wadmalaw families have one thing in common: None expressed excitement about their choices, even as all vow to vote. They said they were frustrated by the large, chaotic field of candidates, although Tamika Gadsden said she liked the variety. Mostly, they said, they felt a duty to participate in the election and a desire to defeat Trump. But there is no swooning like they all recalled from 2008, when they helped boost Obama's candidacy at a critical moment. 
Benjamin Gadsden shrugged off one of the criticisms of Biden "" his occasional racial insensitivity, particularly in the past. 
He had never even heard of most of the other candidates, except for Sanders, and he hadn't heard of him before 2016. He believes people can change, and he doesn't think Obama would have chosen Biden as his vice president 'if he was so bad in that area.'
'Show me the perfect man,' he said. He added, 'White folks, in general, are not 100 percent in our corner. I don't care how much they try to portray that image, they are not 100 percent for us.'
Gadsden blamed 'bickering' among the Democratic candidates and Republican investigations into Hunter Biden for having 'knocked Biden off course.' Now he is worried that his worst fears will come true. 
'I do not have any desire to see Trump coming back,' he said. 'But as it stands now, I think he's a shoo-in.'
Tamika Gadsden said she thinks black voters should demand better. That's why she's backing Warren, who has talked about issues that affect black women specifically, like the racial disparity in maternal mortality and workplace salaries. 
Looking back, Tamika questioned how much Obama did to challenge and change systemic racial disparities in the criminal justice, economic and educational systems. But she said his election was an important cultural victory "" an affirming image of a black family and black achievement.
Tamika said she is not dispirited by the upheaval of the current field.
'I think black people aren't expecting perfection; there's no perfect candidate, but I think that, honestly, we've got more choices than we've ever had,' she said. 'I think people keep offering these hot takes as opposed to looking at this as a remarkable moment. . . . I think we still have a lot of candidates to choose from.'

State Democratic officials are under fire as top candidates claim victory

A top Democratic official said Thursday he had warned Iowa Democrats last month against using an untested app to transmit returns in the Iowa caucuses, whose results were thrown into further disarray as the party's national leader called for a recanvass.
Jim Roosevelt, co-chairman of the Democratic National Committee's powerful Rules and Bylaws Committee, said he and a colleague raised concerns over the phone with Troy Price, the chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, and that Price assured them the app had been properly vetted.
'We said, 'At scale?' ' Roosevelt recounted of the January conversation. 'He said yes. But it turns out it's not the case.' 
That warning, which has not been previously reported, raises new questions about the decision-making of the Iowa Democratic Party in planning for its high-stakes caucuses, which have been engulfed in uncertainty since the app broke down on caucus night. A spokeswoman for Price said the state party chairman did not remember such a call.
Democrats had hoped Thursday to finalize the Iowa results so they could move ahead with choosing a nominee to take on President Trump. Instead, the chaos continued as a breach opened between national and state Democrats, inaccuracies continued to emerge and two candidates seized on the results to claim victory.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) argued "" at a time Thursday afternoon when 97-percent of precincts had been counted "" that it was clear he got more votes than anyone else.

'When 6,000 more people come out for you in an election than your nearest opponent, we here in northern New England call that a victory,' Sanders said while campaigning in New Hampshire. When Iowa Democratic officials on Thursday night released 100-percent of the precincts, his campaign said the update 'confirms' his victory.
 Former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, had proclaimed victory Monday night with no official results reported. During an appearance on ABC's 'The View' Thursday morning, he characterized the race as 'neck-and-neck.' But on Thursday night, his campaign also claimed he had won.
Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, signaled he was losing patience with the confusion and the Iowa party's handling of it.
'Enough is enough,' Perez tweeted. 'In light of the problems that have emerged in the implementation of the delegate selection plan and in order to assure public confidence in the results, I am calling on the Iowa Democratic Party to immediately begin a recanvass.'

The state party gave no indication it planned to honor Perez's demand, instead issuing a statement noting that it is the campaigns that are entitled to request a recanvass. None has so far made such a request, and Sanders and Buttigieg indicated Thursday they would not. 
A recanvass would mean a hand audit of the math worksheets and reporting forms that are completed on caucus night at each of the more than 1,750 precincts across the state. It would differ from a full recount, which involves a hand count of each of the 'presidential preference cards' completed by caucus-goers.
The state party, in new measures for 2020, introduced an opportunity for campaigns to request a recanvass, or a recount if necessary, if they could show that new figures could alter the allocation of delegates to the Democratic National Convention.

Any campaign requesting a recanvass would have to pay for it. Party rules do not specify what happens if a third party, such as Perez, intervenes.
Perez's comment arose from widespread concerns about lingering uncertainties in Iowa, including on whether new figures from the state's 'satellite' caucuses square with guidelines for allocating delegates, according to a Democratic official who was not authorized to speak publicly.
More than 1,500 caucus-goers participated at these alternative locations, which are designed for Spanish speakers, night workers and others who have trouble attending a traditional caucus. The satellite caucuses were introduced for the first time this year.
It's not the first time tensions have erupted between national and Iowa Democrats over competing pressure for access, security and efficiency in the caucuses. Last year, the DNC effectively rejected a plan for 'virtual caucuses,' because of fears that the mobile software could not be secured against hacking.
Democrats had hoped Monday's caucuses would mark the triumphant launch of their effort to oust a president they despise and provide clarity to an unwieldy field.
Instead, three days later the party found itself with two candidates, Sanders and Buttigieg, with bragging rights. Sanders led in the popular vote by 2,631 votes on Thursday night, but Buttigieg had a narrow lead in the percentage of delegates won, at 26.2 percent to Sanders's 26.1 percent. 
At a news conference in Manchester, N.H., Sanders said Buttigieg's edge in state delegates was 'meaningless.' More important, he said, were delegates to the national convention, where the two would derive equivalent backing from Iowa.
But the key outcome, he said, was that more Iowans had chosen him than any of the other candidates. 
'What I want to do today, three days late, is to thank the people of Iowa for the very strong victory they gave us at the Iowa caucuses on Monday night,' Sanders said. 

Buttigieg, at a stop in Merrimack, N.H., said his campaign had been 'absolutely electrified … by the extraordinary validation of this campaign's vision that we had in Iowa on Monday.' 
Still, he added, 'I'm also mindful and humbled by the fact that New Hampshire is New Hampshire. And New Hampshire is not the kind of place to let Iowa or anybody else tell you what to do.' 
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and former vice president Joe Biden have lagged behind Sanders and Buttigieg as the Iowa results have unfolded, putting pressure on their campaigns to bolster their showing in New Hampshire.
At least one contender was willing to accept Sanders's claim. 'It sure looks like Bernie won Iowa,' business executive Andrew Yang tweeted. 'Excited to compete for the win in New Hampshire on Tuesday!' 
So even while the Iowa chaos continued, the presidential hopefuls forged ahead in that state with an eye toward Tuesday's primary. A new Monmouth University poll showed Sanders and Buttigieg on strong footing in New Hampshire, at 24 percent and 20 percent, respectively, in a survey with a margin of error of four percentage points. Biden, who described his fourth-place finish in Iowa as a 'gut punch,' registered at 17 percent, and Warren was at 13 percent. 
New Hampshire gained in salience as the closely watched contest in Iowa remained muddled. The caucuses were thrown into confusion Monday night as candidates and caucus-goers waited for results that never came, and it soon emerged that the mobile app hastily built to transmit precinct returns to the state party had failed. 
A backup hotline for calling in the results then became overloaded "" at least partly because of prank calls placed by Trump supporters, according to Mandy McClure, a spokeswoman for the Iowa Democratic Party. Quickly, the caucuses held out by Iowa Democrats as a model of participatory democracy became a lesson in the perils of conducting elections in the digital age. 
The Iowa Democratic Party had initially solicited bids jointly for the mobile app and for its 'virtual caucuses,' which would have allowed Iowans to participate by phone and was later canceled.
The party initially hoped to identify a vendor for both as early as May 2019, according to an individual familiar with the request. 
When plans for the virtual caucuses were scrapped in September, the state party pressed ahead with its aim to build a mobile app for transmitting results, as it had done in 2016. But it was only at the last minute that it was able to complete a contract with a Democratic-aligned start-up, Shadow Inc., to build the app, handing over about $63,000 in two installments in November and December. 
But secrecy surrounded the process. The state party kept the name of the developer private and delayed the app's rollout to guard against hacking, according to an official with the Iowa Democrats who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. And Roosevelt, the DNC's Rules and Bylaws co-chairman, said state party leaders would not reveal who had vetted the software. 
Roosevelt said that when he raised concerns with Bob Lord, the DNC's chief security officer, Lord told him the app was not a severe cybersecurity risk because it would be used only for transmitting results, not voting. The national party saw the functionality of the reporting app as the responsibility of the state party and its vendor, according to a Democratic official familiar with the matter.
The Iowa Democratic Party now plans to bring in a third-party group to examine what went wrong with the technology, said Jean Pardee, a member of the party's state central committee, whose members participated in a conference call Wednesday. 
Iowa Democrats reiterated that however problematic the delays, the reliability of the results is beyond dispute. 'Maybe efficiency and timeliness are fair critiques, but the integrity of this caucus has never been in question,' said Jim Mowrer, former vice-chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party. 
But Sanders joined the growing list of prominent Democrats sharply criticizing the Iowa party's performance.
'That screw-up has been extremely unfair to the people of Iowa,' Sanders said. 'It has been unfair to the candidates "" all of the candidates "" and all of their supporters.'

Over mounting costs, a stark divide forthe 2020 candidates
In 2019, Democrats running for president announced a slate of multitrillion-dollar proposals aimed at transforming the country and combating the economic and social ills they blame for giving rise to President Trump. 
But as the year comes to a close, the mounting price tag of those plans has become a point of contention between the liberal and moderate wings of the party. 
'No one inside the Beltway seems to ask how much the status quo costs,' Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wrote Thursday on Twitter, defending his proposals by citing estimates of deaths caused by air pollution and a lack of health care. 'We have the resources "" and a moral obligation "" to pass Medicare for All and a Green New Deal.'
Sanders's agenda would cost more than $50 trillion over 10 years, more than the plans of any other Democratic candidate. Like the others, he would pay for his plans by raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy. 
As Democrats seek to appeal to a broad swath of voters, candidates are airing proposals that include government-supported health care and child care, free college, student loan forgiveness, transformative climate policies, massive pay raises for teachers, and a universal basic income, among others.
 A Washington Post review of the major spending proposals of the leading Democratic presidential candidates found 10-year costs ranging from about $4 trillion to more than $50 trillion. The annual federal budget now is about $4.5 trillion.
Even the most sparse of the 2020 plans dwarfs what successful Democrats pushed before. As she seized the Democratic nomination in 2016, Hillary Clinton proposed a 10-year agenda estimated at $1.45 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
The rapidly rising price tags and expansive reach of the current plans has led to charges of socialism from Republicans. But in recent weeks, more-moderate Democrats have been the most vocal critics of their liberal colleagues' spending plans. 
'On issue after issue, we've got to break out of the Washington mind-set that measures the bigness of an idea by how many trillions of dollars it adds to the budget or the boldness of an idea by how many fellow Americans it can antagonize,' South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said during the Democratic presidential debate this month in Los Angeles.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who has said her priority as president would be a $1 trillion infrastructure program, has questioned the practicality of her competitors' more expensive proposals.
'Where I disagree is, I just don't think anyone has a monopoly on bold ideas,' she said during the debate. 'I think you can be progressive and practical at the same time.'
The Post analysis focused only on the broad categories of health care, housing, the environment, criminal justice, education, child care and other anti-poverty initiatives. Using self-reported estimates from the campaigns of the candidates leading nationally and in early states "" Sanders, Buttigieg, former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) "" the review found a shared desire to strengthen the social safety net, enlarge the federal government and reduce inequality. But each arrived at different ways of doing so, with varying price tags.
Sanders, for example, would increase minimum salaries for teachers to $60,000 and provide free breakfast and lunch to every public school student in the country, as part of an agenda that tops $51 trillion over 10 years. Among a set of plans with a total 10-year cost exceeding $30 trillion, Warren proposes subsidizing child care for almost all Americans and reducing rental costs nationwide by 10 percent.
Biden's agenda, a more moderate set of proposals costing more than $4.1 trillion over 10 years, calls for tripling funding at low-income schools and making community college free. 
Buttigieg, who unveiled a $1.1-trillion 10-year economic plan in November, now has spelled out more than $5.5 trillion in federal initiatives. He has criticized Warren and Sanders for their free college programs that would provide a universal benefit, regardless of income. 
Trump has seized on the Democrats' spending proposals and led the GOP characterization of them as socialists. He has warned that the true outcome of Democrats' plans would be higher taxes.
'They say, 'We're going to give away your health care. We're going to do free education. We're going to cut student loan debt down to nothing,' ' Trump said in September during a speech to the House Republican Conference in Baltimore. 'Everything is given away.'
Yet Trump signed a $1.4 trillion spending bill this month that will add more red ink to the record $23 trillion national debt. Republicans' signature legislative achievement under Trump, a massive 2017 tax cut whose benefits skewed toward corporations and the wealthy, has helped pushed the annual federal deficit past $1 trillion.
But many Republicans, following Trump's lead, have largely abandoned the concerns about debt and deficits they expressed during President Barack Obama's tenure. 


Democrats have likewise felt free to sidestep discussions about the $23 trillion national debt during their primary contest, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.
'The fetters around fiscal responsibility have been thrown off,' said Zandi, who has analyzed the spending plans of several Democratic presidential candidates. 'There's no real political constituency for fiscal discipline either on the Republican or Democratic side.'
Indeed, several trailing Democratic candidates have, like Klobuchar and Biden, been critical of the spending surge "" but have found voters largely shrugging off their concerns.
Other lower-polling candidates in the historically large primary also have built their candidacies around costly and ambitious initiatives.
Entrepreneur Andrew Yang has backed a universal basic income of $12,000 per year for every American adult, which he estimated would cost $2.4 trillion per year "" or $24 trillion over 10 years. He has also proposed giving $100 in 'Democracy Dollars' for every American voter to use to participate in the political system. 
Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) has proposed 'baby bonds' for every newborn. Several candidates have expressed openness to the idea of providing reparations to the descendants of enslaved Americans.
For his part, Trump has boasted at rallies about spending trillions of dollars on the military and giving more than $28 billion in payouts to farmers affected by the trade war he sparked with China and other countries. Speaking to a conservative group in West Palm Beach, Fla., on Dec. 21, Trump praised his administration for securing more than $2.5-trillion in military spending, dismissing the idea that the increased funding had added to the growing budget deficit. 
'Let me tell you about budgets: I'm a big budget person, but when it comes to the military, there is no budget,' he said.
-In his 2016 campaign, Trump differed from other Republicans by brushing aside proposals to curb Social Security and Medicare spending, which members of his party had long argued were necessary to halt runaway deficits. He has pledged to get serious about fiscal discipline and reducing the deficit if reelected, but his campaign has not put forward a plan to cut spending. 
Democrats have said Trump's 2016 election and the policies he's pursued while in office require bold countermeasures that will level the playing field for middle-class Americans. They've sought to outdo one another by targeting primary voters concerned about issues including systemic racism, climate change and education.
An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released this month found that 56 percent of Democratic primary voters prefer candidates who propose 'large scale policies that cost more' compared with 38 percent who like candidates pitching less-expensive policies that would bring less change but potentially be easier to pass into law.
With just a few weeks before primary voting begins, some of the more-moderate candidates are increasingly hopeful voters will be repelled by the rising price tags of the most ambitious proposals. Biden, who is leading the national race in most polls and leads with voters who prefer smaller-scale change, has repeatedly challenged his rivals to explain how they would pay for their spending programs.
Warren has been the most detailed in outlining the costs of her various plans and how she would pay for them. With a 2 percent 'wealth tax' on fortunes exceeding $50 million and other tax hikes on the wealthy, Warren has said she would be able to fund a broad expansion of the federal government's social contract without raising taxes on middle-class Americans.
Warren advanced in the polls earlier this year as she released dozens of plans offering vast benefits to most Americans by redistributing wealth that has become increasingly concentrated among the rich. 
Calculators on her campaign website allow Americans to find out how much money they would save through her plan canceling student loan debt, and how much extra cash they would receive from her proposal to provide an extra $200 monthly for everyone receiving Social Security.
Her momentum appeared to stall after she was pressured to release her own plan for universal health care. Warren's $20.5 trillion proposal, her most expensive plan yet, would be funded through an array of taxes on the wealthy and corporations.
Both Sanders and Warren, who continue to face bipartisan questions about the costs and feasibility of their health-care plans, have said most Americans would pay less for health care under a government-run system that eliminates premiums, deductibles and the private insurance companies that collect them.
But over the course of the year, several Democratic candidates backed away from Medicare-for-all, citing its requisite tax increases and its upending of the private insurance industry.
'I believe this hits the middle class too hard,' Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) wrote in July about Sanders's proposal to pay for his Medicare-for-all plan with a 4 percent income tax on most families. Harris, who had proposed an ambitious agenda estimated at more than $12.3 trillion, dropped out of the primary this month. 
In addition to his Medicare-for-all proposal eliminating out-of-pocket health-care costs, Sanders has also pledged to have the government wipe out all $1.6 trillion in outstanding student loan debt. His proposal, announced in June, went even further than Warren's pledge to eliminate debt for 95 percent of the people who have student loans.
Sanders has pledged to pay for his agenda by reversing Trump's tax cuts and imposing a wealth tax and a series of tax hikes on the finance industry and more. He has acknowledged that his health-care plan would raise taxes on middle-class Americans, but he insists that would be offset by the trimmed costs.
Candidates have also touted 13-figure price tags as they've competed to show their visions for combating climate change.
Warren's $3 trillion plans include a tenfold increase in federal spending on clean-energy research and development. She also proposed a $10.7 trillion 'green jobs plan' to invest in environmentally friendly industries. Buttigieg's $1.5 trillion plan creates a national extreme weather insurance program. Biden's $1.7 trillion plan aims to achieve net zero emissions of carbon pollution by 2050. 
Sanders has boasted that his plan, the most expensive at $16.3 trillion, would declare climate change a national emergency, eliminate fracking, and ban all imports and exports of fossil fuels.
Several candidates have pushed ahead with expensive plans by arguing that the cost of not acting far exceeds the price tag for their proposals.
'My opponents and critics say, 'Bernie, you're proposing to spend a lot of money on climate,' ' Sanders said recently at a rally in Los Angeles. 'And I say, 'What is the alternative?' '
Others have followed the example of Trump, who was able to win in 2016 by making broad promises that connected with voters while disregarding political structures of Washington policymaking, such as detailing how he would pay for it, said Michael Strain, an economist at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute.
'These policies are so large and so different from what we've seen that it's hard to come up with a good estimate of how much they would cost and how disruptive they would be,' Strain said of the Democratic proposals. 'That creates political space for the candidates to argue the best-case scenario.'

LAS VEGAS "" The Democratic presidential candidates staged their toughest and noisiest debate of the campaign Wednesday night, firing at one another with an intensity that underscored a growing sense that their nomination contest has entered what could be a decisive moment.
The race has moved swiftly since Iowa and New Hampshire, with national polls now showing Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the lead and Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, rising at the expense of others who have been fighting to become a center-left alternative to Sanders.
Everything that was on display Wednesday night "" as well as everyone on the stage "" showed the tension that now exists and the sense of urgency that time is running out on some of them. Sanders's rise has raised fears that, if he were the nominee, his brand of democratic socialism could doom the party to defeat against President Trump, along with many candidates for House and Senate.
One measure of how rapidly things are changing is this: In barely a week, the question has shifted from whether Sanders has a ceiling, based on the fact that he managed just a quarter of the vote in both Iowa and New Hampshire, to whether he can be stopped. The answer to that question could be known as early as Super Tuesday, less than two weeks away.
Some Democrats see Bloomberg as the one candidate could sell better in a general election, and there have been suggestions that the time is coming for the party to coalesce around him. But nobody on the stage Wednesday night showed any willingness to give the former mayor any quarter.
No debate in this campaign began with more at stake "" and with more expectations that it could mark an important shift in the race. Bloomberg's presence on the stage was one big reason. But so, too, was the growing reality that Sanders built up significant momentum in the first two contests and is applying it to future contests in ways that could make him ever more difficult to stop.
Ahead of the debate, a dual sensibility permeated conversation among Democratic Party strategists. One, that only Bloomberg has the resources to compete as broadly on Super Tuesday and beyond as Sanders. Two, that all the other candidates competing to become the alternative to Sanders and who have been running for the past year were not willing to concede anything to a candidate who hasn't been on any of the first four ballots.
Bloomberg supporters have not hidden their belief that only he has the potential to stop Sanders and that, in a general election, he has the resources and the positioning to defeat Trump. As the debate showed, the other candidates see him right now as an intruder of uncertain Democratic Party lineage (much like Trump with the Republicans in 2016) and resent the unprecedented amounts of his own money he has poured into the campaign.
Those ingredients are likely to combine to boost Sanders, as many Democrats predicted on the night he narrowly won New Hampshire. With Sanders increasingly consolidating the left wing of the party and the non-Sanders supporters split among others in the field, the senator from Vermont has positioned himself to gain an advantage in pledged delegates over the next 40 days of competition.
Bloomberg, the newest candidate on the stage, came in for the harshest attacks, an unruly welcome to someone who has faced no serious scrutiny since announcing his candidacy. He often struggled to parry them effectively, particularly when challenged on his record on stop-and-frisk as mayor and when called on to release women who had signed nondisclosure agreements over workplace treatment at his company. 
But the attacks weren't limited to the billionaire former mayor. At one point or another, nearly everyone on the stage drew criticism from someone else. Sanders was criticized as too polarizing and for offering health-care and other proposals without a plan to pay for them.
The debate started with an explosion of attacks and rarely slowed down, with candidates vying to get into the fray and talking over one another so loudly at times that the moderators struggled to keep order. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, their candidacies facing fresh challenges, sparred with one another. Former vice president Joe Biden went after Bloomberg and Sanders. 
No one was more aggressive than Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who was nearly invisible at the New Hampshire debate two weeks ago and came to regret it. With her candidacy in jeopardy, she was relentless in attacks on Bloomberg's record. 
'Democrats are not going to win if we have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax returns, of harassing women, and of supporting racist policies like redlining and stop-and-frisk,' Warren said in the opening minutes of the debate. 'Look, I'll support whoever the Democratic nominee is. But understand this: Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another.'
Bloomberg's presence on the stage added a new dynamic to a group of candidates who have gotten used to debating one another and often have avoided the kind of direct clashes that peppered the debate Wednesday night.
Bloomberg has focused his efforts on contests starting in March, while skipping the first four events that have reshaped the race. His spending and the results from Iowa and New Hampshire have helped him rise in national polls, a development that has triggered alarms and considerable resentment from the other candidates.
The pummeling of Bloomberg was expected, and the big question was how he would respond. At times, he fired back at his critics. At other times, he seemed to avoid jumping in when he came under fire.
Buttigieg warned Democrats that nominating either Bloomberg or Sanders would put the party at risk. 'We shouldn't have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out,' he said.
On the issue of stop-and-frisk, Bloomberg repeated his pre-campaign apology for the policies he pursued as mayor. But when he tried to explain why he had sought to change the policy, Biden slammed him, claiming that it was only because of the intervention of the Obama administration and not because of Bloomberg's initiative.
During the debate, Bloomberg was attacked for operating a workplace hostile to women, for calling the Affordable Care Act a 'disgrace,' for failing so far to release his tax returns "" he said he is working on them "" and for having supported then-President George W. Bush in 2004.
Some of the most pointed exchanges, however, were between Klobuchar and Buttigieg. Their antagonism is not new, but the stakes have been raised by the tests they face in Nevada and South Carolina in proving they can appeal to a far more diverse electorate than in Iowa and New Hampshire.
The primary-season calendar is now a friend to Sanders. In past years, there has sometimes been more than a week between last of the early-state primaries and caucuses and Super Tuesday. This year, Super Tuesday follows South Carolina by three days. 
Other than Sanders or Bloomberg, no candidate has sufficient money to make a real dent in the Super Tuesday states, though some have worked to put organizations into place. 
The question of whether Sanders can be stopped and who might be able to do that might be getting ahead of the story, but the final moments of the debate showed how much this is at the center of the campaign.
The candidates were asked whether the person with the most pledged delegates, even if not a majority, should be rewarded with a first-ballot victory at the national convention or should the convention decide at that moment what to do. Everyone but Sanders said the convention should be allowed to work its will. Sanders stood alone on the other side. 
That is what awaits the Democrats in the coming months.

Klobuchar, Steyer also had winning moments on the debate stage
The Democratic presidential primary entered a new phase Friday night, with the Iowa results finally all in and the candidates debating in New Hampshire ahead of Tuesday's primary.
Below, some winners and losers:
Winners

Bernie Sanders: Sanders weathered early attacks on his electability "" partially because the other candidates didn't completely commit to the attack "" and proceeded to have a mostly easy debate. He's a candidate who is often criticized for saying the same things over and over again, but he brought something new Friday night and gave some passionate responses that may resonate.
An answer in which he bore down on President Trump seemed to play particularly well. He said Trump had set a precedent in which 'you're going to have presidents who say, 'Hey, governor, you want highway money, you better support me. Well, you're not going to get it because I am the president. I can do anything I want. Hey, Congress, you want to investigate me? Don't be ridiculous. Who cares about the Congress? Who cares about the separation of powers? Who cares about the Constitution? . . . The president of the United States? I have all of the power, and I'm able to intimidate members of my own party.' ' Sanders added of Senate Republicans: 'They knew that Donald Trump is a cheat, but they didn't have the guts.'
Mostly, though, the night lacked a sustained or powerful line of attack on Sanders who, after all, is leading most of the polls in New Hampshire. Pete Buttigieg took more incoming on Friday.

Amy Klobuchar: The senator from Minnesota has been solid at debates, and Friday was one of her best "" mostly because she landed some punches on her top opponent, Buttigieg. She began by noting that he unequivocally supported Medicare-for-all in a 2018 tweet even though he doesn't anymore (Buttigieg responded that he had been 'consistent' on the issue but unfortunately wasn't pressed to explain). And then she had one of the strongest moments of the night when she gave plaudits to Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah) for casting tough votes to remove Trump. She was also the first to praise Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, whom Trump removed from the White House on Friday over his impeachment testimony.
Klobuchar then pivoted to another potent attack on Buttigieg for his statement that the impeachment trial exhausted him. 'It is much harder to lead and much harder to take those difficult positions,' she said, 'because I think this going after every single thing that people do, because it's popular to say and makes you look like a cool newcomer "" I just, I don't think that's what people want right now. We have a newcomer in the White House. And look where it got us.' Yikes. Klobuchar has had good debates before, though, and she still finished fifth in Iowa. She needs to do quite a bit better in New Hampshire. She clearly thinks her path goes through Buttigieg. We'll see.

Tom Steyer's warning: Steyer is easy to caricature as a candidate, and he often seems too eager to get into the mix. But early in Friday's debate, he made arguments that the Democrats would do well to heed: that they need to prosecute the economic case against Trump. 'If you look at what Mr. Trump is saying, he's saying those words: 'It's the economy, stupid,' ' Steyer said. 'I trust every one of these people a million times more [than Trump]. But we're going to have to take Mr. Trump down on the economy because if you listen to him, he's crowing about it every single day. And he's going to beat us unless we can take down on the economy, stupid.' Trump's numbers are indeed on the rise. Democrats, though, haven't figured out what their economic rebuttal to him is "" including Friday night.
Losers

Pete Buttigieg: Buttigieg got a treatment Friday night that he simply hasn't gotten before. The ever-prepared candidate may not have had any disastrous moments, but the Klobuchar attack wasn't the only one that might give some voters pause. He noted that drug arrests in South Bend, Ind., where he served as mayor, were below the national average, but then the moderator noted that they actually went up on his watch. Buttigieg responded by talking about systemic racism. Elizabeth Warren was asked whether his response was sufficient and said bluntly, 'No.' Steyer said he was 'worried about Mayor Pete' as the nominee. Plenty of candidates pointed in the same direction: that Buttigieg just isn't ready and is too big a risk. The drug arrests question also recalled Buttigieg's main liability as a candidate: his lack of support from African Americans.
One strong moment for Buttigieg, though, came when he was asked whether there was a danger in nominating Joe Biden given Republicans are investigating his son, Hunter Biden. 'No, we're not going to let them change the subject,' Buttigieg said. 'This is not about Hunter Biden or Vice President Biden or anybody. This is about an abuse of power by the president.' Nothing that happened Friday was perhaps crippling for Buttigieg, but his performance wasn't as confidence-inspiring as past ones, and it reinforced some of his liabilities.

Joe Biden: Rarely do you see a candidate begin a debate by waving the white flag, but that's kind of what Biden did on Friday. At the start of the debate, Biden acknowledged he took 'a hit in Iowa, and I'll probably take a hit here. Traditionally, Bernie won by 20 points last time.' Okay, maybe that's some expectation-setting, but usually you see that on the trail rather than in a high-profile debate in front of a bunch of would-be voters.
As the debate wore on, Biden didn't really do much to suggest his prediction was wrong. He rebutted an answer about the politics of the past by saying, 'The politics of the past, I think, are not all that bad.' He proceeded to try to rescue the point by noting significant legislation he had participated in. Then Buttigieg shot back just as quickly, 'Those achievements were phenomenally important because they met the moment, but now we have to meet this moment, and this moment is different.' At another particularly puzzling moment, Biden predicted Congress would codify Roe v. Wade if the Supreme Court overturned it, which . . . seems pretty optimistic given the politics of abortion. 
Biden tries really hard to emphasize that the past shows what can be done in the future, but you wonder how many people are buying it. Mostly, though, there was nothing Friday night to suggest Biden would arrest his backward momentum "" in New Hampshire or anywhere else.
In the middle

Elizabeth Warren: She was mostly a spectator early on "" which isn't ideal if you are the third-place candidate in Iowa. But she had some moments as the debate wore on. Particularly strong were her comments on race, in which she implored her party to focus on black voters more frequently "" even when they weren't seeking their votes. 
'Year after year after year, election after election after election, Democrats go to people in the black community and say, 'Boy, we really care about these issues. Racism is terrible. We all want to do something,' ' she said. 'And then somehow the problem just seems to keep getting worse. Well, I think it's time we have real concrete plans that are going to make a difference in people's lives.' She used the moment to argue that her wealth tax would help black people close the economic gap.

Destruction disrupts utilities and roads; some polling sites relocated

NASHVILLE - Kayela Sharrett spent Monday evening celebrating her mother's birthday with family, then went home and watched movies before going to bed.
It was a little past midnight when phones rang out urgently and sirens blared. The eerie silence that followed turned to howling wind and the sound of debris slamming into buildings.
""I ran into the hallway bathroom, screaming - trying to get everyone to wake up,"" Sharrett said. ""No one came.""
An EF-3 tornado with winds up to 165 mph tore across the Nashville area early Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. At least 24 people died in four counties because of the storms, some of them children, according to Gov. Bill Lee (R) and county officials. Dozens more were missing.
By midday, it became clear that the storms were the deadliest in Tennessee since at least 2011. Lee declared a state of emergency as hundreds of thousands of residents grappled with no power, disrupted gas and water lines and impassable roads.
At a speech before the National Association of Counties, President Trump said he will visit the area Friday.
""Our hearts are full of sorrow for the lives that were lost,"" Trump said. ""It's a vicious thing, those tornadoes. I've seen many of them during a three-year period. If you're in their path, bad things happen. Really bad things happen.""
Once the tornado passed, Sharrett's brother emerged from a bedroom. At the other end of the hall, their parents were trapped in another bedroom.
They broke through the door to find their parents with ""the ceiling on top of them and plywood literally right in between them and a tree right at my mom's face,"" Sharrett said. But they are alive with minor injuries.
The family and Sharrett's dogs descended from the rubble of what used to be her home, then navigated what seemed like a jungle of power lines to reach the street. The view from her demolished back deck revealed similar devastation west, toward downtown Nashville, and east, across the Cumberland River.
The walls of some homes were partially intact, but without roofs. Pink fiberglass cushioned footfalls on floors strewn with bricks and boards.
Cordoned by tangles of wires and toppled trees that totaled every car in sight, the cul-de-sac Sharrett's house sits on is an utter ruin.
Less than a mile away, you'd hardly know anything happened, as a steady stream of Super Tuesday voters moved in and out of the Rosebank Elementary School polling site. Outside, the sounds of helicopters, chain saws and sirens were the only clue that something was wrong. It was a sunny, 63-degree afternoon.
Officials pleaded for residents to stay off the roads when possible. ""Of course we want people to exercise caution in places like downtown Nashville, but we also want people to exercise their rights and get out and vote,"" Lee said.
Jeff Roberts, the election administrator for Davidson County, said that as many as 15 polling sites throughout the county were relocated and that others without power received generators. Election workers were also impacted.
""Some of our poll officials are trapped in their homes or can't get out of their driveways,"" Roberts told The Washington Post early Tuesday. ""We're trying to create alternate sites where precincts are inaccessible to let people vote.""
The two Davidson County election commission offices served as ""super sites,"" where anyone from the affected counties could vote.
""East Nashville isn't letting a tornado stop us from participating in our democracy,"" Lisa Estrada, a Nashville resident, tweeted from her polling station. ""What's your excuse?""
Justine Arreche, 32, went to Rosebank on Tuesday morning to vote for Bernie Sanders. Still shaken but mostly unaffected by the tornado, she worried that the storms would harm Sanders's performance in Tennessee.
Arreche said she was home alone when the storms hit. ""There's nothing like crying in your half-bath, begging the dog to come in with you,"" she said.
A tornado warning was issued for Nashville at 12:35 a.m. But by that point, the tornado had probably already touched down just northwest of the airport on the west side of the city. One minute after the warning was issued, Doppler radar confirmed a destructive tornado, with debris lofted into the air, just east of the airport, directly over the state prison near the Cumberland River.
""TAKE COVER NOW!"" the NWS tweeted. ""THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS STORM!!!!""

The destruction stretched for 50 miles across four counties. At least 48 buildings collapsed in Nashville, according to Fire Chief William Swann. Officials said gas leaks were ""a major concern"" in the tornado's wake, as were downed power lines.
Basement East, an iconic music venue in Nashville, was nearly flattened. One surviving wall had a red-white-and-blue ""I believe in Nashville"" mural painted on it.
For Arreche, the sight of beloved neighborhoods and establishments destroyed has been traumatic. The mood in East Nashville is mournful. The Gold Club Electric, where Arreche got her most recent tattoo, was leveled.
""Five Points is dust,"" Arreche said, referring to the neighborhood's commercial and cultural heart. ""I think everybody in East Nashville is feeling that. . . . It's very sad to see people who work hard at their craft lose everything.""
About 20 miles east of Nashville, police in Mount Juliet said there were ""multiple homes damaged and multiple injuries.""
""Our community has been impacted significantly,"" Mount Juliet police said. ""We continue to search for injured. Stay home if you can. Watch for downed power lines.""
In North Nashville, people surveyed the damage with flashlights before sunrise. Robert Stockton and Ricky Howard flagged down passing vehicles with a flashlight to ask for a ride. The men had been sheltering in Stockton's new Nissan Armada as the tornado passed nearby. Howard said houses, trees and power lines fell all around them as the wind violently shook the SUV.
""I could feel my car shaking,"" Stockton said, ""and then the electric thing just fell and busted my windows and fell on my car. . . . And every house around there collapsed.""
In Germantown, cars that were parked on the side of the street the night before had been blown to the middle of the road. The minor league baseball club's iconic guitar-shaped scoreboard was damaged in high winds.
James Duncan, 27, and his girlfriend took shelter in their bathroom during the tornado.
""You could hear the wind howling and get louder and louder. It started sounding like a train,"" the 27-year-old told The Post. Duncan peeked out from the window of his girlfriend's Germantown apartment and saw ""just a wall of black.""
When they stepped out into the night, it ""looked like a war zone,"" he said. Glass was everywhere. Smaller buildings looked as if they went through a paper shredder. The roof of the apartment complex across the block was shorn away.
""It looked like Godzilla took a chomp across the top,"" he said.
They smelled gas and heard water rushing from broken pipes. They were being evacuated from their building.
He, with his girlfriend and her cat, Luna, walked for a mile through debris, dodging power lines, until they reached an area clear enough for friends to pick them up.
""It was chaos,"" Duncan said. ""It felt like we were in a bad dream.""

MILWAUKEE "" Several minutes into a community meeting at which a panel of 2020 Democratic National Convention organizers spoke to African American voters, there was a sweeping realization that few in the audience, if anyone, would attend the exclusive four-day party happening in their city in July.
'None of us are really invited,' said Nyesha Stone, a 23-year-old community journalist who led the discussion. 
'You can be,' said Jorge Neri, the national convention committee's director of public engagement. 'You should get involved in your local party. You should run for delegate, because there need to be more folks like us in those slots.'
Neri said some party discussions will be open to the public, and other organizers plugged the convention's paid internship program and volunteer opportunities, along with events happening throughout the city that week that are open to all. 
'Don't undervalue what a watch party would be like that week,' said Liz Gilbert, president of the Milwaukee 2020 Host Committee, the nonpolitical group tasked with organizing the convention. 'There's going to be a lot of excitement on TV, and people want to come together as a community and watch that. And you might not be inside . . . but you're really close.'
Organizers are hopeful the convention "" especially its estimated $200 million economic impact on the region "" will improve the Democratic Party's relationship with Wisconsin voters, not further strain it, and that many of the thousands of volunteers recruited to help with the four-day event can then be mobilized to help the nominee get elected. 

In 2016, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) won 71 of 72 Wisconsin counties in the Democratic primary, and the nominee, Hillary Clinton, chose not to campaign in the state during the general election. Donald Trump won the state that November, flipping 22 mostly rural Wisconsin counties that had previously voted for President Barack Obama. The turnout rate for black voters, most of whom live in Milwaukee County, fell nearly 19 percentage points between the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections.
It was the first time since 1984 that Wisconsin sided with a Republican for president, shocking Clinton and forcing party leaders to refocus on the state, a path that ultimately led to the convention. 
'When you look at the maps and the paths to victory, it goes right through Wisconsin,' said Joe Solmonese, the chief executive of the convention. 'The convention has the potential to both generate a great deal of goodwill but also to serve as a critically important organizing principle going into the fall "" but neither of those will be the case if we don't do this work here in a respectful manner.' 
The last two elections have not gone well for Democrats in convention states. In 2016, after the Philadelphia convention, Pennsylvania went for Trump, the first time since 1988 it had been won by a Republican. In 2012, the convention was held in Charlotte; Democrats would lose North Carolina that year after winning it in 2008. 
That year, Obama was supposed to give his acceptance speech at a stadium that could hold not just delegates and party officials but also convention volunteers and members of the public. A potential storm forced the speech indoors, and thousands were promptly disinvited "" upsetting many and chilling enthusiasm.
Wisconsin Democrats say they see great potential for the convention but are well aware of the challenges. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.), a host committee co-chair who represents Milwaukee, said she told DNC Chairman Tom Perez not to 'even think about coming to Milwaukee' unless he had 'a real strategy for engaging the entire community and availing yourself of the most diverse district in the entire state.'

But how can organizers make a city of more than a half-million people feel included in a celebration that is designed to be exclusive? Host committee organizers have visited churches on Sundays, held information sessions for small business owners, volunteered at Milwaukee Public Schools and elsewhere in the city, organized community discussions about addressing economic disparities, and said 'yes' to as many invitations as possible, including the one from Stone to speak at a community meeting.
'We wanted to . . . really make sure this convention is not just about four days next summer inside of an arena, but that it's a year-long experience that engages people in every neighborhood,' Gilbert said. 
The host committee staff is much larger than in years past. Most are women or nonwhite or both, and they are led by Gilbert, who at 30 is the youngest person ever to hold the position for a Democratic convention. Angela Lang, who organizes in predominantly black neighborhoods and has been skeptical that the convention will be inclusive, credits Gilbert for reaching out, arranging a private meeting and saying, I don't want to screw this up, so help me, tell me what to do. 
'Tell us what we don't know' is a common refrain for Gilbert, who grew up in Florida, studied elementary education at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and has worked on two previous Democratic conventions. Another line she often uses when residents unleash their frustrations: 'I hear you.'
In addition to all of the things that make Milwaukee an appealing place for outsiders to visit, it is also a city that has long struggled with extreme economic inequality, poverty, segregation, underperforming public schools, police brutality and mass incarceration. 
When Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett (D) "" the other host committee co-chair and a four-term mayor who is running for reelection in April "" talks about the upcoming convention, he nearly always couples his boosterism of his city with an acknowledgment of its serious problems. 
'We know that there are poverty struggles in this city, we know that there are race struggles, we know that there are injustice struggles in this city,' Barrett said at a news conference. 'And we want to do everything we can to have more partners to address these issues. And so we're not going to shy away from the challenges that we have in this city, and we're going to embrace the advances we've made.'

To make the convention 'intentionally inclusive,' the host committee plans to reimburse some volunteers for lost wages, transportation and other expenses to expand the number who can afford to participate. Instead of having one staff member tasked with diversity and inclusion, as had been the norm, the Milwaukee host committee has nine.
The committee is also actively trying to connect with small business owners who might not think they would qualify as vendors. Lafayette Crump of the host committee said the formal events he organizes tend to attract business owners 'who know that they should be networking, who know that they should be selling themselves.' 
'But it's really important to us that those aren't the only businesses that we're reaching,' he said.
In the most impoverished parts of Milwaukee, residents have long been frustrated to see continual investment and development downtown and in the city's hip neighborhoods while their streets remain pockmarked with potholes. 
At the community meeting, resident Donna Aabidah asked convention organizers if they plan to clean up the entire city "" 'not just the cute areas' "" or if they just hope delegates won't venture down certain streets. 
Neri answered that convention officials are 'not here to solve all of Milwaukee's problems,' but that they can flag them to city leaders. 
'We want to make sure that when we leave, we leave Milwaukee better than we found it,' Neri said. 'We want to make sure that folks feel that they've been engaged, that they've been listened to, and that the Democratic Party is here for them.'
It's the sort of answer that Aabidah says she often hears, and she has little faith that this time things will be different. 
The sentiment is shared by Myron Edwards, who said he is frustrated that Democrats are not doing enough to combat mass incarceration, especially in the Milwaukee area. 
'People in Milwaukee are tired, and we don't have any solutions coming from leaders,' said Edwards, a local activist who once considered himself a Democrat but doesn't know where he now stands. 'And to have these people come here who don't know about Milwaukee . . . I really pray to God that they talk about our situation here, because it's ridiculous.'
Milwaukee has spent nearly $30 million on settlements related to police brutality since 1958. In August 2016, a Milwaukee police officer shot and killed 23-year-old Sylville K. Smith, prompting violent unrest in the Sherman Park neighborhood. In July, city police will help guard the convention "" along with several other law enforcement agencies "" providing a barrier between the city and the convention.

On a recent morning at Coffee Makes You Black, a popular restaurant and community gathering place, mentions of the convention prompted shrugs. Donald Scott, 66, said he doesn't believe the hype that the convention will dramatically impact the city in ways that continue long after the delegates have gone home. 
'I don't think people realize how transient it is,' said Scott, an Army veteran and semiretired garage door repairman and carpenter who describes himself as politically independent. 'It's not like a big factory coming in, or some major capital investment.' 
Sitting nearby were two entrepreneurs who have attended events organized by the host committee. Hyacinth Nembhardt, 39, said organizers encouraged her to become registered as a diverse supplier, a step that will benefit her long after the convention ends. 
'It really forced me to grow my business up a little bit and take that extra step to get registered,' said Nembhardt, who owns Concoctions, a frozen blended drink company.
Sitting close to the door was Anthony Houston, a Democrat who said he has heard the convention will 'put the city on the map,' although he doesn't know what exactly it will mean for him. About two years ago, the foundry where he had worked for 17 years as a union member was bought out; he lost his job. Since then, he has been unable to find steady employment and makes ends meet by driving for Uber. He has thought about going back to school to learn a new trade. 
The convention could bring him a short-term burst of business.
'It could be a lot of revenue,' he said. 'But it's only a week.'

Move by Va. former governor, DNC chair could show establishment support
The campaign of former vice president Joe Biden is making plans to recast him as the clear favorite of party leaders after his expected win Saturday in South Carolina, hoping to create momentum that will allow him to outperform moderate rivals on Super Tuesday and position him as the only viable alternative to Sen. Bernie Sanders. 
A major focus of the effort is securing endorsements from prominent Democratic figures before Tuesday, when 14 states cast their primary votes. Former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe has told associates he may endorse Biden on Sunday if Biden can pull off a strong first-place finish Saturday, according to a person familiar with McAuliffe's thinking. 
McAuliffe would join Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and former defense secretary and California congressman Leon Panetta. Both announced their support of Biden on Friday, hoping to give him a boost since Virginia and California both hold primaries March 3, also called Super Tuesday.
Their endorsements came shortly after that of Rep. James E. Clyburn, the most powerful Democrat in South Carolina, who announced Wednesday he was backing Biden. A person familiar with the Biden campaign's thinking said officials expect to see a stream of endorsements if Biden performs well in South Carolina.
The campaign's hope is to create the clear sense for voters that Biden is the consensus alternative among party leaders to Sanders (I-Vt.), a democratic socialist who some party leaders believe would have a narrower electoral college path against President Trump, potentially putting the Democratic House majority at risk and making it harder to recapture the Senate. 
""We're at an inflection point in this race and, as Joe Biden has said, he's not a socialist or a plutocrat - he's a Democrat,"" said Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman. ""The vice president's in very good company in that respect, and the stakes of beating Donald Trump in crucial battleground states are drawing them off the sidelines.""
A second Biden adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the campaign hopes the South Carolina result will mark a clear pivot in the race.
""We anticipate and hope to see momentum coming out of South Carolina, not just because we win, which we hope we will, but because we've put a damper on Bernie's momentum,"" that person said. ""No other candidate has shown an ability to put a stop on his momentum.""
There is little evidence that voters take their cues from the preferences of party elders. Rather, the Biden campaign's goal is to generate a sense of momentum and end a stretch of the campaign that has seen Sanders take a clear lead in the nomination fight, winning or coming close in the first three contests, while the party's centrists have been unable to rally around a single alternative.
Even if Biden prevails in South Carolina, however, he probably would struggle to catch up to Sanders. The senator from Vermont is polling strongly in many Super Tuesday states, including the big prize of California, forcing any would-be competitor to play catch-up. 
At a recent retreat for Senate Democrats in Baltimore, one participant described the mood as ""like a funeral"" because of concerns that Sanders is headed to the nomination. That person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions, said the broad expectation was that Biden would try to cast himself as the only person who could stop Trump's reelection if he wins big on Saturday. 
The other Democratic candidates are also preparing strategies to frame the South Carolina results, given the stakes the following Tuesday, when 34 percent of the party's convention delegates will be awarded. 
Sanders's campaign released a memo Friday describing him as ""by far - the candidate who is best positioned to defeat Donald Trump in the general election."" The memo appeared aimed at making the case that even if Sanders does not win Saturday, he remains the Democrats' best choice.
Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, whose steady rise in public polls has stalled since a disappointing debate performance in Nevada, said in an interview with MSNBC that he is committed to staying in the race ""as long as I have a chance."" 
""Yeah, I'm running a race, and I'm behind with one lap to go. What, am I going to quit? No, you run harder,"" Bloomberg said. 
Former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have been boosted by significant recent television advertising investments on their behalf by supportive super PACs, which can take unlimited donations but do not coordinate directly with the campaigns. A separate group backing Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) is spending money in key states such as Colorado. 
The Biden campaign has bought $2.2 million in broadcast and digital advertising across the Super Tuesday states, according to the campaign's data. The tracking firm Advertising Analytics reports that overall, Democrats have spent $247 million in advertising in the Super Tuesday states, driven by a massive investment by Bloomberg. 
After leading national polls for a year, Biden notched deeply disappointing performances in the first two contests, finishing fourth in Iowa and fifth in New Hampshire.
But after the Clyburn endorsement and a second-place finish in Nevada, Biden is now favored to win South Carolina, according to recent polls, although the size of his expected victory remains uncertain. His margin of victory will be a factor in McAuliffe's decision, said the person familiar with his thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. 
A Biden campaign spokesman declined to comment on McAuliffe, while a McAuliffe spokesman said the former governor ""has not made a decision on an endorsement.""
McAuliffe is an influential figure among Democratic leaders, and in some ways, he embodies the party establishment. McAuliffe chaired the Democratic National Committee and has close ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, holding top positions with their presidential campaigns. He also contemplated a presidential run himself this year.
He has been neutral in the race so far, although he held a fundraiser in November for Biden at his home in McLean. About 115 guests stood around McAuliffe's pool as the former governor described how Biden had helped Virginia as vice president, securing grants for the state and fighting to clean the Shenandoah River. 
""We've got to get America back to where people get along, where we have alliances around the world and everybody loves the United States of America,"" McAuliffe said, adding that Trump's ""insanity"" had led the country ""off the rails."" 
McAuliffe's wife, Dorothy, is backing Biden and is kicking off a get-out-the-vote event Saturday in Alexandria. At the November fundraiser she called Biden ""a great man,"" a ""great public servant"" and the Democrat who has ""the best chance of beating Donald Trump.""
Biden is scheduled to attend a rally at Booker T. Washington High School in Norfolk on Sunday evening, which could provide a platform for a McAuliffe announcement.

Hundreds of campaign staffers to be rehired for effort to unseat Trump
Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg has decided to form an independent expenditure campaign that will absorb hundreds of his presidential campaign staffers in six swing states to work to elect the Democratic nominee this fall.
The group, with a name that is still undisclosed because its trademark application is in process, would also be a vehicle for Bloomberg to spend money on advertising to attack President Trump and support the Democratic nominee, according to a person familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal internal deliberations. 
The moves come as Bloomberg has continued to taunt Trump on social media, releasing a video Thursday on Twitter that cut together a number of clips in a way meant to mock Trump's claims that he would win the White House, hold the Senate and take back the U.S. House. 
""We are not going anywhere. We will haunt your dreams. We are in your head,"" the video declares in spliced-together clips from movies, television shows and music videos. ""Starting today, and every day after that, every morning, every night, we will be here watching you, always watching, making sure everyone knows what a disaster you are.""
The new group, operating with the same potentially limitless bankroll that funded Bloomberg's campaign, could play a major role in shaping the race this fall.
Bloomberg, who is worth more than $50 billion, also has not ruled out using the group to spend money to support former vice president Joe Biden during his primary fight against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Bloomberg dropped out of the race Wednesday. 
""I've always believed that defeating Donald Trump starts with uniting behind the candidate with the best shot to do it,"" Bloomberg said Wednesday after his disappointing showing in the Super Tuesday primaries. ""After yesterday's vote, it is clear that candidate is my friend and a great American, Joe Biden.""
The promise of help has been welcomed by Biden, but advisers to Sanders have said they do not want any general-election assistance from Bloomberg if their candidate wins the nomination. 
Bloomberg's advisers have identified Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Florida and North Carolina as the six states that will decide the electoral college winner this year. Staffers in each of those states have signed contracts through November to work on the effort. 
The new group also could serve as a vehicle for Bloomberg to support Democratic candidates for the House and Senate. In 2018, Bloomberg gave $20 million to Senate Majority PAC to support Democratic senatorial candidates. A separate group he founded, Independence USA, spent $38 million to help Democrats retake the U.S. House. 
Some of the seats Democrats won in 2018 will have to be defended in 2020 in states, such as Pennsylvania and Michigan, where Bloomberg plans to have organizing teams through the fall. Democrats also see Senate pickup opportunities in Arizona and North Carolina, while Sen. Gary Peters (D) faces a potentially competitive reelection campaign in Michigan.
The Bloomberg operation could provide a major backstop to efforts by the Democratic National Committee and the remaining presidential campaigns, which have dramatically trailed the Republican National Committee and the Trump reelection campaign in fundraising as well as in preparing for a general election.
The Trump campaign reported $93 million in cash on hand at the end of January vs. $7 million reported by Biden and $17 million reported by Sanders.
Bloomberg also will continue to fund Hawkfish, a data effort to support Democratic campaigns. That operation is structured as a separate for-profit campaign vendor to Bloomberg's campaign, the person familiar with the discussions said, so there is no need to reorganize its structure to allow it to work with the new group.
 Hawkfish has signed a long-term lease in the same building in New York's Times Square that houses Bloomberg's presidential campaign. The campaign, by contrast, plans to wind down its lease at the property. 
The Bloomberg campaign offices and staffs that remain in other states - he has 12 offices open in Ohio, for example - will be closed in the coming weeks. Staffers will be offered the chance to apply to do field work in the targeted general-election states.
Because of campaign finance rules, Bloomberg's aides have concluded that they cannot simply tell campaign employees to work directly for Biden. ""The folks in those states have been told that they can apply for spots in the battleground,"" said the person familiar with the plans.
 At its peak, Bloomberg's campaign boasted a staff of more than 2,100, including about 1,800 in state offices away from his New York headquarters. Since announcing his campaign in late November, he spent $558 million on advertising, according to the ad tracking firm Advertising Analytics.
""Today I am clear-eyed about our ultimate objective, and that is victory in November,"" Bloomberg said Wednesday during a speech in New York City. ""I will not be our party's nominee, but I will not walk away from the most important political fight of my life.""

MANCHESTER, N.H. "" Sen. Elizabeth Warren started her campaign with a big gamble: She'd build a huge organization in Iowa that would power her to victory there, propelling her to a win in New Hampshire and giving her unstoppable momentum to the Democratic nomination. 
Disappointing finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire now suggest the gamble has failed. And the rapidly shifting landscape has left the reeling Warren campaign with one more last-ditch bet: that in a party increasingly divided between democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders and centrists like Pete Buttigieg, she can pitch herself as the one person to bring the sides together. 
'We might be headed for another one of those long primary fights that last for months,' Warren (D-Mass.) said Tuesday at her election-night party. 'We have to figure out as Democrats whether it will be a long, bitter rehash of the same old divides in our party, or whether we can find another way.'
The campaign and its allies have signaled it is seeking to retool in several ways beyond the strengthened unity pitch: renewing outreach to minority voters, especially women; signaling that Warren will tell more personal stories on the stump; seeking to steadily win delegates even in states where she does not come in first; and relying on potential allies such as the Culinary Union.
But time is short and money limited, and it's not clear whether Warren, who for much of the past year seemed as good a prospect as anyone to win the Democratic nomination, can regain her momentum in the face of the rising strength of Sanders (I-Vt.), Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), with former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg waiting in the wings. 

It's a remarkable moment for a candidate who enjoyed a steady rise for much of last spring and summer, culminating in massive rallies in New York, Seattle, St. Paul, Minn., and elsewhere that gave her the veneer "" and briefly the polling "" of a front-runner. Her campaign says Warren is pushing ahead, but her finish in New Hampshire behind two Senate colleagues and a 38-year-old ex-mayor of South Bend, Ind., following a third-place finish in Iowa, narrows the path significantly. 

Warren held a call with her campaign team after Tuesday's defeat, trying to buck them up by saying, 'These moments are when we find out why we're on the fight,' according to a person familiar with the conversation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private call. She also huddled with her New Hampshire staff Tuesday evening to thank them. 
Hours before the polls closed, Warren campaign manager Roger Lau released a rare memo filled with internal data, seeking to reassure supporters and donors that Warren could remain viable. Lau argued that the Democratic race remains highly fractured with no clear front-runner on the horizon, and that Warren has a good chance of emerging from the muddle.
Even without outright victories in many of the early primary states, he contended, Warren could steadily collect delegates from second- and third-place finishes. 
Warren now heads into two contests, in Nevada and South Carolina, with little evidence that she has built momentum. She appears to be seeking an opening in both states by connecting particularly with minority female voters. 
The senator on Wednesday canceled TV ads in both states and is set to be dark there starting Monday, according to Advertising Analytics, which tracks ad buying.
For a time, Warren seemed to splitting the support of the party's liberal faction with Sanders while attracting backing from some centrists. But now Sanders has consolidated the left flank, while Buttigieg has become a favorite of the college-educated and moderate segments of the party.
That has left Warren without a sizable chunk of political turf to call her own. But supporters argue she has a chance to prove her viability with a strong performance on Super Tuesday, March 3, when more than a dozen states cast their votes and deliver the first big single-day trove of delegates.
'The big kahuna is Super Tuesday,' said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a liberal political action committee that backs Warren. 'So it's important that she enters Super Tuesday with momentum. And she'll have a friendly audience in the upcoming racially diverse states.'

But Warren has struggled to win the affections of nonwhite voters. She garnered support from just 9 percent of respondents in a Washington Post/IPSOS survey of black Democrats in January, compared with 48 percent for Biden and 20 percent for Sanders.
The poll suggested Warren has room to grow, since 20 percent said she would be their second choice and roughly the same number said they did not know enough about her to form an opinion. 
Warren's supporters say that gives her an opening. Green and others cited a performance by Warren at a forum on issues concerning black women, where Warren received by far the most enthusiastic response. But that event, sponsored by the group She the People, occurred last April, and in the ensuing 10 months there's been little indication that the burst of enthusiasm for her has translated into support. 





As the disappointing finish took shape Tuesday night, Warren's team stayed quiet about any plans to overhaul her message or operation. Several top staffers milled around a buffet during the election-night party near the Manchester airport, but they disappeared after she spoke and did not talk to reporters. 
'She's got to have a moment,' said former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe. 'You can't just talk unity "" that's not going to do it for you.'
McAuliffe said the next debate will test Warren's ability to show the toughness and grit that Democrats want in a candidate facing President Trump. Even some allies agree that Warren's last debate performance, on a New Hampshire stage, was her worst showing to date. They predicted she would do better in Nevada on Feb. 19. 
Meanwhile, small shifts have started to emerge. On Tuesday, Warren began to contrast herself more explicitly with Sanders, telling reporters she had a more pragmatic, less purist approach to governing.


Warren pointed to her vote in support of the North American Free Trade Agreement rewrite, which unions supported but environmentalists opposed. 
'We voted, for example, in different ways on the trade deal,' she said. 'Bernie said, 'Not good enough,' and I said, 'I'll take some help and fight for better.' And I think that's a difference.'
Some Warren allies suggested that her newfound willingness to contrast herself with Sanders reflected a recognition that she was more likely to poach voters who are now backing the moderate candidates than to win over Sanders loyalists.
Warren also has taken to telling more personal stories in recent days, including an account of a dispute she had with her mother over whether she should attend college. 
'One of the things that I realized is that voters have a right to know, not just the policies, but also the heart of the person they're going to pick for president of the United States,' Warren said. 'So I put out all the policies, but I also put more of my heart out.'

President Trump on Friday endorsed a tweet comparing the top Senate Democrat to Iran, the United States' longtime adversary, suggesting neither could be trusted, as Democratic leaders criticized the White House for ordering a military strike to kill a powerful Iranian commander without congressional input.
Amid a flurry of reactions from U.S. lawmakers, Trump retweeted conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza, who, in response to a headline about Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) not receiving advance notice of the military operation, wrote: 'Neither were the Iranians, and for pretty much the same reason.'
Trump made similar insinuations about Democrats' trustworthiness after the October raid that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. At that time, Trump said he didn't tell House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), a former member of the Intelligence Committee, because 'he wanted to make sure this kept secret.'
Trump ordered the U.S. drone strike that killed Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani, whom the United States regarded as a war criminal responsible for hundreds of American deaths.
Republicans and Democrats were united in calling Soleimani an enemy of the United States and a terrorist.
'This morning, Iran's master terrorist is dead,' said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in remarks on the Senate floor. 'The architect and chief engineer for the world's most active state sponsor of terrorism has been removed from the battlefield at the hand of the United States military.'
Schumer called Soleimani a 'notorious terrorist,' and added: 'No one should shed a tear over his death.'
But as Republicans celebrated what they described as Trump's decisive action, Democrats criticized the president's order to act unilaterally while expressing grave concern that this action would move the United States closer to an in trac table war with Iran. 
'No matter how good it may feel that Qasem Soleimani is no longer alive, he likely will end up being more dangerous to the United States, our troops and our allies, as a martyr than as a living, breathing military adversary,' said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.).
Trump, in brief remarks Friday afternoon about the attack, said he targeted Soleimani to 'stop a war,' not to start one.
Presidents typically inform the so-called Gang of Eight "" the House speaker and minority leader, the Senate majority and minority leaders, and the chairmen and ranking minority-party members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees "" about high-level military operations.
Top Democratic leaders in Congress received no advance notification of the strike, aides said. Pelosi spoke to Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper after the attack for about 13 minutes, said an aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak publicly.
'I'm a member of the Gang of Eight, which is typically briefed in advance of operations of this level of significance. We were not,' Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor, adding that the administration must be 'asked probing questions not from your inner and often insulated circle, but from others, particularly Congress, which forces an administration before it acts to answer very serious questions.'
It was unclear which congressional leaders were given advance notice of the strike. 
McConnell said only that he had spoken to the defense secretary and was arranging a classified briefing for all senators early next week, but he provided no details on when he first learned about the strike.
Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a Trump ally, said Friday morning on Fox News that he was 'briefed about the potential operation when I was down in Florida' and appreciated 'being brought into the orbit.'
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) posted a photo on Instagram of himself and Trump at the president's Mar-a-Lago estate late Thursday, though it was not clear whether he, too, was briefed ahead of time.
McCarthy praised the killing of Soleimani as a 'statement to those seeking to attack America.' Trump, McCarthy said, had responded appropriately to violence by Iranian-backed groups in Iraq, including an attempt to storm the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
'In a display of resolve and strength, we struck the leader of those attacking our sovereign U.S. territories,' he said. 
Most Democrats focused their ire on Trump's unilateral action that they said could propel America into another conflict in the Middle East, yet Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) directed a more personal blow at Trump. 
'The Occupant was JUST impeached for abuse of power for political gain - now he is leading us to the brink of war because he believes it will help his re-election. We are sick of endless wars. Congress has the sole authority to declare war and we must deescalate. #NoWarWithIran,' Pressley tweeted.
Many of Trump's possible Democratic opponents in the presidential election also offered stern rebukes of Trump's handling of foreign policy. 
Calling the strike against Soleimani an assassination, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted that the United States was 'on the brink of yet another war in the Middle East.' She added: 'We're here because a reckless president, his allies, and his administration have spent years pushing us here.'
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called it a 'dangerous escalation,' and former vice president Joe Biden said in a statement that Trump 'just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox.'
In New Hampshire, Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, who was an intelligence officer in Afghanistan, echoed many congressional Democrats who have wondered what the strategy is now. 'If we have learned nothing else from the Middle East, in the last 20 years, it's that taking out a bad guy is not a good idea unless you're ready for what comes next,' Buttigieg said. 
In Iowa, Sanders condemned Trump's action and emphasized his long record of opposing many U.S. military interventions abroad, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq. 
 'It gives me no pleasure to tell you at this moment we face a similar crossroads fraught with danger,' he said, adding that Trump's decision 'now puts us on the path to another war, potentially one that could be even worse than before.'

COLUMBIA, S.C. "" In a tiny office space with fold-up furniture and 'Humanity First' posters on the wall, surrounded by local television cameras and about three dozen giddy volunteers in a markedly diverse range of ages and skin tones, Dave Chappelle picked out a phone number off a list and dialed.
The comedian was doing the unglamorous grunt work of phone banking last week on behalf of businessman Andrew Yang, the underdog Democratic presidential candidate whom Chappelle has endorsed.
A woman named Melissa improbably answered the unknown number and was also improbably cheerful about the whole thing. How would she rank Yang on a scale of one to five, 'one being crazy about him and five is kind of like, let's call it 'Trump,' ' Chappelle asked.
She responded 'one' "" a big fan. 'Okay!' he said. 'My name is Dave Chappelle. I'm a world-famous comedian.' Then he became perhaps the first phone banker in history to sign off a cold call not with goodbye but 'Wu Tang.'
The phalanx of journalists filming the whole thing burst out laughing.
But Chappelle wasn't there just for laughs. He'd been making the case for Yang in South Carolina, where he hosted two stand-up comedy fundraisers in hopes of urging voters to head to the polls for Yang in the state's crucial Feb.-29 primary.
Yang's signature campaign proposal is a universal basic income, or giving an $1,000 a month 'Freedom Dividend' to every American, forever. Chappelle sees him as the one person in the race whose policies could make an immediate difference in the lives of his neighbors in Dayton, Ohio, a third of whom live in poverty.
'You give a family like that $12,000 a year, or if there's two adults in the house, $24,000, that is going to put them in striking distance of the middle class,' Chappelle told the reporters in Columbia. 'I want health care and all of those things, but what good is health care without groceries?'
Chappelle, an iconoclastic black comedian being linked with an outsider candidate, who is also one of the first Asian Americans to make a viable bid for the presidency, is the kind of perfect, and perfectly odd, brand synergy that grabs headlines. And in a crowded field with Yang polling at 4 percent nationally, he could use the help.
Chappelle's not alone in finding a candidate to love. Numerous celebrities "" Ellen DeGeneres and Jennifer Aniston (former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg), Cardi B and Ariana Grande (Sen. Bernie Sanders ), and John Legend and Chrissy Teigen (Sen. Elizabeth Warren ) "" have jumped in with the idealistic, probably futile, hope that their support could move the needle.
The race for the Democratic nomination is still unsettled and crowded, plus the Iowa caucuses were a mess, and the New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina primaries are coming up any minute. Sunday's Academy Awards will probably feature stars using their acceptance speeches as political pulpits. Presidential endorsements are an extension of that activism, which is itself an extension of the way celebrities use their social media platforms to erase the boundaries between themselves and their followers.
'What's really important about celebrities is that they help to attract an audience,' said Jamal Simmons, a Democratic strategist who worked for the campaigns of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. But, 'very few people will support a candidate because of a celebrity's endorsement.'
Perhaps the only instance in which there's empirical data that a big name made a big difference is Oprah Winfrey's endorsement of Obama in the 2008 election. A study suggests she gave him 1 million additional votes in the primaries and caucuses. The authors, economists from the University of Maryland, called it 'the Oprah effect.'
Even Oprah has her limits, though. She campaigned for Stacey Abrams in a tough Georgia gubernatorial race in 2018, which Abrams lost.
Then there are the times when celebrity endorsements go bad, such as when Clint Eastwood talked to an empty chair that was supposed to represent Obama while Eastwood was backing Mitt Romney at the 2012 Republican National Convention.
For now, Chappelle is making the most of his platform. He brought Yang onstage at his comedy show at Iowa State University in Ames two weeks before the caucuses and filmed a new campaign ad with Yang backstage. (Yang got 1 percent of the vote in Iowa as of Thursday.) 
Tickets for his two South Carolina shows "" in performing art centers holding more than 2,300 people "" were sold at $128 apiece as direct donations to Yang 2020. (The campaign wouldn't share fundraising numbers). In South Carolina, where black voters make up nearly two-thirds of the primary electorate, Chappelle appealed to African Americans by often mentioning that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had made the case for a similar form of guaranteed income in 1967, shortly before he died.
The campaign says that just by showing up, he's boosting morale and helping recruit volunteers. 
'For a guy like me to be vocal about this type of thing, it's not really my jam,' Chappelle told reporters in Columbia. Yang is the first candidate Chappelle has endorsed. 'But I've got to do my civic duty. I don't like to say I'm telling people what to do. I'm just letting them know an option that I think is incredible so that it gets more attention, shine more light on it.'
Supporters as cliques

Maybe the point isn't that a celebrity's support matters at all in the polls, but they can help you match a candidate to your personality, like an electoral Myers-Briggs or love languages quiz.
Squint, and the camps of celebrities who've formed around the Democratic candidates in this 2020 race look a lot like lunch tables in a high school cafeteria. 
Sanders, the senator from Vermont, has the band, the chorus and the orchestra, plus all the kids who smoked under the bleachers and played in garage bands. His supporters joke that his roster is so big he could throw his own music festival, 'Berncella' or 'Bernaroo.' He had Bon Iver and Vampire Weekend play rallies in Iowa and soon the Strokes will headline a New Hampshire rally. Miley Cyrus, Jack White, Kim Gordon, Danny DeVito, Jack Nicholson and Killer Mike have endorsed, along with Phish. Even Tony! Toni! Toné! is on board.
Former vice president Joe Biden has cornered the debate team and straight-A athletes. John F. Kerry practically lives on his campaign bus. Michelle Kwan is on staff as surrogate director, with support from Vivica A. Fox, Tom Hanks and George R.R. Martin. (Okay, so this analogy isn't perfect.)
The artsy radical feminists who all got into Brown seem to flock to Warren, the senator from Massachusetts: Ashley Judd, who's been stumping in New Hampshire, Scarlett Johansson, Megan Rapinoe, Amy Schumer, Shonda Rhimes and Jonathan Van Ness of 'Queer Eye.' 
Buttigieg's celebrity endorsement vibe is straight out of 'Glee,' and the earnest, high-achieving activist kids who remind you to recycle, like Mandy Moore, Ben Harper, Gwyneth Paltrow, Michael J. Fox, Ryan Murphy (who actually created 'Glee'), Kevin Costner, and, an anomaly, Sharon Stone. 
The closest thing to a celebrity endorsement Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) gets is Phill Drobnick, who coached the men's U.S. Olympic curling team to a gold medal.
Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg has the whole disgruntled teacher's lounge: Judith Sheindlin (better known as Judge Judy), Michael Douglas, Sam Waterston, Tim Gunn, Isaac Mizrahi, John Mellencamp (who voiced an ad for him) and 'Sopranos' actress Lorraine Bracco.
Yang has the kids who stopped caring about cliques and are just waiting to get out of there and take over the world, like Chappelle, Donald Glover, 'The Walking Dead's' Steven Yeun, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian and Elon Musk.
There's a danger that too much celebrity support will backfire and lead to the nominee being painted as in the pocket of the 'Hollywood liberal elite,' said GOP strategist Doug Heye, who noted that Hillary Clinton's star-studded final rallies "" Beyoncé, Bruce Springsteen, Lady Gaga "" looked like an overconfident victory lap to some voters. 
But the bigger question for Democrats in this general election is whether celebrity endorsements will make any traction at all when President Trump, who was a reality TV star, now has an infinite platform as the sitting president and all the inherent advantages of an incumbent. 'Remember, Donald Trump himself is the ultimate celebrity and sort of remains at the center of this race,' said Mark Harvey, author of 'Celebrity Influence: Politics, Persuasion, and Issue-Based Advocacy.' 'Like it or not, they're all dwarfed by him.'
The Democrats could announce a hundred more celebrity endorsements each, and, Simmons said, '[Trump] just gobbles up so much media coverage that your celebrity endorsement is maybe, like, a paragraph on A4.'
'Is this a sign?'

So if endorsing is somewhat futile, why and how do celebrities get involved?
For Mandy Moore, she saw Buttigieg speak early last year in Los Angeles and was so struck by his message of hope and unity that, she said, 'after that I wanted to do anything I could to support him and his campaign.'
What began as an introduction at an event here and there turned into campaigning in Louisiana, Iowa and Florida with Chasten, Pete's husband, which led to road trips and singalongs and a lasting friendship. Now she gets to do the second job of a surrogate, which is to show the human side of the candidate she supports.
'What always strikes me about the two of them is how dramatically their lives have changed over the course of the last year and yet how gracefully they adapted to those changes,' she says. 'They're so normal, which I know is a silly comment, but I love it.' 
Two-time Olympic figure skating medalist Kwan was always leaning toward Biden because she knew him from working in the State Department under Obama and as a surrogate on Clinton's 2016 campaign. Then she took a trip to the District just before he announced and not only met Biden's future campaign manager, Greg Schultz, by chance through a friend, but also sat next to Jill, his wife, on her plane back to Los Angeles. It was a total accident.
'So,' Kwan said. 'I kind of went, 'Is this a sign?' ' Now she is Biden's director of surrogates, a unique position that means she's both in charge of recruiting other surrogates and being one herself. And yes, there are ice-skating events. 
Sally Field has actually never met Warren, but after watching the first seven debates decided to go with her gut and pick the woman, she says, who 'has the clearest plan to address the symptoms that led to the election of Donald Trump.'
As soon as she made up her mind, her son, Sam, contacted the campaign, which put Field's tweet language into a Warren-approved endorsement graphic.
Field worried that her celebrity might make it hard to help the campaign in the way she wants "" given that Warren's message is about the working class.
'I'm a citizen and I don't want to be excluded from the process of helping just because I happen to be an actor,' Field said. 'I [said to Warren's campaign], 'Look, I can hide the fact that I'm an actor. Trust me! I look like a schlub when I go to the market.'
Why Chappelle is Yang Gang

As for Chappelle, he says he found out about Yang when he asked a friend who he liked in the first debate, and, the friend responded, ''I liked the Chinese guy.'' Chappelle thought he was joking. (Yang is Taiwanese American.)
Then months later, as Chappelle's Netflix comedy special came out, friends started sending him Yang's tweet saying that Chappelle was his favorite comedian. It so happened that that very week, a neighbor gave him a copy of Yang's book, 'The War on Normal People.' He read it and immediately asked his wife to reach out to Yang's campaign. They met up after the December debate in Los Angeles and ended up connecting over their children and their concern for the country's future. It was Chappelle's idea to do a few shows for fundraising and the campaign's idea to have him phone bank.
When Chappelle left the Yang 2020 field office in Columbia recently, he made sure to wear his brand-new blue MATH hat, one of Yang's slogans, and his answer to Trump's MAGA hats: Make America Think Harder.
Chappelle knows Yang's chances are slim, but he pointed out that 'there was a senator from Illinois one time, and people didn't think he could do it.' Given the overwhelming amount of prejudice in the country, Chappelle said, he found Yang inspiring. 'It's inspiring to see someone have the courage to do something that seems unlikely and just be like, 'why not?' And I'm a big fan of 'Why not?''
Besides, it's time for new blood, the comedian added: 'My daughter is 10. Trump is her first white president. She thinks the whites are doing a terrible job!'

Gabbard, a member of Congress since 2013 and a veteran of the Iraq War, has been a voice for her party's left on domestic issues and a critic of foreign military intervention. Gabbard, 38, was the youngest person ever elected to the Hawaii legislature before heading to the U.S. House, becoming the first Hindu woman to serve in the chamber. She backed Sen. Bernie Sanders for president in 2016 and resigned from a post with the Democratic National Committee to fully support him. She has criticized President Barack Obama for not using the term 'Islamic' in condemning terrorism and has played down special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's report of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

If you asked a casual news consumer what the big Washington story was over the past few days, there's a decent chance you would hear about a supposed feud between two Democratic presidential candidates "" Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.
That, after all, was a media obsession for days: an easy-to-understand, easy-to-argue-about story with compelling audio and video. 
Made for TV. Made for punditry. Let's all plumb the greater meaning of whether the senator from Vermont really once told the senator from Massachusetts that he didn't think a woman could be elected president. 
And while this is grounded in an important issue (ingrained sexism in American culture and politics), there were matters of greater significance going on.
There was compelling new evidence that President Trump knew everything about the effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and the 2016 election, and to push an American diplomat out of the way.
This was revealed in documents and text messages and in blockbuster interviews, first with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow and later with CNN's Anderson Cooper. It was stunning stuff, particularly in the context of Trump's impeachment and a Senate trial in which most Republican senators, according to their leadership, already have their minds made up.
'This is . . . like if Watergate burglars gave [an] interview to Walter Cronkite in Jan 1974 and detailed the Nixon criminal enterprise,' tweeted the journalist and author Eric Boehlert about Maddow's interview with Lev Parnas, the Soviet-born businessman who played a key role in the pressure campaign.
It was a much, much bigger deal than the Warren-Sanders dust-up.
But these developments were presented as roughly equal, or at least in the same general category of emphasis, on TV newscasts and Sunday talk shows, as if to say, 'Here's a couple of Washington stories about politicians fighting with each other . . . .'
A sense of proportion "" what's significant and what's trivial "" seems strangely missing.
 What truly deserves our all-out attention and outrage? What's the small stuff?
Numbed by the barrage of news, dazzled by distraction, many citizens don't seem to know anymore.
And news sources, particularly TV and social media, show little ability or desire to help. (As Pew Research in late 2018 revealed, TV is still the main way that all Americans get their news; younger people increasingly rely on social media; and newspapers are fading by the day as a news source.)
Part of the problem is that the Ukraine story is relatively complicated. The cast of characters is hard to keep track of.
Lev Parnas? Marie Yovanovitch? And now (a new name to emerge this week), Robert Hyde, who may have been illegally tracking the American ambassador?
It's unlikely that most Americans would have a clue who they are.
 If you doubt that, you ought to know that, in a 'Jeopardy!' episode aired a few days ago, three contestants were shown a photo and given a description of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.). 
A librarian, a tutor and an English professor, they all looked baffled as they failed to come up with his name.
'Even three really smart people are not paying close enough attention to the impeachment circus to recognize the face of one of its ringleaders,' was how writer Karen Townsend put it on the website Hotair.
The widespread lack of news literacy and basic civics is something that Trump depends upon. ('I love the poorly educated,' he crowed in early 2016 after winning the Nevada primary.) Or as Ohio-based columnist Connie Schultz wrote recently: 'Nothing scares Trump more than informed voters.'
The mainstream news media may not see the obligation to break through citizens' lack of knowledge. 
They may not see their role as educating, or getting across what's important but complicated in an understandable, clear way.
It's easier "" and probably more profitable "" to play to people's prejudices or lowest instincts.
'We want a conflict because we too often see politics as a sporting event,' said Walter Shapiro, who is covering his 11th presidential campaign, this time for the New Republic, and teaches a politics-and-media course at Yale.
Shapiro told me that he watched reporters in the spin room after the Democratic debate in Des Moines last week sharing video of Warren supposedly refusing to shake Sanders's hand.
'It was a nothing story,' he told me, but useful to journalists because it fit in with their preexisting story line.
Focused on personality wars, the Democratic debates (and the media generally) have looked away from the pressing, if unsexy, subject of poverty in America, as Joel Berg, CEO of Hunger Free America, noted in an email to me this week "" 'even as a third of all Americans live under or near the poverty line.' 
Will anything change next week as the impeachment trial moves forward in the Senate?
 Or will some Republican senators' apparent reluctance to consider evidence or call witnesses be depicted as just more political wrangling? Another political food fight, evidence of nothing but that catchall: partisanship.
The news media is all too predictable, doing things the same old way from campaign to campaign, from scandal to scandal.
But we exist now in a different context: With democratic norms on the brink, the public desperately needs us to do much, much better.

President Trump was acquitted Wednesday by the Republican-controlled Senate of charges that he abused the powers of his office and obstructed Congress as it probed his attempts to pressure Ukraine into political investigations "" capping a tumultuous, three-week impeachment trial that leaves his fate in the hands of voters in November.
Democrats fell far short of the two-thirds majority required to remove Trump from office, as senators voted 52 to 48 to acquit him on the abuse-of-power allegation and 53 to 47 to clear him of obstruction. 
The outcome represented a political triumph for the White House and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who successfully held together nearly the entire GOP caucus in blocking witnesses or additional evidence from the proceedings. Just one Republican, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, voted to convict the president of abuse of power.
Shortly after the twin acquittal votes, Trump tweeted that he will deliver a statement Thursday on 'our Country's VICTORY on the Impeachment Hoax!' He also tweeted a clip featuring a mock magazine cover with signs showing him staying in office far beyond the two terms permitted under the Constitution. And Brad Parscale, Trump's 2020 campaign manager, proclaimed that he had been 'totally vindicated.' 
'Throughout this wholly corrupt process, President Trump successfully advanced the interests of the United States and remained focused on the issues that matter to Americans,' White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said. 'He spent his time achieving real victories for the people of this country, and the Democrats "" once again "" have nothing to show for their fraudulent schemes.'
The third impeachment trial of a president in U.S. history concluded one of the most bitter episodes in recent memory in Washington "" marked by partisan fighting over what constitutes a fair trial, furious debates over the propriety of Trump's dealings with Ukraine and outsized pressure on a small core of Republican senators who held considerable sway in whether the trial would subpoena key witnesses from the Trump administration who had defied calls to appear before the House during its investigation.
But the vote by Romney, the party's 2012 presidential nominee, robbed the president of the unified GOP opposition against impeachment that he had enjoyed and repeatedly boasted of since the inquiry began in September. Romney is the first senator in history to vote to remove a president of his or her own party.
Romney called Trump's demand to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that he investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter a 'flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security and our fundamental values.' In a July 25 phone call with Zelensky that he has repeatedly described as 'perfect,' Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate not only the Bidens but a discredited theory that it was Ukraine rather than Russia that attempted to interfere in the 2016 election. 
'There's no question in my mind that were their names not Biden, the president would never have done what he did,' Romney said in an eight-minute speech delivered in a Senate chamber that was nearly void of his colleagues. Later, he added: 'Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.' 
Romney was the sole senator who not only defected from his own party but split his vote, choosing to acquit Trump of obstructing Congress. 
Democrats accused Republicans of emboldening an unchecked president who sought foreign influence in U.S. campaigns for his personal benefit. Republicans portrayed Democrats as a party still embittered by its loss in the 2016 presidential elections that has now decided to weaponize the constitutional impeachment process. 
'This sham process is the low point in the Senate for me,' said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), once a Trump foe who has transformed into one of the president's closest allies. 'If you think you've done the country a good service by legitimizing this impeachment process, what you have done is unleashed the partisan forces of hell.' 

The question of whether Trump should stay in office now moves from the Senate chamber to the campaign trail. Just one day prior, Trump stayed away from any mention of impeachment in Tuesday's State of the Union address, although he is almost certain to tout his acquittal at rallies and in other venues, such as Thursday's planned statement, as he campaigns for a second term.
The issue is also likely to surface in competitive Senate races, mostly as Democrats target GOP senators for aligning themselves with Trump and his conduct. But in a victory lap news conference after the votes, McConnell said the Democrats' decision to proceed with impeachment was a 'colossal political mistake.'
The majority leader noted that Trump is enjoying some of his strongest approval ratings now and added that 'as a poll watcher who's looking at polls in certain Senate races, every one of our people in tough races . . . is in better shape today than they were before the impeachment trial started.' 
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) insisted that Democrats were not motivated by politics and said 'Democrats walked out of the Senate chamber with their heads held high.'
Ripples from impeachment also may continue in the House, with Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and one of the impeachment managers, saying Wednesday that Democrats will probably subpoena former national security adviser John Bolton in the near future.
'When you have a lawless president, you have to bring that to the fore, you have to spotlight that,' Nadler told reporters. Bolton has said he would appear before the Senate if subpoenaed but has been silent on whether he would appear before the House.
Despite weeks of protests from Democrats, the Senate last week voted not to hear from additional witnesses, including Bolton, during the trial. An unpublished manuscript from the ex-White House official's forthcoming book has alleged that Trump directly tied the withholding of nearly $400 million in military assistance to Ukraine to the political investigations the president had demanded. 
The tone inside the chamber during the historic vote was solemn, as each senator took turns standing up at his or her desk and proclaiming 'guilty' or 'not guilty' to each article of impeachment. The public galleries were the most crowded they have been throughout the trial, as the backbenches on the chamber floor, reserved for members of the House who wanted to attend the trial, filled in with congressmen from both parties.
Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the lead prosecutor for House managers, sat in the first chair of their table, turned at a three-quarters position so he could swivel his head around the chamber with every senator's name called out, glancing around the room. When each of the two roll calls ended, he pivoted around to stare at the clerks and parliamentarians as they double checked the votes. 
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. read the results after each vote, proclaiming Trump not guilty of both charges. Shortly after, McConnell thanked Roberts for presiding over the proceedings with a 'clear head, steady hand and the forbearance that this rare occasion demands.' 
Trump was impeached by the House on Dec. 18, as nearly all Democrats there proclaimed that he had abused his powers and then obstructed Congress's attempts to investigate him. At the heart the case against Trump presented by the impeachment managers was the allegation that he withheld military aid and a coveted White House meeting to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. The younger Biden served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, while his father was vice president. 
Throughout the acrimonious Senate trial, the only real point of suspense "" aside from where a handful of senators would land on the conviction vote "" was whether a majority of senators in the narrowly divided chamber would decide to call more witnesses, particularly after the Bolton revelations. 
Democrats cited polling that showed the public broadly favored summoning witnesses to Trump's impeachment trial, and argued it was only fair to hear from Trump administration officials whom the White House had summarily blocked from testifying before the House, some even under a subpoena. But most Senate Republicans, many of whom took no public issue with the president's conduct, said it was not their responsibility to secure witnesses and documents, particularly when House Democrats didn't exhaust their options to obtain them, such as going to court. 
Unlike in the House, in which a handful of Democratic lawmakers split from their party to oppose either article of impeachment, Senate Democrats stayed united in their stance that Trump deserved to be removed from office for his conduct. 
Sen. Doug Jones (Ala.), who faces the toughest reelection bid for an incumbent Democrat this fall, chose to convict on both impeachment articles, saying he was 'deeply troubled' by the White House legal team's case arguing for 'virtually unchecked presidential power.' Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.), a freshman senator who has bucked her party on occasion, also voted guilty on both. 
So did Sen. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.), one of the few Democratic lawmakers who has a relationship with Trump and was seen as perhaps the White House's best chance at a bipartisan acquittal. Manchin, who in recent days began floating a censure resolution that gained little traction in either party, announced his decision shortly before senators gathered to vote at 4 p.m., and inside the chamber, Sinema approached him and the two whispered to one another and hugged.
'Despite the false claim that a president can do no wrong, the president is not entitled to act with blatant disregard for an equal branch of government or use the superpower status of the United States to condition our support of democracy and our allies on any political favor,' Manchin said. 
As for the lone party defector, the GOP backlash against Romney began to mount immediately, with the president's son, Donald Trump, Jr., calling on Senate Republicans to expel him from the conference. Romney's own colleagues were gentler in their disagreement, with Republican leaders saying they did not try to persuade him one way or another on the conviction vote. 
'He's made it very clear from the beginning, even on the witness vote, that he was going to go his own way,' said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.). 'This is one of those historical votes where everybody has to do what they think is the right thing.' 
The impeachment trial also became entwined with the 2020 Democratic presidential campaign, forcing the four senators still in the race "" Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Michael F. Bennet (Colo.) "" off the trail just weeks before the first nominating contests began Monday in Iowa.
At a campaign stop Wednesday morning in Derry, N.H., before he zipped back down to Washington, Sanders called Trump a 'pathological liar' who 'probably doesn't know the difference between truth and lies.'

The Vermont senator can quit and still move his agenda forward, says The Post's

Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders do not want it on their consciences that they helped reelect President Trump. The future of the country really does depend on how both of them act over the next few weeks. 
They should realize four things. First, if they don't work together, and fast, Trump really could win reelection. If the urgency of putting an end to a genuinely dangerous presidency was not clear before his bungling of the coronavirus crisis, it should be now. Second, they need each other to achieve their respective core goals, both in the short term and in the long run. Third, there is a history of the left working with a governing center to achieve substantial social reform. Finally, neither of them has a monopoly on wisdom. Each must pay attention to the other's central concerns.
What will be asked of them is not easy: Sanders has to acknowledge, quickly, that there is no way he is going to win the Democratic nomination he has spent five years fighting for. Biden has to reach out to a candidate who has regularly attacked him as a tool of the establishment and to a constituency of young voters who think he's over the hill. 
If they can't do all these things, they will strengthen Trump in November. The difficult truth is staring them in the face: They need each other to win.

Democrats showed in 2018 the good things that can happen when their progressive and moderate wings work together. The party grabbed control of the House with a popular-vote majority of nearly 10 million. That's enough to retake the White House.
If the vote for president matched the popular vote for House candidates in every state, according to calculations by my Brookings Institution colleague William Frey, the Democratic nominee would get 293 electoral votes. That means victory, but it's only 23 more than the 270 required to win the presidency, which is not much of a cushion. Biden thus badly needs the constituencies Sanders has mobilized, particularly Americans under 35. Biden will be sunk if they vote for third-party candidates or stay home.
In 2018, progressives realized they had an interest in victories by many politicians around the country with more moderate views than their own. Moderates, in turn, grasped the turnout and activism that progressives could provide. Both sides also understood that it's foolish to argue about whether elections depend solely on either mobilizing voters or persuading them. If all the wings of the Democratic Party don't mobilize, Biden will lose. But especially in swing states - Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Arizona are at the top of the list - Biden will also lose if he doesn't persuade at least some of Trump's 2016 voters to switch sides and many moderate independents and Republicans to come his way. 
This is why Biden needs Sanders, but also why Sanders needs to give Biden some room to do what he needs to do to win. Accepting defeat might make Sanders grumpy, but he can move forward with pride - and that is what he seemed to do when he signaled a de-escalation of the campaign Wednesday. He acknowledged he was ""losing"" but said his forces had ""won the ideological debate."" 
He was onto something. He has fundamentally altered the nature of the conversation in the Democratic Party. Together, he and Elizabeth Warren have moved even the most moderate Democrats to the left. His proposals for Medicare-for-all, free college and bold action on climate change, and his warnings about the dangers of concentrated corporate power, set the terms of this year's debate. Candidates were judged by how close or far they were from his core objectives. That's a big deal.
Moreover, Sanders's movement is now a permanent force in the Democratic Party, much like organized labor was in the old days, or the religious right is now in the GOP. Democrats will not be able to ignore the left wing that Sanders has brought to life. He made democratic socialism a popular idea among young Americans. Unlike their elders, they associate socialism not with the Soviet Union but with a decent, democratic society that pays attention to the needs of the powerless, the marginalized and the working class. A 2018 survey showed that 58 percent of adults under 30 identified socialism as a system that ""provides citizens with health insurance, retirement support, and access to free higher education""; only 38 percent saw it as government control of ""key parts of the economy, such as utilities, transportation and communications industries."" 
But for all his achievements, it's clear now that Sanders speaks for only about a third of Democrats. (So far, he has received just over 30 percent of the popular vote in the Democratic primaries.) His task is to accept his role as a source of pressure for far-reaching reform inside the Democratic coalition.
There's a role model for him: Sidney Hillman, the strategic mastermind of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the left wing of the labor movement of the 1930s and 1940s. The CIO gave critical support to Franklin D. Roosevelt when he needed it against the party's right wing, but it also pushed FDR in a more progressive direction.
Sanders and his movement should embrace the idea that they need a sympathetic moderate liberal - his name now is Joe Biden - in power to achieve anything they have in mind. They have a right to ask Biden for some reassurances, but they should not waste a lot of time on foolish platform fights or demands for symbolic gestures. What matters is the policy agenda Biden pursues after he is elected.
The good news for Biden is that there are many issues on which outreach to Sanders's supporters could also help the likely Democratic nominee with the broader electorate, too. A commitment to increasing the power of workers in an economy that has seen unions weaken sits well with both Sanders's objectives and Biden's Scranton, Pa., working-class roots. More vocal and aggressive moves on climate change would help reassure younger voters. Strong pledges to limit the power of big money in politics would reinforce the message House Democrats sent with their comprehensive elections and ethics bill, H.R. 1. Biden could also take some steps closer to Sanders on universal access to public universities and job training. And while Biden would be ill-advised to change his position on health care, he could shift from bashing Medicare-for-all to giving Sanders credit for moving the broader health-care argument in a more progressive direction.
Finally, Biden's pledge to work with Republicans is too central to his persona for him to abandon it. But he needs to do far more to show that he recognizes the growing power of right-wing radicalism in the GOP and its habit of obstructionism.
More broadly, Biden needs to make very clear that he accepts the Sanders movement's critique of Democratic politicians who gave in too readily to the right-wing political consensus that Ronald Reagan established after 1980. Democrats have spent too much time negotiating with themselves and offering preemptive concessions that rarely won them Republican support. They built the Affordable Care Act around Republican ideas, made one change after another at the GOP's request - and won not a single Republican vote on final passage. When they are in power, Democrats are terribly sensitive to Republican criticisms of deficit spending, and they work to bring budgets under control; then they look on when Republicans win power and let the red ink flow freely to finance tax cuts for their wealthy supporters. Sanders's backers are understandably tired of Democrats always looking over their right shoulders. 
Biden also should reject the premise of another foolish argument: that Democrats must choose between restoration or transformation as the core goal of the next four years. Plainly, the country needs both. Restoring the norms and values that Trump has ripped apart is a precondition of progress. But that's the point: What voters seek to restore is progress.
The next president needs to be mindful that Trump's election was a sign of how much transformation the country needs. The growing economic inequalities of the past 40 years - with their racial, regional and individual components - helped Trump win and made it easier for him to divide the country into warring factions. 
And here is what Biden and Sanders should acknowledge together: Democrats are a far more progressive party today than they were even in 2008, when Barack Obama was elected president. This is true both because of pressure from the inside - from Sanders and Warren, and from new left-of-center voices such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) and Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) - and because nearly everyone has a less sanguine view of unregulated capitalism since the great crash of 2008. 

Polling in the past few weeks suggests that 80 percent or more of Sanders's supporters are already inclined to vote for Biden over Trump. If Biden reaches out, as he should, Sanders should reciprocate by dissociating himself more forcefully than he has from the most toxic among the Bernie Bros - even though he also has a right to remind Democrats that the vast majority of his backers are idealistic partisans for social justice who don't spend their lives on Twitter. One Sanders organizer asked me in Iowa in January: ""Why do the media judge us by the loudest of our supporters rather than the kindest of our supporters?"" Sanders should also stop claiming that Biden's victory was a product of dastardly moves by ""the Democratic establishment."" In fact, Biden's victory was built on a foundation of African American votes in South Carolina and elsewhere, and on the intense desire of millions of middle-class Democrats to beat Trump.
It takes a coalition to save a country, and coalitions are hard. They succeed when their members focus on what they share rather than what pulls them apart. Starting with Sunday's debate, Biden and Sanders have to begin a process of reconciliation that will send a message to their respective supporters, and the rest of the nation, that change begins with getting Trump out of office - but it won't end there.
Two men in their late 70s should be especially mindful of how history will judge them. If they get this wrong, nothing else they have done will matter.

CONCORD, N.H. "" The Democratic Party's nomination campaign began with the biggest and most diverse field in history. More women and more candidates of color populated the field than ever before. Unless something changes quickly, the contest could devolve into a competition among only white men.
Despite having two women and an Asian American sharing the stage at Friday night's debate in New Hampshire, right now the Democratic race appears to be a contest among two white men in their late 70s, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former vice president Joe Biden, and another in his late 30s, former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg. Another septuagenarian, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, is waiting to pounce, depending on the results of the first four primaries and caucuses. 
The fact that this is a battle among white men represents an unexpected turn for a party whose success in the 2018 midterms depended heavily on an outpouring of support and activism by women and whose failure in 2016 was the result, in part at least, of a falloff in turnout among voters of color, especially African Americans. The party's future depends on both those groups and, overlapping with them, the active support of younger people.
The changing face of the Democratic Party is an oft-told story, celebrated by party leaders and by rank-and-file Democrats alike. It is a point of pride for Democrats that their party looks more like the changing American population than does the Republican Party, whose presidential candidates of late have gotten about nine of every 10 votes from whites.
 What has gotten less attention is the tension the diversification of the Democratic coalition has produced under the party's big tent. The rising parts of the population are the rising parts of the Democratic Party. They now want more than acknowledgment that their votes are important. They are not satisfied simply to cast their votes for a Democratic candidate. They want a bigger voice at the Democratic table.

Much has been said about the ideological divisions within the party, highlighted again during Friday's debate at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire by questions about whether Sanders's brand of democratic socialism would sink him in a general election against President Trump and take down other Democrats in Senate and House races or produce big turnout among a new coalition of voters.
Debates are waged over whether Medicare-for-all amounts to a budget-busting, complex, big-government idea or is the obvious and essential health-care future for a country where many people have no insurance or are saddled with high deductibles and other costs. Conflicts like that are among the choices Democratic voters will be weighing in the primaries and caucuses.
But there's another division that the party is struggling to resolve, which is who has power and who should have power.

More than a year ago pollster Anna Greenberg, looking ahead to 2020 and beyond, played down the ideological divisions among Democrats, but she made another important observation. She described Democrats as 'a party in flux' not over ideology but over that balance of power within the party's coalition. 
Greenberg said she saw the coming period as 'the last gasp of older white men who have control in the party.' 
The 2020 campaign was to be the moment when the rising coalition asserted and perhaps took power, but it has not worked out that way so far. There's no single reason that has turned out to be the case. Some people blame it on the fact that the first two states to vote, Iowa and New Hampshire, are predominantly white. Some blame it on the inability of candidates who have fallen to the sidelines to run better campaigns.

Three candidates of color "" entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii) and former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick "" remain as active but lagging candidates. Yang has his Yang Gang and has raised some money, but he does not have enough support to be a serious contender. Gabbard launched her campaign last February, and Patrick jumped into the race late, but neither has yet to make a mark.

But gone from the field are two black senators, Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and Cory Booker (N.J.), and the Latino former housing secretary Julián Castro. All entered the race with serious expectations. Harris became one of the most talked-about candidates in the early stages. But none of them, ultimately, was able to attract serious support or serious amounts of money. 
In addition to Gabbard, two other women remain "" Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.). While Gabbard has been a gadfly in the race, Warren and Klobuchar have played more significant roles. Gone among the female candidates are Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and author Marianne Williamson.
Warren entered the campaign as one of the three best-known and best-regarded candidates, along with Biden and Sanders. She set the pace with a flurry of plans for attacking corruption in government and concentrated power in the private sector. She led the field in Iowa at one point, but last Monday she finished a weak third in Iowa and appears to be struggling in New Hampshire.

Klobuchar has struggled from the start to break into the upper ranks, overshadowed by better-funded candidates and trying to make her mark as a moderate, results-oriented Democrat in a party that has been moving to the left. 'If you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me,' she said Friday night.
At Friday's debate, Warren was a quiet presence, staying out of the scrums for the most part and focusing on the message that has guided her candidacy while trying to present herself as someone who can unite the party. If that strategy doesn't give her a boost, she will have difficulty overtaking the leaders here.
Klobuchar had what might be the best night of her campaign, witty and sharp-tongued at the same time. She questioned whether Sanders could effectively lead the party in a general election, and she accused Buttigieg of taking the easy path by highlighting his outsider status and implicitly criticizing people with Washington experience. 
'It's popular to say and makes you look like a cool newcomer,' she said to the 38-year-old mayor. 'I don't think that's what people want right now. We have a newcomer in the White House and look where it got us. I think having some experience is a good thing.'
But she's had good debate performances before, and they've never translated into growth in support. She has remained in single digits in national polls and ended up fifth in Iowa. She hopes for better in New Hampshire but has to rise quickly to become a force in the nomination contest.
For many female voters and for many voters of color, this turn in the race has produced frustration and a feeling of being left out once again and a step down from when the campaign started a year ago.

President Trump on Tuesday night delivered his third State of the Union address at a key juncture in his presidency: It came on the eve of his likely acquittal in the impeachment trial, the 2020 Democratic nominating process saw its first results mere hours before the speech, and Trump's poll numbers have taken a turn for the better in recent weeks.
Here are some takeaways from the speech.
Impeachment bad blood
You wouldn't know from Trump's speech that his Senate impeachment trial was about to wrap up "" he didn't mention 'impeachment' once "" but that didn't mean it didn't loom over the proceedings.
Indeed, the speech began with the president not shaking the offered hand of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Trump simply handed her a copy of his speech, as presidents do, and turned around. It's not clear whether that was an intentional snub, but it was, at best, an awkward start to the night. 
Things became more clearly adversarial from there; raw feelings were on display throughout the speech, as Democrats expressed dissent when Trump made over-the-top claims or took what they felt were unfair shots.
There was even a brief protest by Democrats. When Trump mentioned lowering prescription drug costs, they stood and chanted 'H.R. 3,' putting three fingers in the air. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has declined to take up a House-passed bill on that topic. It was a scene you don't usually see in these speeches, and it was difficult to divorce from the events of the past four months.
In perhaps the night's most evocative moment, Pelosi concluded the scene by ripping up Trump's speech as he left the podium.
Overstated economic case
There is no question that the U.S. economy is strong and is a feather in Trump's cap as he confronts a reelection campaign. But in his speech Tuesday, Trump offered plenty of trademark hyperbole "" and many false claims.
'The years of economic decay are over,' Trump said toward the beginning of his remarks, declaring that he had 'moved rapidly to revive the economy.'
'In just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline, and we have rejected the downsizing of America's destiny,' he said. 'We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never, ever going back.'
You'd think Trump had arrested the backward momentum of his predecessor, rather than "" in large part "" continuing the progress and slightly bettering it. Gross domestic product growth has ticked above 3-percent in a few quarters on Trump's watch, but otherwise it has been around 2-percent for most of his presidency "" right where it was in the final years of President Barack Obama's. It's been around 2-percent over the past three quarters, in fact "" far shy of the 4, 5 and even 6 percent Trump has floated.
Trump added: 'Since my election, we have created 7 million new jobs, 5 million more than government experts projected during the previous administration.' And: 'In eight years under the last administration, over 300,000 working-age people dropped out of the workforce. In just three years of my administration, 3.5-million working-age people have joined the workforce.'
As with Trump's repeated comparisons of his record in three years vs. Obama's in eight, this is in large part because of the recession that Obama inherited. Job growth under Obama in his final years was about where it has been under Trump.
Trump has a good story to tell on the economy "" and creating jobs when you're at or near full employment would be a great point to make "" but he insists on apples-to-oranges comparisons and pretending that the economy he inherited was in some kind of free fall, which just wasn't the case.
Running against Obama?
Trump entered the House chamber to a raucous welcome, including chants of 'four more years' by the Republicans in the crowd who just probably fought off his removal from office.
And the speech, perhaps not surprising, given the man and the context, quickly took on the feel of a campaign rally. But as with some of the above quotes, you could be forgiven for thinking he was running against Obama, rather than Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren.
'If we hadn't reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witnessing this great economic success,' Trump said.
He added at another point: 'That's why my administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba.'
And: 'If we had not reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witness to America's great economic success.'
This is how Trump builds up his progress. But some of the comments seemed geared toward Trump's long-running campaign to use Obama as a foil rather than simply making a favorable comparison with him "" or making 2020 Democrats his foil.
The Limbaugh moment
Trump chose to include an unusual moment in his speech "" and one obviously designed to elicit a reaction.
Nearly an hour into the speech, Trump recognized the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, who was seated next to first lady Melania Trump. He then announced he was awarding Limbaugh the Presidential Medal of Freedom "" on the spot. The first lady put it around his neck right then and there, as Limbaugh expressed surprise.
Limbaugh announced this week that he has been diagnosed with advanced lung cancer. His opponents this week have been balancing their distaste for Limbaugh's political persona with their regard for his humanity. Trump seemed to invite the conversation to go even further with the highly unorthodox awarding of the nation's highest civilian honor.

The precinct caucuses in Iowa could have provided a coming-out moment for the Democratic Party and its field of presidential candidates. Instead, the caucuses resulted in a night of chaos and confusion and, for one more day at least, provided an unexpected gift to President Trump.
Collectively, Democrats were floundering and at least partially in the dark as the candidates left Iowa and headed to New Hampshire for events ahead of next week's primary. 
With no official results released until late afternoon Tuesday, the campaign descended into competing claims about who did well and who did not as the candidates sought to game the system to their advantage. When the Iowa Democratic Party released partial results, the numbers proved again that volatility lies ahead.
The situation was ready-made for a president who thrives on chaos, who likes nothing more than to seize on the weaknesses of his opponents. Trump's political style is to divide and conquer, which is how he won the presidency. He is now hoping to divide the Democrats as a way to disrupt the selection of his November rival, weaken his eventual challenger and raise broader doubts about the Democrats' readiness to govern.
For Trump, the breakdown in Iowa allowed the spotlight to turn back to him without any of the Democrats being able to fully celebrate victory and gain the kind of attention that other winners in Iowa have enjoyed. 
The caucuses were supposed to be the one moment for Democrats to seize the headlines in a week when much focus will be on the president, a week that includes Tuesday's State of the Union address and Wednesday's vote in the Senate that will end the impeachment process with an expected acquittal on both articles approved by the House.
The president, feeling both exonerated and emboldened, will use the two events as moments of triumph and as a return to business as usual. Whatever history says about the impeachment of this president, and however the coming campaign year treats him, the months since the impeachment proceedings began certainly have been beneficial to him politically.

Support for his removal from office has ticked down slightly from where it was when the House began its inquiry. Additionally, Gallup reported Tuesday that the president's job approval rating has risen to 49-percent, the highest of his presidency. Gallup's numbers reflect not only a rise in his approval among Republicans, to 94-percent, but also among independents, where his current 42 percent is five points higher than in early January and marks another high among those Americans.
Meanwhile, the Democratic candidates will be heading toward a debate Friday night in New Hampshire that could be as consequential as any of their encounters during the campaign. Whatever the final results from Iowa show, it was apparent from partial numbers that Democratic voters in Iowa remained fractured over their choice of a nominee, despite a year of campaigning.
Iowa sometimes produces genuine clarity through its caucus process, but this year something else happened. Candidates swarmed the state and found big crowds of voters there to see and hear them "" a sign of the energy that helped Democrats take control of the House in the 2018 midterms and determination to defeat the president in the general election.
With two dozen Democrats declaring their candidacies during 2019, Iowa seemed poised to become a more important testing ground than ever. But as the year moved from spring to summer and then to fall, another reality set in. No candidate was able to break away from the others. Iowa voters liked many of the candidates but seemed to love no one in particular.
On caucus night, turnout fell far short of the predictions of late last year, when many strategists were suggesting the number of participants would break the 2008 record of nearly 240,000. Whether the smaller turnout was a result of indecision or lessening enthusiasm about their field of candidates is something the Democrats will have to answer if they hope to win in November.

Based on partial data released Tuesday, which accounted for 62-percent of the nearly 1,700 precincts, it appeared possible that the eventual winner will have the lowest percentages of 'state delegate equivalents,' as Iowa Democrats calculate results, of any previous winner. The results also could have one candidate with more state delegate equivalents, and therefore the official winner, and another with more total votes among those who showed up at the precincts, who will claim a moral victory.

The partial results showed former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg leading in the battle for state delegate equivalents, a remarkable standing for a 38-year-old gay ex-mayor from a not-large city. Running second in SDEs was Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), though in these partial results he had more raw votes when participants stated their initial preferences and when they realigned. Buttigieg was benefiting from the complex formula for calculating SDEs.
Running third in the partial results was Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), with former vice president Joe Biden in fourth and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) not far behind him in fifth.
The partial results "" unless they were to change dramatically, and no one was predicting they would "" represent a particularly harsh blow to Biden, who began the campaign as the nominal front-runner, owing to his service as President Barack Obama's vice president and his four decades of experience in the Senate.
Overnight Monday, his campaign was raising the most pointed questions about the quality of the state party's data, a sign that the candidate and his advisers preferred to look to the next series of contests with Iowa's results permanently in question.




Electability has been Biden's principal argument in claiming to be at least a nominal front-runner. But only about a quarter of Iowa Democrats who said electability was most important backed him Monday. 
Buttigieg spoke to supporters late Monday night and delivered a speech as if he had been declared the winner. As a tactical maneuver, it was almost Trumpian. More than any of the candidates, he needed a strong finish "" in the top three at least and ahead of Biden at a minimum. He could end up with far more than that.
Warren, who faced difficult months at the end of last year, looked rejuvenated during the final weekend of the Iowa campaign and sounded so Tuesday when she started campaigning in New Hampshire, describing a race among three candidates: herself, Buttigieg and Sanders.
One other candidate could be a beneficiary of how everything played out in Iowa, and especially Biden's performance. Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg is skipping the first four states but is spending record amounts of money in the Super Tuesday states and beyond. His hopes depend on a weakened Biden and worries among many Democratic voters about the other alternatives. Campaign officials announced Tuesday that he will double his advertising in key states.
Democrats can survive Monday night's messy counting in Iowa. The calendar moves swiftly from here, and the absence of clarity in Iowa will give way to results of upcoming primaries and caucuses.
Whether those contests produce an effective nominee by the end of March and one who can rally the Democratic base and appeal to other voters who could help decide the general election is the question that worries many strategists. The president will do what he can to keep the Democrats off-balance and jumped at the opportunity he was given from Iowa. Democrats can't afford to give him more openings.

Senate Democrats, who have worked more closely with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) than anyone else the past 13-years, split into several factions when they consider the increasing likelihood of the self-proclaimed democratic socialist as their standard-bearer against President Trump.
Some question whether Sanders can appeal to key suburban swing voters critical to the party's hopes of claiming GOP Senate seats in Colorado, Maine, Arizona and North Carolina with such a liberal agenda. 'I think winning a primary election and winning a general election are two different things,' said Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.), a failed 2020 presidential contender himself. 
Others say the key is forging unity once the presidential primary contest is settled, bringing together all sides to help Democratic chances up and down the ballot. 'I'm not in the freakout caucus. I think the main thing is that we need to come together and support the eventual nominee, whoever that nominee is,' said Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who has previously chaired House and Senate campaign committees.
Still others just avoid the topic. 'I'm supporting whoever the Democratic candidate for president is,' said Sen. Gary Peters (Mich.), one of the few Democrats running a tough reelection campaign this year. 
Sanders arrived in the Senate in 2007 after 16-years in the House, an iconoclast with big ideas and not a lot of legislative gravitas. He was neither loathed nor loved. 
Then, in April 2015, Sanders went to the northeast corner of the Capitol lawn, and with no supporters around and just a few staff members, announced his long-shot bid for the Democratic presidential nomination against Hillary Clinton. 
Five years later, Sanders, who is not even a registered Democrat, is easily the most well-known member of the Senate caucus, pledging a 'revolution' that has vaulted him to the top of the 2020 field and left his colleagues wondering what comes next. 
Officially, the mantra for Senate candidates is to stick to the 2018 campaign themes that House Democrats used to win the majority, focusing on pocketbook issues such as the cost of health care and prescription drugs while promising a corruption-free government. 
'If you're in your state and you're talking to constituents about those kitchen-table issues that matter to them, that's what they're going to remember when they go to vote,' Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (Nev.), chairwoman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in an interview on Tuesday.
Cortez Masto, whose home state delivered Sanders an overwhelming caucus win on Saturday, cited her experience in 2016 as she ran and won in a state that also was hotly contested in the Clinton-Trump race. 'So yes, there is a presidential [race] going on, but at the end of the day, [voters] are going to be able to see you, because you're going to be able to spend more time in your state,' she said. 
Yet most senators and analysts understand how closely Senate races can track with presidential races. In Nevada, for example, Clinton and Cortez Masto both won by exactly 2.4-percentage points. 
Bennet, a moderate, struggled to raise money in the Democratic primary and quit the race this month after finishing with less than 1-percent in New Hampshire. He ran the Democrat Senatorial Campaign Committee in 2014, when President Barack Obama's low approval rating contributed to a nine-seat loss for Democrats. 
Heading into the 2020 primaries, Bennet said he hoped for a presidential nominee who could lift Democrats to a big Senate majority to pass some of the more sweeping legislative proposals. He paused for 17-seconds on Monday evening when asked about the potential of a Sanders nomination. 
'We need to nominate somebody in this process who is going to be able to win purple states like Colorado and lead us to a 55-senator majority in the Senate. That could be challenging,' he said. 
Part of the issue comes from Sanders's proposals, such as Medicare-for-all, with their multitrillion-dollar price tags. He has 14 co-sponsors for that proposal.
But Sanders's past includes controversial statements about socialist leaders, some of which were re-aired in Sunday's '60 Minutes' episode when, during an interview last week, he applauded Fidel Castro's literacy programs in Cuba. 
'Listen, I'm sure that all of those political prisoners languishing in Castro's jails, I'm sure all of those who were shot on a firing squad, I'm sure all of those who were tortured and live in New Jersey and can tell you their stories, would find the literacy program to really be worthy of losing all of their freedoms and all of their rights,' Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.), the only Cuban American in the Democratic caucus, said Monday night. 
Menendez said Sanders made a bad mistake that would hurt him in the campaign. 'It would definitely affect the race in terms of what people think,' said Menendez, who ran the senatorial campaign committee in 2010. 
Sanders has eight congressional endorsements, but just one is from a senator "" fellow Vermonter Patrick J. Leahy (D).
But many Senate Democrats think that, if he runs a disciplined and unified campaign, Sanders, 78, can win. 'I think that whoever the nominee is, the race is going to be about Trump betraying workers, and it can work for any number of Democrats,' Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio said. 
'We have a lot of great candidates, including a good number of my senator friends. I think every one of them will beat Trump,' Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) said. 
Sanders, as he did at Tuesday's debate in Charleston, S.C., is fond of mentioning polls showing him ahead of Trump nationally and in several of the key Midwestern battleground states. 
But a couple of hours before the debate, Van Hollen noted that Democrats need unity above all else. 'The thing I really want to hear tonight, after people talk about their disagreements, is each of them pledging to support 100-percent the nominee,' he said.
However, the debate often devolved into a shouting match as the candidates talked over each other and took personal shots. 
So, for now, some Democrats are planning their own campaigns regardless of who is at the top of the ticket. 
An underappreciated politician, Peters defeated a 16-year veteran House Republican in 2008, won reelection two years later in a brutal political climate and won his Senate seat in the tough 2014 season. 
'I've always been able to run above the Democratic base. I run my own race based on my own issues. So whoever the Democratic candidate is, I'll be supporting,' he said.

DES MOINES "" Four candidates were stuck in Washington, embroiled in the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump. Another, Joe Biden, delivered a speech that mentioned Trump an average of once every 17 seconds. Pete Buttigieg traveled to counties Trump won in 2016, trying to showcase his ability to win over the president's supporters.
And then, in the early evening, Trump himself arrived for a rally on the campus of Drake University here.
At a pivotal, potentially energizing moment for Democrats, preparing for the first votes of their long-awaited effort to unseat Trump, the presidential candidates found themselves Thursday reacting to his massive shadow rather than setting their own course. The scrambling reflected a deeper truth just four days before the Iowa caucuses: After four years of turmoil and anger, Democrats have yet to settle on the best path for defeating a president most of them consider the most damaging in memory.
To make matters worse, the contenders faced the prospect that the Senate vote on removing Trump could unfold at roughly the same time Monday night as Iowa caucus-goers begin assembling at their local precincts. And Trump will take center stage again Tuesday as he delivers the State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress, while Democrats absorb the caucus results and head to New Hampshire.
That's making this a highly unusual lead-up to the Iowa caucuses. With four candidates detained by the trial, several are relying heavily on allies or surrogates "" and in the case of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), also her dog "" to fill in on the campaign trail. Downtown Des Moines, normally a hive of activity in the days before the caucuses, was notably quiet Thursday.
With Trump on everyone's mind, Biden's speech, delivered at an elementary school in Waukee, was a blunt attempt to convey the contrast between Trump's tenure and the dignified presidency Biden hopes to embody. It marked a return to an earlier strategy of looking beyond the primary fight to the general election.
During his talk, lasting just under 19 minutes, Biden referred to Trump 64 times while ignoring his Democratic rivals. He criticized the president for withholding his tax returns, dismissing climate change, trying to abolish President Barack Obama's health-care law and failing to address gun violence. 
'I do not believe we're the dark, angry nation that Donald Trump sees in his tweets in the middle of the night,' Biden said. 'I look at Donald Trump and what he stands for, how he behaves, and what he's done. My response is always the same. America is so much better than this. So much better.'
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), after weeks of attacking Biden as insufficiently supportive of Social Security, turned his own fire on the president with a new television ad: 'Donald Trump wants to cut Social Security. We're not going to let that happen.' 
Warren, like Sanders, argues that the best way to take on Trump is to promote a far-reaching liberal agenda, making a case in the final days before Iowa that voters should not be 'afraid' to embrace big change. 
But from Washington, Warren taped an appearance with WHO-TV in Des Moines that focused more on the impeachment trial than that campaign message. 'We need to have a fair trial, and that means witnesses and documents,' Warren said, homing in on a topic that few Iowans have shown interest in discussing. 
She tried to contrast her plans to wrest power from special interests with Trump's governing style and willingness to reward supporters with influential positions.
'The way we're going to beat Donald Trump is to draw that distinction,' Warren said in the interview. 'I have the biggest corruption plan since Watergate and have been talking about this since the first day I got in the campaign.'
Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., stressed his role as a Washington outsider "" his own effort to distance himself from Trump as well as his Democratic rivals. In a significant shift Thursday, Buttigieg attacked Biden and Sanders by name, saying they represent political brands that Democrats must leave behind. 
'I hear Vice President Biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new,' Buttigieg said during a morning stop in Decorah, Iowa. 'But history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up is to look to the same Washington playbook and recycle the same arguments and expect that to work against a president like Donald Trump, who is new in kind.'
Then he rebutted Sanders, whose name his campaign has used repeatedly in fundraising emails even as the candidate himself had avoided criticizing him by name until Thursday.
'I hear Senator Sanders calling for a kind of politics that says you got to go all the way here and nothing else counts. . . . We've got to galvanize, not polarize, that American majority so that we can win.'
Throughout the campaign, and more noticeably during his Iowa push in the past month, Buttigieg has avoided criticizing his opponents by name, even as they sometimes slid into high-profile squabbles around him. But Thursday, wearing a full suit instead of a shirt and tie, he made explicit references to his opponents instead of implications, and he acknowledged that time was running out to make his case.
Biden shot back later in the day, poking at the low vote totals required for Buttigieg to win a mayor's race in South Bend. 'Some things are self-evident when it comes to this,' Biden said, when asked at a Dairy Queen about his ability to do well in the caucuses. 'I've got more than 8,600 votes in my life.'
But the day also presented a jarring visual representation of the Democrats' challenge. Trump drew a passionate, raucous crowd of supporters that none of the candidates running against him has been able to match. It also yielded a foretaste of the months to come, when Democrats will have to vie for attention with a president who has proved uniquely adept at making himself the center of public attention and drama.

If Sanders and Warren stress the need for a powerful contrasting agenda, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), like Biden and Buttigieg, touts her ability to win over Trump voters.
'We really leaned into the electability argument because Amy's been so effective in doing well in blue, purple and red counties in Minnesota,' her campaign manager, Justin Buoen, said at a breakfast hosted by Bloomberg News. 
'That's why we've begun to pick up at the end, because that is what is on their mind: Who can actually deliver in November?' Buoen said. 
He stressed that Klobuchar has focused more than her rivals on the 31 Iowa counties that voted for Obama in 2012 and switched to Trump in the last election. 'Amy is willing to go in and face the questions in their community and learn about their community and talk to these voters where they are,' he said. 
Biden and his surrogates have been even more explicit, encouraging Iowans to become poll-readers and pundits and consider how battleground-state voters might act in the fall. In many of those states, Biden leads Trump in head-to-head polling. 
Biden said in his speech Thursday that he successfully campaigned on behalf of other Democrats across the nation in the last midterm elections.
'In 2018, I went to 24 states for 65 candidates,' he said. 'I took on Trump all over the country and beat him. In fact, we beat him like a drum "" and in the process took back the majority in the House. We should remember that this year.'
His own campaign has taken on a new sense of urgency in the closing days before Iowa, where Sanders leads with 23.8-percent support, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls. Biden is in second place with 20.2-percent, but time is running out to reach voters. 
Before Biden spoke at an event Wednesday night, a staffer warned his supporters that there were only about 100 hours before the first presidential votes are cast since 2016.

Sanders's dust-ups with Clinton and rivals raise 2016-style concerns

AMES, Iowa "" On Tuesday, when Democrats had hoped to focus Americans squarely on President Trump's impeachment trial, many in the party were instead watching in alarm and dismay as a fresh spat erupted between Hillary Clinton and the candidate she defeated in 2016, Sen. Bernie Sanders.
In comments published early Tuesday, Clinton left open the possibility that she might not support Sanders if he is the party's nominee. The remarks unleashed fresh angst less than two weeks before the Iowa caucuses amid a flurry of other attacks dividing the presidential candidates and their allies.
Sanders (I-Vt.) has been engaged in battles with rivals on various fronts over the past week "" squabbling with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) over whether he once said a woman could not be president, attacking former vice president Joe Biden with an out-of-context video about Social Security and issuing a rare apology after a top surrogate called Biden corrupt. 
The conflicts have reignited Democratic fears that, whoever becomes the nominee, the party will rupture as it did four years ago, when divisions between the Clinton and Sanders camps marred the primaries and the summer convention, and were blamed by many for contributing to her loss to Trump that November.
'Nobody wants to re-litigate 2016. I don't want Democrats focused on the last campaign; I want to focus on the next campaign,' said Terry McAuliffe, the former Virginia governor and former head of the Democratic National Committee. 'People have to check their attacks. We can't get in the mud pit where Donald Trump wants to be. Let's not be playing on his turf.'
'If Bernie is the nominee,' he added, 'everyone has to rally.'
Rebecca Katz, a liberal New York-based consultant, put the blame squarely on Clinton.
'This is bringing up old wounds,' Katz said. 'It's four years later, and the nominee in 2016 is not saying for certain whether they are going to support the nominee in 2020? That is unacceptable.'
Katz added: 'This is Hillary Clinton. She had to know how explosive these remarks would be. And she did it anyway. And she did it now.'
'There's enough post-traumatic stress out there already,' said former senator Barbara Boxer (D-Calif). 'I think it's best if we just move forward. But everybody has a right to say what's in their heart.'
Clinton's comments, published just hours before Democrats began to make their case on impeachment in Washington and as several candidates launched a full day of campaigning here in Iowa, came in an interview promoting a documentary about her that will premiere at Sundance Film Festival on Saturday.
In the film, she offered a blunt assessment of Sanders, casting him as a career politician who has deceived his supporters into believing he could implement change.
'He was in Congress for years,' she said. '. . . Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done. He was a career politician. It's all just baloney, and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it.' 
When asked in the interview with the Hollywood Reporter if that assessment still held, she responded, 'Yes, it does.' Asked if she would support him if he won the nomination, she demurred, saying, 'I'm not going to go there yet. We're still in a very vigorous primary season. '
She also criticized the willingness of his supporters to antagonize his political rivals.
It's 'not only him, it's the culture around him,' she said. 'It's his leadership team. It's his prominent supporters. It's his online Bernie Bros and their relentless attacks on lots of his competitors, particularly the women. And I really hope people are paying attention to that because it should be worrisome that he has permitted this culture "" not only permitted, [he] seems to really be very much supporting it. And I don't think we want to go down that road again where you campaign by insult and attack and maybe you try to get some distance from it, but you either don't know what your campaign and supporters are doing or you're just giving them a wink.'
The comments triggered an outburst of criticism that flew across social media. Tommy Vietor, a former aide to President Barack Obama, tweeted that Clinton's comments were 'inexcusable' and the entire party needed to get behind the nominee, Sanders or not. 
'Don't kick up this . . . right before Iowa, especially after complaining about Bernie's lack of support in 2016,' he wrote, noting that he was 'TERRIFIED' about the party not being united in the general election.
A Clinton spokesman, Nick Merrill, responded to say that Clinton isn't committing to any candidate in the primary and pointed to her record of working for Democrats, including former opponents like Obama. 
'Let's all take a deep breath, give her the benefit of the doubt for once, - look at history,' he wrote on Twitter.
 

Clinton late Tuesday mocked the hubbub she had created and seemed to suggest support for Sanders if he is the nominee.
'I thought everyone wanted my authentic, unvarnished views!' she tweeted. 'But to be serious, the number one priority for our country and world is retiring Trump, and, as I always have, I will do whatever I can to support our nominee.'
Clinton's comments seemed to feed into a growing concern among more-moderate and establishment Democrats that Sanders, an enduring and energetic force if a polarizing one, could damage the party if he captured the nomination. Others, however, worried that the convulsion could further alienate Sanders's supporters, many of whom believe the 2016 race was stacked against him and fear the same happening in 2020. 
'No one loves Hillary Clinton more than I do, but those remarks are not helpful,' said Ed Rendell, the former Pennsylvania governor. 'Whoever wins, we have to get behind them. There's no time this year for Democrats to resolve old grievances.'


Jen Psaki, a veteran Democratic consultant and former top Obama aide, said that it was clear Clinton 'hasn't buried the hatchet, and she needs to bury the hatchet.' 
'There are a number of things that can simultaneously be true,' she said. 'One, she shouldn't have said it; two, it represents the view of many Democrats; and, three, he's always been underestimated.'
The Sanders style of campaigning has increasingly grated on Biden and his campaign, who view his tactics as unfair and out of bounds. Sanders's campaign aides promoted an out-of-context video of Biden that suggested he agreed with the proposals of then-House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) to cut Social Security. Sanders said over the weekend that he wished they had shown the fuller context but stood by his criticisms of other comments by Biden on entitlements.
On Monday, a top Sanders ally wrote an op-ed saying that 'Biden has a big corruption problem and it makes him a weak candidate.' Sanders apologized for the critique.
Some Democrats lamented that Sanders has not faced enough scrutiny, even as he has been repeatedly underestimated by some party leaders. 
'What Hillary is saying is a general concern I have and a lot of other people have, too,' said Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), a former presidential candidate who has endorsed Biden. 'Socialism and taking away people's private health care and, you know, all these things that make it very very difficult to beat Donald Trump in the industrial states we need to win. Hillary knows that better than anybody, how hard that is. To me, she's articulating a concern that a lot of us have.'
Besides his squabbles with Biden, Sanders also has exchanged barbs with Warren over her claim that Sanders told her during a private 2018 meeting that a woman wouldn't defeat Trump "" a claim Sanders has denied. The disagreement spilled onto the presidential debate stage last week. 
Although the disagreements left some Democrats quaking, others found a bright side. 
'I love it,' said Bakari Sellers, a former state legislator from South Carolina. 'Politics is a contact sport. Unfortunately, Democrats think politics is tiddlywinks, which is why we got drummed by Donald Trump, who plays by no rules. We have to get tougher.'
Other Democratic presidential candidates sought to gain advantage through comparison. The super PAC supporting Biden saw an opening to distinguish its candidate, releasing a new ad called 'The Storm' that shows choppy ocean waters amid text that reads, 'Joe Biden. A President to Right the Ship,' and says he's 'The Democrat Who Can Lead Through the Storm.'
Former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has campaigned as someone who can turn the page on controversies of the past, reiterated that argument.
'I didn't love going through the experience of our party divisions in the past,' Buttigieg said in response to questions about Clinton. 'I'm focused now on making sure that the future is better.'
Until the recent battling, the 2020 race has been tame by comparison to 2016 "" a fact that some held on to. 
'In the immediate short term, all of these soap-operatic outbursts are a distraction,' said Robert Zimmerman, a top donor and DNC member from New York. 'Do I think it's going to prevent us from being united? I don't think so. But we have to be very disciplined about it. Because it wouldn't be the first time we saw a fight get out of control.'
In Iowa, a representative of those mostly too young to take part in the past disputes demanded that her elders cease the current ones.
'Everyone stop fighting about 2016 please thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!! No need for that!!!!!!!!!!! Our President is literally on trial right now!!!!!!!!! Focus on 2020!!!!!!!! Thank you!!!!!!!!!!' tweeted Olivia Habinck, president of the College and Young Democrats of Iowa.

Democrats have more optimism about ticket, but uncertainties remain
Former vice president Joe Biden's sudden emergence as the Democratic front-runner and the disruptions caused by the spreading coronavirus are altering calculations about the shape of a general election campaign that only weeks ago many Democrats feared was tipping in the direction of President Trump.
Biden's string of primary victories over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has improved the outlook of many Democratic strategists, who had feared that a Sanders nomination, which looked increasingly possible, would make winning the general election more difficult and could threaten down-ballot candidates as well.
Biden's campaign has begun to shift its focus to the general election even as the nomination contest with Sanders continues. The two Democrats will debate Sunday night on CNN and face another round of primaries on Tuesday. In those four contests - Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio - Biden is heavily favored and likely to add to his growing lead in delegates.
Both the Trump campaign and Democratic strategists have been focused first on the four key states that made Trump president in 2016: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida. The campaigns also expect to compete in North Carolina, Arizona, Minnesota and possibly one or two other states in an effort to expand their paths to an electoral majority.
Biden's sizable victory in Michigan on Tuesday, powered by a sharp rise in suburban turnout and strength across the state, has generated a surge of optimism and some cautionary warnings among Democrats about their prospects of winning that crucial state and others who will decide the outcome in November if the former vice president is at the top of the ticket. The turnout gave them hope that the energy behind Democrats' decisive victories during the last midterms could spell trouble this year for Trump. 
""The dynamics in Michigan have not shifted from 2018, and that is bad news for the Republicans,"" said Richard Czuba, an independent Michigan pollster.

The bigger unknown is what political impact the spreading coronavirus could have in November. The massive disruption to daily lives and the meltdown in financial markets are likely to affect voters' views of their own futures and potentially the two candidates as well, but in what ways no one can say.
Judgments on the government's response to the crisis, pro or con, could affect swing voters as they make decisions in the fall, while shocks to the economy and the possibility of a recession could rob the president of the single strongest issue he has had in his bid for a second term. 
""Historically, there are periods in presidential history where people just want calmness after a storm,"" said Susan MacManus, emerita professor of political science at the University of South Florida. ""That would be one of the key things, is to see whether Biden can project calmness and competence after the tumultuous period we've been in.""
If anything, the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus makes planning for the general election more difficult, but also might open the possibility of other states coming into play by later in the year. Campaigns are only now beginning to assess but lack trustworthy data in the middle of the pandemic to be able to make decisions with confidence.
Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's communications director, expressed confidence about the president's prospects for winning a second term, asserting that the electoral map looks favorable whether the challenger is Biden or Sanders. 
""Joe Biden will have a problem with union workers all across the upper Midwest because of his support for the job-killing NAFTA and TPP [Trans Pacific Partnership] deals, so this myth of Biden as some kind of blue-collar hero will be destroyed,"" he said in an email message. ""Biden's support for the public option in health care is just another way of crowding our employer-provided health insurance that people know and value."" 

Biden's team is operating on painful lessons Democrats learned from 2016 on what could be the new realities of campaigning in a time of a pandemic. ""It's incredibly important that we start from a standpoint of how wide the landscape could be,"" said a senior Biden campaign official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment of the race. ""It is a detailed belief that I have that you can't take anything for granted. . . . I'm not willing to sit here and say, 'We don't need Florida, and Ohio is dead.' ""
Democrats hope for the increase in turnout, particularly among suburban women, that helped them win the House in 2018 to continue.
Meanwhile, the Trump campaign is counting on increased turnout among voters in exurban and rural areas who sat out 2016 but could make the difference in November. It's also making appeals to Latinos and African Americans.
One Biden campaign official said that because of what the Trump campaign is doing to communicate to voters of color and what likely will be new rules of the road for voter contact and mobilization, the campaign will have to put even greater emphasis than ever in assuring that the party's core voters turn out in November. 
That means greater breadth and depth in trying to reach all potential supporters. ""We're going to have to do the work of persuasion and get out there and make sure people turn out,"" the official said.
Florida appears to be a must-win state for the president. If he successfully replicates his narrow victory of 2016, the three northern states, or equivalent substitutes, become crucial for the Democrats. Of those three, Wisconsin is considered the most difficult.
Democratic strategists see Biden as better positioned than Sanders to reach an electoral college majority, in large part because the senator from Vermont's past and current statements about Cuba and his democratic socialist agenda would cost him significantly among Hispanic voters in Florida. That doesn't mean Sanders would have no path to 270 electoral votes, only that his margin for error would be smaller than for Biden. 
These same strategists say Biden appears able to put together a coalition of African Americans, suburban women and enough working-class white voters to improve on Hillary Clinton's performance in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which she lost by a combined 77,000 votes. 

But some Democrats are more cautious in their assessments of Biden's prospects. They worry that Trump is working to persuade voters of color either to defect or stay on the sidelines and see a need for the Democratic nominee to engage with those communities as much as they appear to be looking to attract white working-class voters.
The Trump strategy ""is to amp up their base with messages that stoke fear across the electorate and draw defection from the Democratic electorate,"" said Patrick Schuh, Michigan state director for America Votes, a progressive organization. ""Democrats and the progressive coalition are energized right now, but is running against Donald Trump enough to keep that coalition energized? We have to appeal to both white working-class voters and voters of color.""
Florida's primary on Tuesday could offer some clues about the fall campaign, but Clinton routed Sanders there in the 2016 primary and still lost the state to Trump in November. Biden is seen as a stronger candidate in that state than Sanders. 
Trump won Florida by just over a percentage point and won each of the three northern states by less than a percentage point and a combined total of just 77,000 votes. He rates as a very slight favorite to win Florida again. 
Steve Schale, a Florida-based Democratic strategist who is part of the group that formed Unite America, the super PAC helping Biden, said his state has been through so many close elections at the national and state level that we should expect another in November. 
Florida's voting patterns are shifting, but he said the changes have not altered the overall partisan split in the state. ""Democrats are doing wildly better in south Florida than before, and Republicans are seeing huge growth in places like Naples and Fort Myers. They keep balancing each other out."" He predicted that two media markets in the central part of the state - Orlando and Tampa - will determine the outcome.
Some Democrats worry that Trump has been effective in registering voters who would be partial to the president but did not turn out in 2016. Many of these voters live outside of major population centers. ""They have done a good job registered downscale, white voters,"" said Jim Messina, Obama's 2012 campaign manager. Florida is one and Pennsylvania is another, he said.
Another issue that concerns some Democrats is the potential resistance among some Hispanic voters - Cuban Americans and Venezuelan immigrants - to a Democratic nominee. ""It is extremely sensitive territory for members of that community to know that U.S. leaders, especially the president of the United States will stand with them,"" said one Florida Democratic politician speaking privately. ""Biden will have to deal with that directly.""
MacManus identified another potential weakness for Biden in Florida. ""Over a third of our voters are the two youngest generations,"" she said. ""If they can't be encouraged to turn out and vote for Biden, that's a really big problem.""
Of the three crucial northern states, Democrats feel best now about Michigan followed by Pennsylvania and then Wisconsin, which is seen as the tipping-point state for November, meaning the state that could give one candidate or the other the 270th electoral vote.
Trump campaign officials have made clear they will compete hard in Minnesota, which Clinton carried narrowly in 2016. Democrats agree that it is a state they must watch carefully because of its demographics. The Republicans will target other states as well but are not likely to carry them unless the president is winning by bigger margins than in 2016.
Democrats long have seen Arizona and North Carolina as targets and believe with Biden as the nominee both are even more attractive because of his potential ability to build a broad coalition. 
Former president Barack Obama won North Carolina in 2008 before losing it in 2012, and Trump carried it in 2016. Arizona's changing demographics and a costly and competitive Senate race that Democrats are eyeing make it attractive. If Wisconsin proves too difficult for Democrats, Arizona's electoral votes could compensate.
""Democrats are going to wage holy war to put Arizona and North Carolina into play, and recent events have made that more doable,"" Messina said.
Countering that, Trump's team came close enough in Minnesota in 2016 to warrant a serious investment there. New Hampshire, too, was quite close in 2016 and, given the Trump campaign's vast resources, worth going for. Both sides will treat it as a legitimate battleground despite its small size. 
Republicans also have talked about New Mexico as a state Trump could win, but Democrats are skeptical that he can turn the state red. Meanwhile, Biden's team will look seriously at competing in Ohio and even Iowa, even though Trump won both handily four years ago.

Former vice president Joe Biden moved aggressively Sunday to capitalize on his dramatic South Carolina victory, welcoming a round of key endorsements and insisting in television interviews that he alone can unite his anxious party and stave off the ascent of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
Biden's newfound confidence came as like-minded contenders confronted pleas to drop out and back him ahead of this week's primary elections - and as Democratic operatives deliberated over the timing and nature of those decisions.
A significant boost for Biden came Sunday evening, when former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg - one of his rivals for moderate votes - ended his campaign with a speech that, while not an endorsement, echoed Biden's arguments for consolidating behind him. 

Several influential Democrats from Super Tuesday states also gave Biden a lift on Sunday as they announced their support, including former senator Barbara Boxer of California. In Virginia, Rep. Jennifer Wexton - who won her suburban district in 2018, turning the seat blue for the first time in 38 years - endorsed Biden, calling him a ""steady, empathetic leader.""
Wexton's nod came after other prominent Virginia Democrats such as Sen. Tim Kaine, former governor Terry McAuliffe and Rep. Robert C. ""Bobby"" Scott endorsed Biden - a reflection of the urgency in the party's establishment to counter Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist.
Biden's efforts are rooted in his campaign's belief that he needs to use the burst of momentum and attention from South Carolina to rally Democrats to his side before Tuesday's elections, when 14 states and one territory will vote to award 34 percent of the convention delegates. Biden has lagged behind rivals in organizing and fundraising for months.
Biden attempted to make up for past deficiencies with a round-robin set of television appearances in which he contrasted his centrist approach with Sanders's pitch for a federal overhaul, which centers on a move toward a single-payer health-care system.
""People aren't looking for a revolution,"" Biden said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""They're looking for results.""
On NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" the former vice president boasted of the gains already seen by his campaign, which has struggled since its start to keep pace with better-financed candidates.
""A lot of supporters stepped up the last 24 hours; we raised over $5 million,"" Biden said.
While Saturday's South Carolina's primary was a thunderclap - Biden decisively won the contest, in which African American voters had a significant say for the first time this election season - it provided an affirmation of his candidacy rather than a guarantee of coming success. Sanders is polling strongly in many Super Tuesday battlegrounds, and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising in those states.
""This race is a long way from being over and is as competitive as ever,"" said Shelia A. Huggins, a member of the Democratic National Committee from North Carolina, which votes on Tuesday. ""Joe is still in the game. But Democratic voters here and everywhere are more strategic than decided at this point. Everyone wants to beat [President] Trump. What they're debating is just how much change they want to see.""
Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii remained in the Democratic race on Sunday night. But throughout the day, there was pressure on Buttigieg and Klobuchar, in particular, to consider ending their bids after they struggled in South Carolina and the Nevada caucuses to expand their appeal among minority voters. Liberal investor Tom Steyer dropped out late Saturday.
Those conversations - a flurry of phone calls and meetings - rippled with political calculations as top Democrats mapped out the brutal stretch ahead. 
For many Biden allies, Bloomberg - the billionaire centrist whose name will appear on ballots for the first time Tuesday - remains the biggest headache, and they are hopeful that he may soon decide to bow out. On Sunday, they passed around a clip from MSNBC in which David Plouffe, Barack Obama's 2008 campaign manager, said, ""The reality is Bloomberg needed Biden to lose South Carolina to have any chance.""
""Bloomberg is the one in focus because he has the resources to go on indefinitely and compete and divide the center-left vote with Biden,"" said David Axelrod, a senior adviser in the Obama White House.
Although Biden's campaign would welcome a narrowed field, several allies are also informally telling allies of Klobuchar and Warren to consider staying in the race until Tuesday night, to deny Sanders a major delegate haul in the Super Tuesday states of Minnesota and Massachusetts, according to three people briefed on the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly.
In the arcane process that Democrats use to pick nominees, delegates are awarded proportionally to any candidate who hits a threshold of 15 percent of the vote. Those rules put a premium on candidates who have broad support to win statewide, which determines a portion of the delegates, and also win individual congressional or state Senate districts, which account for the rest. And the setup benefits campaigns that can pinpoint the areas where they can either win a few extra delegates - or potentially deny an opponent from doing so.
Fourteen states and one U.S. territory will hold nominating contests on Tuesday, to award about one-third of the 1,991 delegates needed to clinch the nomination. Tuesday's states also include Arkansas, Maine, Utah, Oklahoma and Colorado.
After winning 60 percent of the African American vote in South Carolina, Biden's Super Tuesday outlook is best in states where those voters represent a high percentage of the Democratic electorate, such as Alabama. 
""Once things start settling, you'll see that Joe Biden will overwhelmingly take more delegates,"" Frank Love, the Arkansas state House minority leader, predicted Sunday, as Biden's wife, Jill, campaigned in North Little Rock. The core reason, he added, was that Biden was the partner of ""the greatest president of our generation"" and is ready to defeat Trump and pick up that Obama legacy.
Sanders's campaign aides say that he is ready to make gains with younger, more liberal African American voters in states such as North Carolina and have argued that South Carolina is older and more moderate than most of the states voting on Tuesday.
""Wait until you see what happens in other states,"" said Sanders deputy campaign manager Ari Rabin-Havt. ""Transmuting a population, one state's population to every state in the country, is a mistake.""

Bloomberg has attempted to make inroads with African American voters but has encountered continued problems over his past support of stop-and-frisk, a police strategy that opponents say is a form of racial profiling. Before announcing his candidacy, he apologized for defending the practice.
As Bloomberg spoke Sunday in Selma, Ala., at Brown Chapel AME Church, about 10 people stood and silently turned their backs to him. The incident caused a stir in the church, but Bloomberg continued his remarks without interruption. Others continued to listen, some cheering and applauding.
Biden and Sanders are now running near polar opposite campaigns. The once-ailing Biden operation is trying to ride the wave of momentum and attention as he reminds voters of his work alongside Obama and warns them of the perils of backing Sanders.
""I have gotten major, major things done. I'm able to cross the aisle and get things done. And so I think it's about who can not only win, bring along a Senate and keep a House, the House of Representatives, but who can then get something done,"" Biden said on CNN.
Sanders, meanwhile, is roaring before thousands at rallies and is counting on his grass-roots organizing in states such as California and Texas, which he has been building since his insurgent 2016 campaign.
Sanders raised $46.5 million in February, his presidential campaign said Sunday, a huge sum that could help sustain him in a lengthy battle for the nomination. The senator from Vermont won nominating contests in Nevada and New Hampshire last month before placing a distant second in South Carolina.
Sanders, who has criticized Biden for his past backing of military intervention in Iraq and his support of free trade, attacked Biden on Sunday as an ally of the wealthy and centrist Democratic establishment that he is trying to overhaul.
Speaking at a rally in San Jose on Sunday, Sanders said: ""At a time when the American people are sick and tired of endless wars, of the terrible death rate we have seen from these wars, the trillions of dollars we have spent on these wars, please do not forget Joe Biden voted for the war in Iraq.""
""We've got to be honest,"" Sanders told the crowd. ""Which campaign can beat Trump?"" His supporters chanted ""Bernie! Bernie!""
Most national Democrats treaded carefully as they approached the candidates and senior aides to struggling campaigns, knowing that the decision to drop out is deeply personal as well as political. With Obama on the sidelines and former nominee Hillary Clinton also quiet, there was also open debate about who, if anyone, had enough political capital to force an exit.
Warren, for her part, showed no signs of relenting. Her campaign announced that she raised $29.3 million last month, more than doubling her January haul thanks to a boost from her well-reviewed debate turn in Nevada - and the campaign increased its advertising spending in Super Tuesday states to $2.4 million. A pro-Warren super PAC is also spending millions.
Klobuchar's aides and confidants said she was campaigning hard ahead of Super Tuesday and felt good about her chances in her home state. 
""I want to go everywhere,"" Klobuchar told a Utah television station on Sunday. 
Buttigieg on Sunday met with former president Jimmy Carter near Carter's home in Plains, Ga. Carter told reporters, ""He doesn't know what he's going to do after South Carolina.""
Buttigieg replied, ""Every day, we'll do the math.""

Hours later, Buttigieg dropped out before a rapturous crowd in South Bend that chanted ""2024! 2024!""
""The truth is that the path has narrowed to a close for our candidacy, if not for our cause,"" he said.

MODERATE DEMOCRATS UNITE 
Klobuchar, Buttigieg offer their support

A parade of establishment Democrats began coalescing around Joe Biden on Monday, an attempt to bolster the former vice president and stall Sen. Bernie Sanders's ascent as voters in 14 states prepared to cast ballots Tuesday, the most consequential day of the presidential nominating contest. 
On a day with cascading developments that rapidly recast the presidential race, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) dropped out and rushed to join Biden at his rally in Dallas on Monday night. In a visual symbol of Biden's attempts to consolidate the moderates in the party, former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg - who dropped out Sunday night and who had an intensely frosty relationship with Klobuchar - also scrambled to get to Texas and endorse Biden. 
""We need a politics that's about decency, a politics that brings back dignity. That's what Joe Biden has been practicing his entire life,"" Buttigieg said at a restaurant in Dallas, ahead of the rally where Klobuchar declared: ""I cannot think of a better way to end my campaign than joining his."" 


Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman who ended his presidential bid in November, joined Biden on stage at the end of the Dallas rally - and concluded a speech by inviting him for dinner at a nearby Whataburger. 
Biden seemed taken aback by the swift change in fortunes. He told Buttigieg that he reminded him of his late son, Beau, the highest compliment he can offer. He told the crowd Klobuchar has a long political future ahead, and he told O'Rourke, whose candidacy was marked by liberal positions on gun control, ""You're going to take care of the gun problem with me. You're going to be the one who leads this effort."" 
It was the second straight day that moderates, previously paralyzed over whom to rally behind, rushed to join Biden's campaign. Harry M. Reid, a former Senate majority leader from Nevada, endorsed Biden along with other Democrats including Susan E. Rice, a former national security adviser to President Barack Obama; political activist and actress Alyssa Milano; Victoria Reggie Kennedy, the widow of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.); and Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.).
There are still looming questions about Biden - his propensity for gaffes, the moments when he searches for words or, on Monday, his struggle to come up with well-worn phrases in the Declaration of Independence before shouting, ""You know . . . the thing!"" - but his campaign has found unmistakable new momentum that it is hoping to carry into the elections Tuesday.
Not everyone was playing to his benefit, however. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg both pledged Monday to stay in the race.
""I'm in it to win it,"" Bloomberg said. He has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the primary contest and will appear on ballots for the first time Tuesday.
Warren's current plan is to remain an active candidate all the way to the convention, even if she is not accumulating significant numbers of delegates. She says that will give her some leverage over the party's platform and any other issues that might be at the forefront in Milwaukee. 
She continued her refrain Monday that her operation is built ""for the long haul,"" and she received an endorsement from Emily's List, which works to elect women in politics. 
The super PAC supporting her candidacy is raising money for a big TV ad buy in states like Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio, which vote March 17, according to a person familiar with Persist PAC's operations who was not authorized to openly discuss the group's strategy and spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
Sanders remains perhaps the most formidable force in the race, finishing in the top two in all four early states and holding on to a polling advantage in numerous delegate-rich states that will vote Tuesday. He also has a significant financial edge and a grass-roots army that Biden so far has lacked, and he was defiant Monday in the face of the moderate consolidation.
""Look, we are taking on the establishment. And I fully understand - no great surprise to me - that establishment politicians are not going to endorse us,"" Sanders told reporters in Salt Lake City, just minutes before the news broke that Klobuchar was ending her campaign and planning to support Biden.
""The establishment will rally around the establishment candidate,"" he said. ""That's the simple reality.""
President Trump, who has repeatedly tried to offer sideline commentary about the Democratic contest, tweeted with glee: ""They are staging a coup against Bernie!"" 


What began a year ago as a historically large and diverse Democratic field has quickly narrowed to five remaining contenders. With the two youngest major candidates dropping out, all of the remaining major candidates are septuagenarians. 

In Tuesday's primaries, 1,357 delegates are up for grabs, nearly a third of the total and the most of any single day in the Democratic race. California and Texas are the biggest prizes, but delegate-rich states like Virginia, North Carolina, Massachusetts and Colorado will also vote. 
Top advisers to the campaigns agree that Sanders is poised to win a big delegate haul, and the main question is whether it will set him on an insurmountable course toward the nomination.
""After watching this campaign unfold, after watching 10 debates, there's no way you can rationally believe that Joe Biden is strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump,"" said Ari Rabin-Havt, a deputy campaign manager for Sanders.
Shortly after Reid announced his endorsement of Biden, Faiz Shakir, who is Sanders's campaign manager but also worked for Reid, wrote on Twitter: ""Disappointing. I'll forever have respect and love for Senator Reid. But I'm old enough to remember when he thought Biden's ideas were worthy of being put in a fireplace.""
Biden is hoping that the momentum from his romping South Carolina win, and the party's efforts to consolidate behind him, will be enough to offset his campaign's continuing deficiencies. He is spending the least on ads, has one of the thinnest organizations and saw his candidacy stall at a time when most other campaigns were banking early votes. 
Biden hopes to win among Southern states that more closely mirror South Carolina, where he won nearly 50 percent of the vote Saturday, in part because of his giant lead among African American voters. 
His campaign has since received a large fundraising boost, with $5 million coming Saturday and at least $5 million Sunday - all told, more in two days than it raised in all of January. 
But the money came too late to make a major advertising splash in the Super Tuesday states, and instead Biden was hoping to be carried by momentum and endorsements. 
""The country is hungry - hungry, hungry, hungry - to be united. Most Americans, they don't want a promise of a revolution, they want a guarantee of results,"" Biden said earlier in the day during a campaign stop in Houston. "". . . We need real results, and we need them now. I've done that my whole career.""
On CBS on Monday morning, Biden said his surge in support occurred in part because candidates down the ballot are wary of running with Sanders as the Democratic standard-bearer.
""I think there's an awful lot of people who are running for office who don't want to run with Bernie at the top of the ticket as a self-proclaimed socialist,"" he said.

The party's donor class also began to rally to Biden's side. 
A handful of key Democratic donors who were raising big checks for Buttigieg or considering publicly endorsing Bloomberg said they were throwing their support to Biden on Monday - and were persuading others to do so, too. 
On Monday, a longtime Obama donor in Northern California who had given to multiple candidates during the primaries sent emails urging party donors waffling between Bloomberg and Biden to coalesce around Biden. And on Wall Street, Buttigieg donors were calling one another to say Biden was the best alternative, barring a Bloomberg upset Tuesday.
One longtime Democratic donor in New York, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, said there were meetings scheduled with major Wall Street financiers starting Sunday through Wednesday, out of anxiety about Buttigieg's fourth-place finish in South Carolina and concern over his chances on Super Tuesday. 
Klobuchar's early exit means that her home state of Minnesota, which has 75 delegates at stake in its primary, is up for grabs Tuesday. Sanders won the state when it held caucuses in 2016 and had closely trailed Klobuchar in recent polls. He held a rally in Minneapolis on Monday night. 
Klobuchar's decision came after she finished near the bottom in the South Carolina primary Saturday. The senator had briefly surged in some polls after a strong performance at the Feb. 7 Democratic debate in Manchester, N.H. Her campaign had dubbed the boost ""Klomentum"" and hoped it would catapult her into the top tier of candidates through the rest of the early-nominating states.
Klobuchar finished in third place in the New Hampshire primary, but a disappointing sixth place in the Nevada caucuses and in South Carolina. She had planned an aggressive travel schedule in advance of Super Tuesday but dropped out before she could execute it.

President Trump on Friday endorsed a tweet comparing the top Senate Democrat to Iran, the United States' longtime adversary, suggesting neither could be trusted, as Democratic leaders criticized the White House for ordering a military strike to kill a powerful Iranian commander without congressional input.
Amid a flurry of reactions from U.S. lawmakers, Trump retweeted conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza, who, in response to a headline about Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) not receiving advance notice of the military operation, wrote: 'Neither were the Iranians, and for pretty much the same reason.'
Trump made similar insinuations about Democrats' trustworthiness after the October raid that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. At that time, Trump said he didn't tell House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), a former member of the Intelligence Committee, because 'he wanted to make sure this kept secret.'
Trump ordered the U.S. drone strike that killed Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani, whom the United States regarded as a war criminal responsible for hundreds of American deaths.
Republicans and Democrats were united in calling Soleimani an enemy of the United States and a terrorist.
'This morning, Iran's master terrorist is dead,' said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in remarks on the Senate floor. 'The architect and chief engineer for the world's most active state sponsor of terrorism has been removed from the battlefield at the hand of the United States military.'
Schumer called Soleimani a 'notorious terrorist,' and added: 'No one should shed a tear over his death.'
But as Republicans celebrated what they described as Trump's decisive action, Democrats criticized the president's order to act unilaterally while expressing grave concern that this action would move the United States closer to an in trac table war with Iran. 
'No matter how good it may feel that Qasem Soleimani is no longer alive, he likely will end up being more dangerous to the United States, our troops and our allies, as a martyr than as a living, breathing military adversary,' said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.).
Trump, in brief remarks Friday afternoon about the attack, said he targeted Soleimani to 'stop a war,' not to start one.
Presidents typically inform the so-called Gang of Eight "" the House speaker and minority leader, the Senate majority and minority leaders, and the chairmen and ranking minority-party members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees "" about high-level military operations.
Top Democratic leaders in Congress received no advance notification of the strike, aides said. Pelosi spoke to Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper after the attack for about 13 minutes, said an aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak publicly.
'I'm a member of the Gang of Eight, which is typically briefed in advance of operations of this level of significance. We were not,' Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor, adding that the administration must be 'asked probing questions not from your inner and often insulated circle, but from others, particularly Congress, which forces an administration before it acts to answer very serious questions.'
It was unclear which congressional leaders were given advance notice of the strike. 
McConnell said only that he had spoken to the defense secretary and was arranging a classified briefing for all senators early next week, but he provided no details on when he first learned about the strike.
Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a Trump ally, said Friday morning on Fox News that he was 'briefed about the potential operation when I was down in Florida' and appreciated 'being brought into the orbit.'
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) posted a photo on Instagram of himself and Trump at the president's Mar-a-Lago estate late Thursday, though it was not clear whether he, too, was briefed ahead of time.
McCarthy praised the killing of Soleimani as a 'statement to those seeking to attack America.' Trump, McCarthy said, had responded appropriately to violence by Iranian-backed groups in Iraq, including an attempt to storm the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
'In a display of resolve and strength, we struck the leader of those attacking our sovereign U.S. territories,' he said. 
Most Democrats focused their ire on Trump's unilateral action that they said could propel America into another conflict in the Middle East, yet Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) directed a more personal blow at Trump. 
'The Occupant was JUST impeached for abuse of power for political gain - now he is leading us to the brink of war because he believes it will help his re-election. We are sick of endless wars. Congress has the sole authority to declare war and we must deescalate. #NoWarWithIran,' Pressley tweeted.
Many of Trump's possible Democratic opponents in the presidential election also offered stern rebukes of Trump's handling of foreign policy. 
Calling the strike against Soleimani an assassination, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted that the United States was 'on the brink of yet another war in the Middle East.' She added: 'We're here because a reckless president, his allies, and his administration have spent years pushing us here.'
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called it a 'dangerous escalation,' and former vice president Joe Biden said in a statement that Trump 'just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox.'
In New Hampshire, Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, who was an intelligence officer in Afghanistan, echoed many congressional Democrats who have wondered what the strategy is now. 'If we have learned nothing else from the Middle East, in the last 20 years, it's that taking out a bad guy is not a good idea unless you're ready for what comes next,' Buttigieg said. 
In Iowa, Sanders condemned Trump's action and emphasized his long record of opposing many U.S. military interventions abroad, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq. 
 'It gives me no pleasure to tell you at this moment we face a similar crossroads fraught with danger,' he said, adding that Trump's decision 'now puts us on the path to another war, potentially one that could be even worse than before.'

Leader quells budding revolt in ranks
Both sides take Senate floor to press issue of fairness
The first substantive day of President Trump's impeachment trial opened Tuesday with unexpected internal GOP dissension over its structure, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was forced to revise his proposed rules at the last minute to accommodate a brewing rebellion in his ranks.
Under the updated guidelines, both sides will receive more time to present their cases, and findings from the House impeachment probe will automatically be entered into evidence as part of the trial.
The concerns over the rules underscored the narrowness of the majority that McConnell will have to tend to as Trump's impeachment trial proceeds, while also balancing the demands of a White House that has repeatedly pushed for a swift acquittal of the president.
The Republican dispute unfolded as the House impeachment managers and the president's legal team took to the floor of the Senate chamber to lay out their cases on the two charges against Trump: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress related to his alleged attempts to pressure Ukraine to dig up dirt on a political rival.
Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told senators that the most important question confronting them was whether to accept a structure that Democrats said would not produce a fair trial as he argued for Trump's removal from office.
'If the House cannot call witnesses or introduce documents and evidence, it's not a fair trial,' Schiff said. 'It's not really a trial at all.'
In response, the president's lead lawyers also pressed the issue of fairness, arguing that House Democrats had rushed through a process that deprived Trump of his due process rights and that Trump should not have been impeached at all.
'A partisan impeachment is like stealing an election. And that's exactly what we have,' White House Counsel Pat Cipollone said. 'Talk about the framers' worst nightmare. It's a partisan impeachment that they delivered to your doorstep in an election year.'
Two points in McConnell's initial resolution that established how the trial would be run drew concern from several Republicans: a provision that would have compressed 24-hours of opening arguments into two days for each side, and language that would not automatically admit evidence from the House impeachment probe unless there were a formal vote to include it. In a closed-door party lunch before the trial day began Tuesday afternoon, a number of Republican senators protested those portions of the resolution, according to multiple officials familiar with the meeting.
GOP senators who raised questions about the evidence issue were concerned that it would give Democrats easy ammunition to portray Republicans as being unfair, according to two of the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the senators' sentiments. Many Republicans were also upset that pushing 24-hours of opening arguments into two days for each side "" a restriction that was not included in the rules for President Bill Clinton's trial in 1999 "" would give the appearance that the GOP was rushing the trial.
Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) said Republicans thought that 'if we did try to rush it or compress it, that that might not be the best thing to do.'
One of the senators most upset about the initial provisions was Susan Collins (R-Maine), who will be a key swing vote on procedural matters during the trial. But the concerns spread beyond a closely watched core of potential GOP swing senators, with Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) also among those voicing objections in the closed-door lunch about the two-day timetable. That provision didn't please Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), either. One Republican official with direct knowledge of the discussion described it as 'lots of dissension and chaos.'
Democrats seized on the changes as proof that a small clutch of GOP senators facing public opposition to any component of the highly contentious trial could force McConnell to reverse course, though the Republican leader was expected to win all 53 GOP votes in favor of his measure by the end.
'The public realizes how unfair the McConnell proposal is, and the pressure that we have put on them and on Republican senators has gotten them to change,' Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters. 'There are still many other things that are unfair, particularly in relationship to witnesses, particularly in relationship to documents.'
Now, both the Democratic impeachment managers and Trump's defense team will have up to three days each to make their case, and evidence from the House will be entered automatically unless there is an objection. 
The White House had initially requested condensing the opening arguments into two days for each side, according to several people familiar with the drafting. One senior administration official said it had done so while cautioning that the language could change depending on the needs of Trump and various senators, and that the number of days for opening arguments was a lower priority for the White House.
On other issues, Republicans killed attempts from Democrats to modify the parameters of the proceedings to allow for an assortment of documents and a slate of witnesses at the outset.
In a sign of fatigue, at least on the GOP side, McConnell (R-Ky.) halted the trial proceedings shortly before 9:30 p.m. in a bid to negotiate an end to the hours-long debate that seemed destined to go on for much longer. But after a brief recess that allowed for senators to talk, the two sides did not reach a deal to speed things up. 

'There will be a good number of votes,' Schumer said. 'We are willing to do some of those votes tomorrow. There is not reason we have to do them all tonight and inconvenience the Senate and the chief justice. But we will not back off on getting votes on all of these amendments, which we regard as extremely significant and important to the country.'
Earlier in the debate, Schumer and Senate Democrats forced an attempt to subpoena documents kept by the White House "" including the National Security Council "" as well as separate efforts to obtain records from the State Department, the Pentagon and the Office of Management and Budget. Democrats also pushed to summon acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and other administration witnesses that Democrats had demanded for weeks. All were rejected on party-line votes.
Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), one of the seven House impeachment managers, argued that the White House was sitting on hundreds of pages of relevant materials. She played video of key House witnesses who said they had submitted notes about discrepancies in the rough transcript of Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July-25 that has been at the heart of the case against the president "" as well as a core part of his defense.
'Attorney-client privilege cannot shield information about misconduct,' Lofgren said.
Trump was impeached Dec.-18 by the House on charges that he held up nearly $400-million of congressionally appropriated aid to Ukraine and a coveted White House visit for Zelensky as a condition for the Eastern European nation launching an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden "" a potential 2020 rival for the White House "" and his son Hunter.
The president's attorneys have argued that the requests from Trump were related to his concerns about corruption. Hunter Biden had served on the board of Burisma, Ukraine's largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment, although Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing.
Amid the vigorous debate about his Ukraine dealings, Trump was in Davos, Switzerland, meeting with other global leaders and touting U.S. economic prosperity at the World Economic Forum. In brief remarks to reporters in Davos, Trump dismissed his impeachment as a 'hoax.'
'It goes nowhere because nothing happened. The only thing we've done is a great job,' Trump said. 'That whole thing is a total hoax, so I'm sure it's going to work out fine.'
About 45 minutes after the Senate trial began, Trump tweeted: 'READ THE TRANSCRIPTS!' "" part of his persistent argument that the record of his call with Zelensky absolves him of wrongdoing.
Through the hours of arguments, all 100 senators sat silent at their desks, barred from their smartphones and with many of them taking prodigious notes. Among the members of the public that were spotted in the half-full galleries in the Senate chamber were former senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and actress and activist Alyssa Milano.
At one point, Cipollone sought to focus attention on four senators who are seeking the Democratic presidential nomination but who must be in attendance at the trial, saying that 'some of you are upset because you should be in Iowa right now.' Several senators cast glances toward one of those candidates, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who was watching Cipollone's remarks with his elbows on the arms of his chair, hands folded in front of his face.
Both Cipollone and Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's outside attorneys, relayed inaccurate statements during the trial.
Sekulow claimed that the White House was not allowed to have a lawyer present during the impeachment hearings spearheaded by the House Judiciary Committee; the White House was allowed to participate but declined to do so. Cipollone also falsely argued that House Republicans had no access to the secure facilities where closed-door depositions of key House witnesses were taken late last year.

WAUKEE, Iowa "" Sen. Amy Klobuchar's political hero is Paul Wellstone.-Her campaign bus is green because his campaign bus was green, for example. When Wellstone was facing a tough fight in Minnesota to keep his Senate seat in 2002 after voting against the Iraq War, Klobuchar was unopposed for reelection as the district attorney for the county that includes Minneapolis. That allowed her to travel around the state with him. You probably remember that Wellstone died in a plane crash weeks before the election, but he was also diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in that final year of his life.
'He would always run back and forth in parades, but that last year of his life he couldn't run anymore because of the MS,' Klobuchar recalled during a town hall meeting here on Sunday night. 'He would just stand on the back of his bus and wave. Here's the amazing thing: He had energized so many people in those green shirts to run around that bus, hundreds of people, that you didn't even notice that he wasn't running himself. That's what I'm asking you to do for me.'
Klobuchar asked the crowd of 140 people to do that for her because the senator from Minnesota needed to leave Iowa to serve as a juror in the impeachment trial of President Trump. With some momentum, and an impressive list of endorsements, Klobuchar said she 'would like nothing more' than to keep barnstorming the state. 'But it is my lot in life,' she said.
All four of the senators still seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination scrambled over the three-day holiday weekend to talk with as many voters as possible. They each campaigned in Iowa on Monday before flying to Washington, where they're required to be for the impeachment trial that began in earnest on Tuesday.
The 100 senators won't be sequestered in a hotel for this jury duty, but they'll be functionally stranded in the capital six days a week "" they get Sundays off "" until, potentially, even beyond the Iowa caucuses on Feb.-3.
'I'm going to be stuck in Washington for God knows how long so we need you to take my place,' Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont told 750 supporters on Monday night in Des Moines.
While the senator sits in judgment of Trump in Washington, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) will headline campaign events on Sanders's behalf later in the week.

It's undeniably terrible timing for jury duty, and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wouldn't excuse the senators running for president, even if they asked. To be sure, none of the four would dream of making such a request. They all insist that their day jobs, and sworn oaths, are their top priorities.-
'There are things that are more important than politics,' Sen. Elizabeth Warren initially said when asked about impeachment on Sunday afternoon in Des Moines, repeating a talking point she has used for weeks. When asked again, after finishing her 106th town hall in Iowa, the senator from Massachusetts mused about how her time on the ground here has 'changed' her, saying she'll miss fielding questions from everyday people.
'I'll also miss the babies and the pinkie promises,' Warren said. 'I really have loved this part of the campaign. And I hope I'll be able to come back more to Iowa. . . . They talk about the issues that matter to them. This is the give-and-take that should really be at the heart of our democracy. It's changed me. And it's really strengthened my faith in what we can do in a democracy.' 
Polls show that impeachment is not top of mind for most caucus-goers. All the Democratic candidates think Trump should be removed, so there's no contrast to highlight. But voters do care, and they are paying attention.-Michael Marcheck, 31, a graduate student who wants to be a social studies teacher, drove from Nebraska to volunteer for Warren. He wore a button at her rally that said 'Merry Impeachmas,' with a picture of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) clapping at Trump during last year's State of the Union address. 'Please let everyone in the East know that we do care about impeachment here in the Midwest,' he said.
Warren's closing argument is that she's the candidate most committed to, and capable of, fighting political 'corruption,' which she says is at the heart of every problem in Washington. She has promised for more than a year to enact the biggest set of ethics overhauls since Watergate, putting extra emphasis on the theme as impeachment came to the fore.
Warren unveiled her latest plan Tuesday morning, pegged to the impeachment trial, to address 'the corruption and incompetence of the Trump administration.'-In it, she says she will ask for the immediate resignations of all Trump political appointees on the day she becomes president, including U.S. attorneys. Warren proposes the establishment of a Justice Department task force with 'independent authority' to 'investigate corruption during the Trump administration and to hold government officials accountable for illegal activity.' 

Klobuchar has perhaps the most to lose in Iowa from the impeachment proceedings.-She needs to garner 15-percent in a precinct to be considered 'viable' enough to receive delegates. Klobuchar is straddling that threshold in the polls, holding fifth place behind Warren, Sanders, Biden and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg.-

Klobuchar is a grinder. During a recent three-day stretch, she visited 27 counties. 'I would love to do 10 counties a day, but I am going to be there,' she said, referring to Washington.

Speaking at an 'innovation center' in an office park, with an icy parking lot and subzero temperatures outside, Klobuchar expressed confidence that she can still campaign while serving as a juror. 'I always tell people that I'm a mom, and I can do two things at once,' she said, adding that her daughter will hold events on Klobuchar's behalf. 'You will enjoy her.'-
Supporters hope Klobuchar can use the national platform to bolster her standing. 'I have mixed feelings about it,' said Klobuchar supporter Margo Marks, 74, of Waukee. 'How much it would help her to be here, I don't know. But I'm glad to have her out there as a juror. She's a great representative who will ask the right questions and hopefully influence people.'
Dan Looker, 72, said after listening to Klobuchar's speech that he will sign up for extra door-knocking shifts over the next two weeks. The retired business editor of Successful Farming magazine, who lives in Des Moines, has viewed Klobuchar as presidential material since she questioned then-Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh about his drinking. 'I'm sure impeachment is an added challenge for her, but anyone who lives in Iowa has seen lots of ads for all the candidates,' he said. 'If she can afford to run ads, I think she'll be okay.'
Sen. Michael F. Bennet of Colorado has mostly focused on New Hampshire, but he was in Iowa on Monday. 
'We all have an important constitutional responsibility to fulfill, and I feel like we've got to make sure we take the time to take it seriously, and we cannot let the campaigning distract us,' Bennet said.



To be sure, being absent from Iowa is not necessarily a death knell.-Consider the inverse: No Democratic candidate has spent more time in the Hawkeye State this cycle than former Maryland congressman John Delaney, who continues to register at zero percent in the polls. 



Shari Hawk, a retired nurse who lives in the suburb of Ankeny, will be a precinct captain for Sanders on caucus night. She has been door-knocking, phone-banking and even was asked to leave a shopping center a few days ago where she was canvassing for Sanders. Hawk told me that she converted a handful of undecided voters. 
'It still bothers me, though, because nobody excites people like Bernie himself does,' said Hawk, 69, of Sanders's forced absence because of the impeachment trial. 'We all know that. But we also know his surrogates can raise the roof.'

Former vice president Joe Biden appears to have regained momentum in Virginia ahead of Tuesday's Democratic presidential primary election, while Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and billionaire Mike Bloomberg have both lost support, a poll released Friday shows.
In the survey by Christopher Newport University's Wason Center for Public Policy, 22 percent of likely Democratic voters said they preferred Biden.
Sanders (I), who has been leading in national polls after successes in Nevada, New Hampshire and Iowa, was second among Virginia voters, with 17 percent.
Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who has saturated Virginia with campaign ads, trailed behind in third place, with 13 percent.
All the other Democratic candidates polled in the single digits - Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg garnered 8 percent support, compared with 5 percent for Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and 1 percent for billionaire activist Tom Steyer. Of the 561 likely Democratic voters surveyed, 13 percent said they're undecided. 
The poll was conducted during a volatile February in which the candidates took swipes at one another. It could give Biden new energy as the candidates head into Saturday's primary election in South Carolina, where the former vice president has staked his hopes for a broader resurgence after disappointing results in primary contests. 
Virginia, where 99 delegates are at stake, is one of 14 states holding Democratic primaries on Super Tuesday.
For both Sanders and Bloomberg, the results show some signs of diminishing support in the state; a Monmouth University poll conducted earlier this month showed them tied at the top of the field, with only 1 in 4 voters certain about their choice. Both candidates have come under intense fire in recent weeks as their opponents seek to gain traction with voters.
Sanders, a democratic socialist who has energized the party's more liberal wing and who held a rally in Richmond on Thursday, is accused of being too divisive, with more moderate Democrats suggesting a November matchup between Sanders and President Trump would be disastrous.
That concern about Sanders in a historically moderate state was reflected in the poll, with 67 percent of respondents saying they are worried that the eventual party nominee might be ""too liberal.""

Bloomberg has been forced to defend himself against resurfaced allegations of mistreatment of women in his company and a stop-and-frisk policy during his mayoral term that targeted African Americans and Latinos.
But a Wason Center analysis released with the poll results said both candidates remain ""in striking range"" of winning in Virginia.
""Although Biden is safely ahead of Bloomberg, he is within the margin of error with Sanders, and Sanders and Bloomberg are within the margin of error from each other,"" the analysis said. The margin of error among likely Democratic voters was plus or minus 4.3 percent.
As several candidates prepare to visit the state and whip up support over the weekend, the poll shows that the fractious nature of the Democratic race so far has turned off many Virginians.
Just 67 percent of likely Democratic primary voters said they would ""definitely"" support the party's nominee in the November election against Trump if their preferred candidate doesn't win, although another 15 percent said they plan to do so. 
At the same time, the poll asked 866 registered voters to choose between Trump, who lost Virginia to Hillary Clinton in 2016, and ""someone else."" Just 38 percent of respondents chose the president.
On the question of ""electability"" for the Democratic nominee, likely Democratic primary voters were evenly split, with 49 percent saying that is most important to them and 48 percent saying the candidates' platforms matter most.
Of all registered voters surveyed, 60 percent said they preferred to ""maintain"" their health insurance instead of adopting a Medicare-for-all plan that Sanders and Warren have advocated. 
Just 9 percent said they wanted the current health-care system to be ""ended promptly,"" while 28 percent said they'd like to see it phased out over time.
Only 15 percent supported canceling student loans for all borrowers, another Sanders initiative. While 38 percent supported reducing loan debt, 32 percent said student loans should be left alone.

NASHUA, N.H. ""
A steady stream of anxious Democratic voters went to the polls in this pivotal state Tuesday saying they'd chosen a candidate only in recent days or even hours, underlining Democrats' deep-seated frustration and uncertainty over how to defeat a president they revile.

Terry Heinzman, walking into a Manchester precinct, surprised herself by voting for former vice president Joe Biden. Just hours earlier, she had been trying to decide between Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).
'I thought it was going to be Amy or Elizabeth,' Heinzman said as she put on an 'I voted' sticker. But as the retired event planner, 74, entered her polling place at the McDonough School, she decided that reversing what she saw as the calamitous damage of the Trump era required a more experienced hand. 
'As much as I am progressive, in my values and the way I think this country ought to go, I don't think it's time right now,' Heinzman said. 'I think there's so much cleaning up to do.' Yet, asked whether Biden could beat Trump, she said, 'I'm not sure anybody can, to be perfectly honest with you.' 
That fatalism was widespread among voters in the first-in-the-nation primary, even after a year of campaign by a Democratic field that at one point included more than two dozen contenders. Linda Ryan, a 62-year-old teacher who voted in Nashua, also agonized until the 11th hour, saying, 'I didn't decide until yesterday.' 
Ryan had been torn between Klobuchar and Buttigieg, finally choosing the former because 'I just think she's more electable.'
New Hampshire has played an outsize role in shaping previous presidential primaries, but Democrats fretted that the outcome this year would provide little clarity. The New Hampshire primary came a week after the botched Iowa caucuses that produced a delayed, muddled result.
'The truth of the matter is, tonight is likely going to raise more questions than answers,' said Karine Jean-Pierre, a Democratic strategist and senior adviser at MoveOn.org. 'After tonight, less than 600,000 people will have voted. More than twice that many people will ride the New York City subway home tonight.'

Some campaigns also suggested the muddle was likely to continue. Warren campaign manager Roger Lau wrote to supporters Tuesday, 'No candidate has come close yet to receiving majority support among the Democratic primary electorate, and there is no candidate that has yet shown the ability to consolidate support.'
For his part, Biden "" who led the national polls for much of the past year "" planned to leave New Hampshire early to head to South Carolina, a reflection of his poor prospects in the Granite State, where Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) led the latest polls. Before departing, Biden pronounced himself 'mildly hopeful' about New Hampshire "" a slight improvement over an earlier assertion that he would 'probably take a hit' there "" and signaled his hope for a rebound in South Carolina. 
Still, voters in New Hampshire grappled with their decision, saying Democrats across the country were looking to their state for guidance after the Feb.-3 Iowa caucuses were plagued by technical difficulties. In the end, both Sanders and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg declared victory in Iowa.
The turbulence led to a highly unusual inability by voters Tuesday to choose candidates until they absolutely had to. Preliminary exit polls suggested that nearly half of voters made their decisions in the past few days. That is considerably higher than the 36-percent of Iowa Democrats who made their decisions in the days before last week's caucuses. 
It's also roughly double the percentage of New Hampshire voters who decided in the days before the 2016 primary, a contest that had been effectively narrowed to Sanders and Hillary Clinton. 
 The exit poll, conducted by Edison Media Research for the National Election Pool, The Washington Post and other media organizations, only underscored how undefined and unpredictable the Democratic race has been. 

Donald Sanborn, who voted Tuesday in Merrimack, had been undecided between Buttigieg and Klobuchar, both seen as more-moderate alternatives to Sanders. He ended up choosing Klobuchar because he was impressed by her performance at a recent debate. 'She was just so calm and knowledgeable,' he said.
Brian Murphy, 47, who voted for Warren in Portsmouth, said that while he was excited by several of the candidates, he longed for one who combined several of their qualities. 'I wish we could build them all into one giant candidate that can beat the beast,' Murphy said, meaning Trump. 
The president, who was in New Hampshire on Monday for a rally, presents a formidable challenge for Democrats in part because his party is unified behind him while the Democratic field remains fractured. In New Hampshire's Republican primary, Trump faced only nominal opposition from former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld.
Democratic activists and officials were also shaken by the turnout in Iowa, which had fallen below their expectations, raising questions about whether the party's candidates had sufficiently energized the electorate. 
'The turnout in Iowa should have every Democrat concerned "" it was a disaster,' said Jean-Pierre. 'We will not beat Trump unless we get turnout up.'
Sanders, who boasts of his ability to attract new voters to his presidential run, acknowledged Tuesday that turnout in Iowa had not been as high as he wanted but cited an increase in the number of young voters as an encouraging sign. He touted the 7,500 attendees at his Monday-night rally in Durham, tweeting that it was it 'the largest New Hampshire rally of any candidate in this primary.'

One presidential hopeful who was not on the ballot in New Hampshire also loomed large Tuesday: former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg. 
The billionaire candidate has spent more than $300-million on his campaign, targeting states where voting is to take place beginning next month. By skipping the early states, while dominating television ad spending in places where other Democrats have not yet focused, Bloomberg has disrupted the usual nominating process.
At least a few New Hampshire voters opted to side with Bloomberg even though he was not on the ballot. Bloomberg received three write-in votes in the small community of Dixville Notch, whose five residents cast their votes just after midnight Tuesday in a long-standing tradition.
Bloomberg's rise in the polls has sparked increasing attacks from other candidates, who have been highlighting his record spending. 'I don't begrudge his wealth, but I do begrudge a billionaire thinking he can buy the election,' Sanders said in an interview with 'NBC Nightly News.'
But even the impassioned messages of candidates such as Sanders left large numbers of Democrats undecided when they arrived at their polling places Tuesday.
Tom Cerone said he was torn between Buttigieg and Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) until he got to the school in Merrimack where he was to cast his vote.
'I was gonna do Bennet,' Cerone said. 'And then I said, 'You know, he's so low in the polls, let me get to Pete.' '

Runners-up in primary for Cummings's seat will vie for full term in April

Kweisi Mfume won a decisive victory in Tuesday's primary election in Maryland's 7th Congressional District.
But the two female candidates who finished second and third say they are not giving up their quest to succeed the late congressman Elijah E. Cummings. Each has nearly three months to convince Democratic voters they deserve a full term in the Baltimore-area seat.
Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, a former state party chair and the congressman's widow, and state Sen. Jill P. Carter (Baltimore City), a former public defender, face an uphill battle to overcome Mfume's name recognition and political support that goes back decades, analysts say.
In a district where Democrats outnumber Republicans about 4-to 1, Mfume is poised to serve the remainder of Cummings's term after the April 28 special general election, occupying at least for the rest of the year the seat he held in Congress from 1987 to 1996.
He fielded congratulatory calls Wednesday after winning 43 percent of the vote, according to unofficial returns. Rockeymoore Cummings won 17 percent, and Carter won 16 percent, far ahead of the rest of the field. 
Rockeymoore Cummings and Carter say they'll perform better in the next showdown, the regular primary, which is also on April-28 and is expected to have much higher turnout, with presidential contenders and candidates for Baltimore mayor and city council also on the ballot. 
The question, political observers said, is whether either woman can demystify what will be a long and complicated ballot and surmount voters' knowledge of and "" in some cases, lifelong affinity for "" Mfume.
'For him to wind up winning so comfortably was surprising and speaks to how difficult it will be to change the result between now and April,' said Todd Eberly, a political science professor at St. Mary's College in Maryland. 
Mfume's experience in Congress and leadership at the NAACP, although marred by allegations of workplace harassment, 'really paid off politically,' Eberly said.

Carter and Rockeymoore Cummings are each stressing the need to send a woman from Maryland to Washington, where men have exclusively represented the state in the three years since former senator Barbara A. Mikulski retired and former congresswoman Donna F. Edwards left office, having lost a bid for Mikulski's seat.
They and other primary candidates also argued that Mfume, 71, represents an older generation and that new blood is needed, noting that the average age of Maryland's senators and representatives is 65. Carter is 55, and Rockeymoore Cummings is 49.
Neither of those arguments seemed to sway primary voters, although the next campaign will be longer, with more time to raise money and get the message out. 
With Mfume competing against Republican Kimberly Klacik in the special election, Carter and Rockeymoore Cummings may try to persuade voters to support Mfume for the eight-month term but back them for the two-year term "" a potentially confusing scenario that could further complicate their paths.
'I have a hard time imagining there is going to be that degree of split ticketing,' Eberly said. 'The complexity of it all is going to be somewhat off-putting.' 
But in her speech to supporters Tuesday night, Carter noted that there is precedent for such a feat. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) pulled it off after John Conyers Jr. resigned over sexual harassment allegations. In August 2018, Tlaib won the Democratic nomination to compete for a full term after a rival won the party nomination to serve the final few months of Conyers's term. 
'I just want to say it's not over,' Carter said to chants of 'Jill on the Hill.'

An ardent liberal who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2016 presidential race and backs Medicare-for-all and the Green New Deal, Carter noted she garnered nearly as much of the vote as Rockeymoore Cummings while raising far less campaign cash. 
In a statement Wednesday, she said: 'I know that I have the strongest and most progressive base of all of the candidates running in the April primary, and I believe that I am the best to serve the 7th congressional district in the long term. We . . . need a champion that will move the needle of progress forward instead backward.'
Rockeymoore Cummings, a policy consultant with limited ties to Baltimore who campaigned as the best person to continue her husband's work on Capitol Hill, told supporters Tuesday night that the 'glass ceiling still exists' in the 7th District.
'I want to thank someone who is not here, and that is congressman Elijah Cummings, my beloved husband,' she said. 'We fought together for a long time, and then, of course, he expected me to keep fighting. And get this, I am.'
Rivals have said Mfume benefited Tuesday from a reliable cadre of older African American female voters who associate Mfume with Elijah Cummings, his friend of 42 years. 
In an interview, Mfume said he plans to embark on a 'listening tour' in the next phase of the campaign. In the generation since he left Congress, the district has gotten more racially diverse, which he said he welcomes. 
'Our campaign has been aimed at residents who are black and white, and Latino and Asian, old, young, obviously city, county, straight, gay "" everybody we can touch who's part of the district,' he said. 

In his first stint in Congress, Mfume served on what is now known as the House Committee on Financial Services, but he said he hasn't yet considered where he'd like to serve if he wins in April.
'I believe first thing's first, and once we cross that bridge, I'll give some sincere thought to [committee] assignments,' he said. 
Mfume said he received congratulatory calls and messages from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Maryland's Democratic lawmakers, including House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, Sen. Ben Cardin, Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, Rep. John Sarbanes and Rep. Jamie B. Raskin. Sen. Chris Van Hollen issued a statement in support.
However, lawmakers stopped short of endorsing Mfume, navigating the tricky dance of supporting the party's nominee for the partial term without influencing the outcome of the primary for the full term. 
Democrats are sensitive to weighing in prematurely, aides say, especially after the national party faced criticism for perceived favoritism of Hillary Clinton over Sanders in the 2016 presidential primary.
'Our delegation has been prepared to embrace, welcome, anyone who is the choice of the 7th District,' Raskin said in an interview Wednesday. 'We are excited that there will be someone there to represent hundreds of thousands of people still grieving the loss of Elijah Cummings.'

Fiery debate underscores incentive for candidates to remain in the race


LAS VEGAS "" The final question at Wednesday's candidate debate in Nevada provided a telling summary of the state of the Democratic nomination contest. It's now Bernie Sanders against the field.
The question for the six candidates onstage was straightforward. Should the person who wins the most pledged delegates during the primaries, even if he or she does not have a majority, be nominated at the national convention in Milwaukee to become the party's challenger to President Trump? 
Sanders, alone, said yes. The five other candidates said that, in that scenario, the decision of who becomes the nominee should be left to all the delegates at the convention, including the roughly 770 superdelegates "" the party committee members, lawmakers and other high-ranking Democrats who can only vote if the contest goes to a second ballot.
But if there is agreement that Sanders will lead the delegate race, there is similar agreement that he is not likely to be able to win a majority. If that turns out to be the case, Democrats could he headed for a chaotic national convention, one that could split the party and weaken Democrats in the general election, regardless of who ends up as the nominee.
'What's clear out of [Wednesday] night is, it's hard to see what forces will stop Bernie from becoming the front-runner and just as hard to see how there will be any consolidation into a single candidate to oppose him,' Robby Mook, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign manager in 2016, said Thursday morning.
The dawning realization for many in the party is that what Democrats had envisioned as a jubilant national convention in Milwaukee, ground zero in a critical general-election battleground, has the potential to turn into a pitched battle among multiple candidates and their supporters, each representing dueling ideological wings of the party and convinced that the other side would lose to Trump.
Top campaigns have not only staffed up with delegate experts to guide them through the intricacies of the primaries, but they also have built legal teams preparing to challenge any results that don't go their way, according to interviews with 16 top party officials and strategists.
And in preparation for a contested convention, some campaigns have started to reach out to superdelegates, in an attempt to secure support for a second ballot when they would come into play.

'This is going to go to the convention,' said Melvin Poindexter, a Democratic National Committee member from Massachusetts. 'It's going to be a brokered convention. I just don't see any of the candidates coming in and winning the first ballot. Particularly looking at the number of candidates who are running.'
If anything, Wednesday's debate provided incentive for all the candidates trying to become the alternative to Sanders to stay in the race as long as possible. Party strategists agreed that the poor performance by former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg probably eliminated any hopes that he could easily consolidate the moderate-to-center-left wing of the party in opposition to Sanders.
At the same time, the fiery performance by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who not only hammered Bloomberg but also took on many of the others onstage, could give her the encouragement to see the race through to the end, despite third- and fourth-place finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, respectively. 
Her ability to continue on ultimately will depend on how well she does over the next two weeks and whether she raises enough money to sustain her candidacy. But Wednesday's debate provided a needed jolt. Her presence could affect Sanders's ability to enlarge his coalition.
Warren also took steps to make herself more competitive "" providing tacit approval for the super PAC that has been formed to back her candidacy, effectively contradicting her past comments criticizing groups that take unlimited contributions. And Warren's campaign announced Thursday that it has raised $7-million since last week's New Hampshire primary, setting a new goal to raise another $3-million by Saturday. 
The focus Wednesday night on Bloomberg, and his inability to counter the attacks, proved to be a gift to Sanders. The senator from Vermont did come in for criticism, especially from former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and from Bloomberg, but overall, he avoided the kind of scrutiny and attacks normally aimed at a front-runner.
Still, Sanders left open the question of just how broad his support is or can become. Some strategists saw the debate as potentially pushing Sanders into a narrower ideological corner of the Democratic electorate that could, in time, play to his disadvantage. 
Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg said Sanders's support has come mostly from those who identify themselves as 'very liberal,' a group that constitutes far less than half of the Democratic electorate. 
'Sanders is robustly and self-confidently the most progressive candidate,' Greenberg said. 'The question is, does he have voters beyond the very liberal part of the Democratic electorate?'
All the candidates must get through Saturday's Nevada caucuses, in which Sanders is favored, and the South Carolina primary a week later, an event that is critical to the candidacy of former vice president Joe Biden. 
But the real focus now is on what follows three days after South Carolina, which is Super Tuesday and the beginning of a nationalized campaign for delegates. Sanders is seen as best positioned to do well because he has the money, organization and experience to navigate through a nationalized campaign.
The arcane process that Democrats use to pick nominees puts a premium on candidates who have broad support to win statewide contests, which award a portion of the delegates, and also win individual congressional districts, which account for the rest of the delegates. The process also benefits campaigns that can pinpoint the areas where they can either win a few extra delegates "" or potentially deny an opponent from doing so.
Because there are no winner-take-all contests, delegates are awarded proportionally to any candidate who hits a threshold of 15 percent of the vote. In a field in which there are several candidates competing and reaching that threshold, it becomes difficult for anyone to reach a majority by the end of the primaries. But those same rules give a big advantage to the candidate who gains even a modest lead. For those running behind, making up that ground becomes more and more difficult.

The Las Vegas debate was more evidence that this nominating contest is not like others, in which candidates quickly fall away after poor finishes in early states. At almost every stage so far, events have conspired to keep the field large and fluid. That helps Sanders for now but means the other candidates probably will seek ways to win delegates and stay in the race until the convention.
'I don't see how this is not going to be a brokered convention,' said Nathan Smith, a DNC member from Kentucky. 'Let's be honest: It's a made-for-TV event now.'
Pledged delegates are supposed to vote on the first ballot for the candidate who won in their state or district. But they are freed up on the second ballot to do as they wish, and at that point, the superdelegates are also able to vote for whichever candidate they choose.
'I don't think it's going to be a chair-throwing fiasco,' said Grace Carrington, a committee member from Florida. 'But we know there's going to be a second, maybe a third vote.'
Party leaders worry they could be heading toward a convention collision. 
'I fear divisions within the party might be our biggest problem,' said Cynthia Busch, a committee member from Florida, who was a Sanders delegate in 2016 and is currently uncommitted. 
Wendy Davis, a committee member from Georgia, said she would urge everyone to remain positive and not fall into needless conflict. 
'I'm very troubled that we're setting up for a circular firing squad,' she said.
Sheikh Rahman, a committee member from Georgia, said he has heard from the Buttigieg, Biden and Sanders campaigns recently but is making no commitments. If it comes to a contested convention, he plans to survey scores of state committee members to help him determine which candidate to support at the convention.
'I'm trying to stay on the sideline at the moment and see what happens,' he said. 'I'm just taking the safe route.'
Former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe, also a former DNC chair, predicted that any candidate who enters the convention with a large plurality would win the nomination. 'If it's close,' he added, 'that's a different reality.' 
Rahm Emanuel, the former mayor of Chicago, warned that the convention could descend into chaos unless steps are taken soon to assure that those in charge in Milwaukee are experts on the rules and with personalities and stature strong enough to wield a gavel effectively.
'The chair of the convention is not for the fainthearted,' he said. '[DNC Chair Tom] Perez had better organize it, because you're going to need it. There's going to be a fight. The chairman of the party better have a war room for the convention.'

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), on the strength of his performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, has surged nationally and now holds a sizable lead over all his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll.
Former vice president Joe Biden, who led Sanders in a Post-ABC national poll in January, has seen a sharp drop in his support after finishing fourth in the Iowa caucuses and fifth in the New Hampshire primary. Biden is now in a battle for second place with former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).

Former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, who won the state-delegate-count battle in the Iowa caucuses and came a close second to Sanders in New Hampshire, is in single digits nationally, roughly even with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), whose surprise third-place finish in New Hampshire further scrambled the Democratic contest.

The poll underscores how quickly support for candidates can change in national polls on the strength of results from individual primaries and caucuses. The findings came on the day of a Democratic debate in Las Vegas that was to include Bloomberg on the stage for the first time and represented a high-stakes gamble for all the candidates.
The poll also comes just days ahead of the third contest on the calendar, Saturday's Nevada caucuses, with the South Carolina primary to follow on Feb.-29. After South Carolina, the campaign goes national, with 14-states holding contests on March-3, Super Tuesday, and crucial primaries in a variety of big states later in the month. 
On the basis of the new national poll, Sanders appears well-positioned to accumulate delegates in those states and, possibly, emerge by the end of March with a delegate advantage over his rivals. He is aided in his bid to accumulate more delegates by the fractured support among the more moderate candidates in the field. All are jockeying to become the principal rival to the senator representing Vermont, who has a firm hold on the party's liberal wing.

The Post-ABC poll shows Sanders, who got more votes in Iowa than any other candidate ahead of his narrow win in New Hampshire, with the support of 32-percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning registered voters. That is an increase of nine percentage points since January. He holds double-digit leads among both women and men, as well as among those who say they are certain to vote in their state's primary or caucuses.
Biden, who was at 32-percent support in January, has fallen to 16-percent in the new survey. He faces significant hurdles as he attempts to mount a comeback, with his hopes pinned on success in Nevada and especially South Carolina, where he had long been the favorite of African American voters who make up a hefty majority of the Democratic electorate there.
Bloomberg, who is skipping the first four states but has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into television ads in states with primaries in March, stands at 14-percent, up from 8-percent in January. He has only recently begun to receive significant criticism from the other candidates, how ever.
Warren saw no change in her national support, remaining at 12-percent. Buttigieg, despite his strong performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, runs fifth nationally at 8-percent, ticking up from 5-percent a month ago. Klobuchar stands at 7-percent in the new national poll, up from 3-percent. Buttigieg and Klobuchar face a similar challenge, which is to appeal to a broader coalition of voters in the coming two early-state contests.
Biden's poor finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire appear to have robbed him of his image as the most electable against President Trump in November "" the chief attribute he has used to define his campaign. 
By a wide margin, 58-percent to 38-percent, Democrats say they would rather nominate a candidate who can defeat Trump than one who agrees with them on major issues. 
Electability is a subjective judgment, however, and the former vice president is paying the price for his failure to draw more significant backing from voters in the first two states. A month ago, 38-percent of Democratic-leaning adults cited Biden when asked which candidate has the best chance to defeat Trump, making him their top choice in that regard. Today that has dropped by half, to 19-percent. 
In the new poll, Sanders is seen as the most electable, cited by 30-percent of Democratic leaners as best situated to beat Trump. Bloomberg is cited by 18-percent on this question, with no other Democrat close to double digits.

In the past month, Biden has lost support among three key constituency groups: African Americans, older voters and whites without college degrees, previously the bulwarks of his campaign. In a Post-Ipsos poll this year, Biden was backed by 48-percent of African American voters. Today that has fallen to 31-percent. Compared with January's Post-ABC poll, his support has been cut nearly in half among voters over age 50 and stands at 20-percent; among non-college whites, support for Biden plummeted from 33-percent to 11-percent.
Sanders has seen a big jump in support among voters under 50 and is now backed by 50-percent of that group, up from 34-percent in January. He holds a 3-to-1 lead over his rivals among these voters. Sanders also has more than doubled his support among black voters and has gained among whites without college degrees.
Bloomberg's growth was fueled by more support among older voters and among white voters with college degrees. Buttigieg, Warren and Klobuchar saw no significant shifts in their coalitions.

Many establishment Democrats fear that Sanders, a democratic socialist, would be considered too far left to win a general election and that he could cost Democratic candidates for House or Senate their elections if he were at the top of the ticket.
Democrats nationally appear to be much less concerned about Sanders's ideological stances than voters in New Hampshire's Democratic primary last week. In a New Hampshire exit poll, 50-percent of Democratic primary voters said Sanders's positions on the issues were 'too liberal,' an opinion shared by only 17-percent of Democratic-leaning adults in the national Post-ABC poll.
In the Post-ABC poll, 62-percent of Democratic-leaning adults say Sanders is 'about right' ideologically, almost 20-points higher than the share who said the same in the New Hampshire exit poll. Comfort with Sanders's positions is roughly on par with Biden's (63-percent), Warren's (63-percent) and Buttigieg's (60-percent).
In a measure of how Democrats see Sanders as a candidate against Trump, 72-percent say they believe he would defeat the president. Among Democrats, 69-percent think Bloomberg would win against Trump, and 68-percent say that of Biden. Perceptions of Warren and Buttigieg as general-election candidates are also positive but not as strong as the others. Democrats are roughly split on whether Klobuchar or Trump would prevail in a hypothetical matchup.
If Sanders were to become the nominee, about half of all Americans say it makes no difference in their vote that he is a socialist, including about 7-in-10 Democrats. But nearly 4-in-10 adults say that fact makes them more likely to oppose him, including 37-percent of independents and 79-percent of Republicans. Just under 1-in-10 adults say it makes them more likely to support him. Views of Sanders's identification as a democratic socialist are slightly less negative.
The president's approval rating stands at 43-percent, with 53-percent disapproving, showing no real change in the past month. His approval on handling the economy remains net positive, with 52-percent saying they approve of the job he is doing and 40-percent disapproving. Last month, 56-percent gave him a positive rating.
Looking ahead to November, the poll tested six Democrats in hypothetical general-election matchups. Biden, Sanders and Bloomberg fare best, edging Trump by five to seven points, with Trump receiving 45-percent support against each. Buttigieg, Klobuchar and Warren are within the margin of error of Trump in these measures. Across all matchups, Trump is in a similar position as January, but better off than last October. 
The Post-ABC poll was conducted by telephone from Feb.-14-17 among a random national sample of 1,066 adults, 65-percent of whom were reached on cellphones and 35-percent on landlines. Overall results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5-percentage points; the error margin is four points among the sample of 913 registered voters and six points among the sample of 408 Democrats and Democratic-leaning registered voters.

Pro-Trump super PAC
defends message aimed
at African Americans
Former president Barack Obama on Wednesday called on South Carolina television stations to stop running an ad from a super PAC supporting President Trump that uses Obama's words out of context in a misleading attack on former vice president Joe Biden.
The Committee to Defend the President, a pro-Trump group, circulated an ad that falsely suggests that words Obama spoke in the narration of his own 1995 book were meant to describe Biden.
The group, which placed a similar amount of anti-Biden advertising in Nevada earlier this month, reported to the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday spending more than $250,000 in South Carolina to oppose Biden.
'This despicable ad is straight out of the Republican disinformation playbook, and it's clearly designed to suppress turnout among minority voters in South Carolina by taking President Obama's voice out of context and twisting his words to mislead viewers,' Katie Hill, Obama's communications director, said in a statement. 'In the interest of truth in advertising, we are calling on TV stations to take this ad down and stop playing into the hands of bad actors who seek to sow division and confusion among the electorate.'
Hill said Obama has 'several friends' in the Democratic presidential primary, 'including, of course, his own esteemed Vice President.' She also said Obama has 'no plans to endorse in the primary.'
Late Wednesday, Patchen M. Haggerty, an attorney representing Obama, wrote the pro-Trump group's executive director, Chad Banghart, to say the ad's unauthorized use of Obama's 'name, image, likeness, voice and book passage is clearly intended to mislead the target audience of the ad into believing that the passage from the audiobook is a statement that was made by President Obama during his presidency.' 
The letter demanded that the group 'immediately remove' the ad from public view.
An attempt to sway black voters in the state, the ad begins with a narrator saying 'Joe Biden promised to help our community. It was a lie. Here's President Obama.'
The ad then runs audio of Obama reading an unrelated passage from his book, 'Dreams from My Father,' about a conversation he had with a barber in Chicago when he was a community organizer.
The Obama passage, which describes the mistreatment of black voters by politicians, refers to complaints about 'plantation politics' and the history in Chicago of Democratic politicians expecting black votes despite poor housing, poor job opportunities and police brutality.
The ad repurposes a similar attack the Committee to Defend the President ran last year in several states with many black politicians, including Georgia, Michigan and Louisiana, according to PolitiFact. Similar tactics, aimed at decreasing black turnout for Democrats, were used in a radio ad by another pro-Trump super PAC, Great America Alliance, in the 2017 special House election in Georgia.
'Donald Trump and his allies are absolutely terrified that Joe Biden will defeat him in November. Trump even got himself impeached by trying to force another country to lie about the vice president,' said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign. 'This latest intervention in the Democratic primary is one of the most desperate yet, a despicable torrent of misinformation by the president's lackeys.'
Separately, Republican activists in South Carolina have boasted about a plan called Operation Chaos to encourage Trump backers to vote for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in Saturday's primary. The South Carolina GOP has canceled the state's Republican primary this year.
The Committee to Defend the President, which grew out of a group called Stop Hillary PAC, traditionally raises its money in increments of $5,000 or less, according to FEC records. The group has reported spending $655,285 on television advertising, $279,800 on voter phone contact, and $144,657 on online voter contact since the beginning of this year.
The group spent about $250,000 on a Spanish-language ad before the Nevada caucuses attacking Obama and Biden on immigration reform.
'They separated families and put children in cages,' the narrator says in that spot, appropriating a Democratic critique of Trump's immigration actions.
Ted Harvey, chairman of the Committee to Defend the President, defended the group's advertising in a statement on Wednesday. 
'It took President Trump to lower black unemployment and create jobs for the African-American community, in addition to passing criminal justice reform,' Harvey said in the statement. 'Joe Biden, on the other hand, is simply giving lip-service for votes. That's the point President Obama made in his book, and we have every right to use his own words "" in his own voice "" in the political forum.'

We know this much already: There will be an election next year. People will spend money, eat food, watch (and play) sports, use phone apps and play video games, and countries around the world will engage in diplomacy "" and conflict. The details of all those things, as always, will be what make the year interesting. To get a jump on the future, we asked Washington Post beat reporters and columnists to think about the big stories, themes and questions that we'll look back on this time next December. Here is Outlook's fourth Year in Preview.
 TV by Steven Zeitchik 
New big streaming services will mean new big hits (and new big bills)
The last few months of 2019 were filled with streaming news. Buckets of it. From the nonstop marketing of Jennifer Aniston in Apple TV Plus's 'The Morning Show' to that ubiquitous Baby Yoda from Disney Plus's 'The Mandalorian,' it seemed like the spigot might never turn off. 
And it won't, not anytime soon. This will be a year of new digital programming "" and new services to deliver it.
Just two weeks into 2020, Comcast will unveil more details about Peacock, its new service with content from across NBC Universal properties, set to launch several months later. The spring will also bring HBO Max, the prestige-branded service with all manner of TV shows and movies from the WarnerMedia empire. Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus, both of which launched in November, will add more content throughout the year, too "" as will Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post).
Viewers will have an ever-wider choice of fresh programming. Want new seasons of fan favorites 'Search Party' and 'The Boondocks'? They'll be on HBO Max. It's the final episodes of 'BoJack Horseman' you crave? Where else but Netflix. Looking for 'The Falcon and the Winter Soldier' to give you a fix between Marvel movies? Disney Plus has you covered.
Finding out when new episodes premiere, let alone whether they're worth watching, will be a task far more complicated than your Twitter feed can keep up with.
All these services know they need to offer some reliable hits to complement the new stuff. That means many popular sitcoms are migrating from Netflix. 'The Office' is headed to Peacock; 'Friends' to HBO Max.
And it will all be expensive. Turns out spending sacks of cash on new shows and movies "" Netflix alone is expected to shell out in excess of $15 billion in 2020 "" isn't easy without ad revenue. Services have to charge, whether that's the $5 a month for Apple TV Plus or the $15 for HBO Max. For consumers, that means piling on to a monthly entertainment bill or making tough choices about what to forgo.
But don't get too despondent. If some of the recent sitcoms you seek are too unwieldy or costly to find on streaming services, there's a suddenly appealing option: traditional television. Many shows, after all, will continue to air in syndication.

 Brexit by Karla Adam 
Britain will leave Europe. And then the negotiations will continue.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, fresh off an election victory, has vowed to 'get Brexit done.' Brexit will probably not be 'done' in 2020, but it will "" finally "" get started.
In January, 3 1/2 years after voting narrowly in favor of Brexit, Britain will officially split from the European Union. Expect a big party and fireworks, but don't expect a big rupture in relations between London and Brussels. The status quo will largely continue as the country enters an 11-month transition period, during which Britain will attempt to negotiate a trade deal with the E.U., its largest trading partner, as well as come to agreements on issues including security and law enforcement. Analysts think this is a crazy tight timetable, especially if Johnson wants to diverge substantially from E.U. rules. If a deal isn't completed by the end of the year, it's possible Johnson could break his pledge and seek to extend the transition period. Alternatively, Britain could crash out of the E.U. without a trade pact, reviving anxieties about an abrupt, chaotic and economically damaging 'no-deal' Brexit. 
One reason it's tricky to predict how Johnson will tack in the upcoming negotiations "" Does Britain stay closely aligned with the E.U.? Or does it tilt toward less regulation, in the spirit of Margaret Thatcher? "" is that the prime minister is hard to pin down politically.
But he could be tempted to keep Britain more in lockstep with the E.U., not least because his whopping majority means he won't be beholden to Euroskeptics in his party anymore. Plus, closer alignment could help with his political problems in Scotland and Northern Ireland: As the reality of Brexit sinks in, nationalist movements could gain momentum outside England, and a closer relationship with the E.U. could help head off those threats.

 Food by Laura Reiley 
You will soon taste meat grown in a lab, not on a farm
Plant-based meat was so 2019. Big Beef st(e)aked out territory, demanding legislation that put this interloper on the defensive, mostly in anticipation of what will surely be the food world's biggest game changer in the year to come: Cell-cultured meat, poultry and seafood products derived from muscle tissue grown in a lab with cells harvested from a living animal. 
It is unclear which U.S. company will be first to market "" chicken and duck from Memphis Meats in Berkeley, Calif., with investors such as Bill Gates, Richard Branson and Tyson Foods; Wagyu beef or chicken nuggets from Just (formerly Hampton Creek), whose investors include Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff, Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund; or bluefin tuna from Finless Foods "" but Barclays analysts say 'alt meat' could in the next decade capture 10 percent of the $1.4 trillion global meat industry.
Much of it hinges on rates of adoption. The numbers of vegans and vegetarians aren't growing much. These new products are geared toward omnivores and 'flexitarians,' but as with genetically modified organisms more than a decade ago, some consumers distrust food that has been tinkered with in a laboratory.
As it happens, that will also be an issue with another trend this coming year: grocery store foods that are gene-edited with CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Romaine and white potatoes that don't brown or bruise, and a gene-edited farmed tilapia that grows quickly, are among the foods improved via tiny DNA snips, essentially accelerating the selection of desirable traits that Gregor Mendel achieved via crossbreeding his peas. Whether consumers will embrace these new foods is unknown. For now, the Food and Drug Administration has proposed overseeing gene-edited animals as drugs, something the meat industry thinks will disadvantage American producers.

Tech by Tony Romm 
Washington will try to lock down Silicon Valley
Very few things unite President Trump and the Democrats vying to take his place in the White House, but both are readying for battle against Big Tech.
 Amazon, Facebook, Google and their Silicon Valley peers could face the first major consequences in the coming year from investigations by state and federal regulators into whether they undermine privacy, mishandle sensitive online content, damage elections or quash competition. 
Amazon is in the crosshairs for the tactics it's used to dominate e-commerce, Facebook for the way it gobbles up users' data (and its corporate rivals) and Google for its dominance of the online ad business. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Attorney General William P. Barr has said the Justice Department plans to wrap up its wide-ranging look at search, social media and online shopping in 2020. That could result in calls for new regulations and potentially punishments "" the most extreme being an attempt to break up one or more companies.
The House Judiciary Committee spent 2019 demanding internal documents from Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google. In 2020, it's expected to issue a report on whether the industry has, in effect, subverted federal antitrust protections. And if Trump loses the White House, the pressure will mount: Democratic contenders, especially Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), have promised to unwind some of the mergers that helped the giants become so big in the first place, such as Facebook's purchases of the photo-sharing app Instagram and the messaging platform WhatsApp.
Internet companies spent $55 million over the first nine months of this year to lobby Washington, and they'll throw more political weight around as the threat grows. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg hinted about a fierce counteroffensive in a talk with employees last summer. 'At the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight,' he said. That fight is about to intensify.

Russia by Will Englund
Putin will press his advantage in the Middle East
If Russian President Vladimir Putin suspects that President Trump has been irretrievably weakened or distracted "" and especially if he thinks Trump will be replaced by a more mainstream alternative "" expect him to redouble his efforts to secure a deeper Russian role in the Middle East while he still has a chance.
Russia has been on a roll in the region, with a winning military intervention in Syria; a strengthening of diplomatic and commercial ties with Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Israel; a mercenary involvement in Libya; and a toe in the waters of the western Mediterranean through joint naval exercises with Algeria. But Moscow's gains have come through craft, stealth and a large measure of luck, rather than through major-power prowess, and the challenge will be to sustain and build on those achievements. 
Potential pitfalls abound. Putin has forged a generally useful working relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but he may have to start fresh in a post-Netanyahu era, depending on Israel's third round of elections in March. Turkey and Saudi Arabia have been receptive to Russian dealmaking, but neither is a client state of Moscow by any measure. And the real key to Russia's Middle Eastern success almost certainly depends on its longtime ally Iran, now shaken by violent protests.
In Syria, the Russian military effort has come with little cost and less pain. The real fighting on the ground on behalf of the government of Bashar al-Assad has been carried out by Iran and its Hezbollah allies. But anti-Hezbollah unrest in Lebanon, anti-Iran unrest in Iraq and upheaval on the streets of Iran itself could significantly alter the calculation.
If Iran stumbles, would Putin be forced to bail out Assad, at the risk of getting ensnared in Syria and sparking disquiet at home? Could he continue to avoid a confrontation with Turkey? Would the Saudis be as friendly with Moscow if they thought Iran was distracted by its own troubles? Will the mood shift unpredictably in Washington?
In 2019, Russia demonstrated its agility in the Middle East. The real test may still lie ahead.

 Sports by Barry Svrluga 
It's finally safe to believe here in the District of Champions
Whatever awaits the rest of the country, not to mention 'official Washington,' in 2020, our little sports town occupies a fundamentally different space than it did just 20 months ago. Then, the default setting was dread. The expectation was not just for a loss, but a loss that would come in the most excruciating manner imaginable. How will I be kicked in the stomach today? 
Now? This is new territory, with pain replaced by possibility. Think about how the following sentences would have sounded in, say, December 2017: 'The Capitals are good. Really good. They might be the best team in hockey. They could definitely win the Stanley Cup.' 'The Nationals should be good. Really good. One more offseason move, and they could be favored for a division championship. If things break right, maybe they could win the World Series.'
Two years ago, that would have seemed outlandish and preposterous. Now, it sounds reasonable. Because it actually happened.
While basketball's Wizards might not be where hockey's Capitals and baseball's Nationals are at the moment "" expecting to contend "" the environment is such that their rebuilding project seems less laborious and more fun. A slow simmer of anger about another losing season is replaced by the joy of finding hope for the future. Plus, the Mystics won the WNBA title in 2019. We know winning basketball here!
It must be noted that the football team exists in a different reality, separate from the rest. It's as if the expectations for Washington sports have been turned around "" with the football team left behind. What awaits that outfit in 2020 "" a new coach, for sure, and perhaps even new leadership above him "" will be monitored closely. But the fans who have fled the football team have other places to land.
There's no way to tell what will happen with Washington sports in the year ahead. What we know, though, is that the reality has finally met the expectations, and that completely alters what we believe is possible.

The Economy by Heather Long 
A fragile boom keeps going and going
Although risks remain, the U.S. economy appears unlikely to fall into a recession in 2020. Another year of decent growth will probably make it easier for even more Americans to find jobs "" and boost President Trump's chances of reelection. And the trade wars that dominated economic discussion in 2019 seem to be over, at least for now. 
Growth is expected to be 1.8 percent next year, according to a closely watched survey of economists. That's far from the boom that Trump promised and slower than this year's pace of about 2.2 percent and last year's rate of 2.9 percent "" but the president and the Federal Reserve may have it in their power to nudge the figure upward.
Trump just reached trade agreements with China, Canada and Mexico. The deals are more modest than what he vowed he could achieve, but they signal that he is hitting pause on his trade battles, a welcome relief for Wall Street investors and many business leaders. Although consumers continue to spend at a healthy clip, companies had dramatically scaled back purchases this year because of the trade uncertainty. If Trump keeps the peace on trade, business spending could resume. 
Economists and investors also expect the Fed to lower rates at least once more in 2020, providing another boost. Three rate cuts by the Fed in 2019 were a major reason the stock market hit record highs and recession fears abated.
Although unemployment is at a 50-year low, the position of the middle class remains precarious. Jobs that pay middle-income wages are increasingly going away, replaced by positions paying over $100,000 or under $30,000. That socially destabilizing phenomenon will be a focus of the presidential race.
Economists, meanwhile, are also keeping a vigilant eye on robots "" because firms typically accelerate the automation of jobs done by temporary and low-skilled workers in the months leading up to a significant downturn.
But the general expectation is that the longest expansion in U.S. history, which began in mid-2009, will last at least one more year.

 Hollywood by Elahe Izadi 
No one will stay canceled for good
We've had a full year of hand-wringing over 'cancel culture,' particularly as it relates to comedians. Shane Gillis, for example, hired and then fired by 'Saturday Night Live' for racist language on podcasts, was denounced on social media by celebrities "" and also defended by famous comedians.
But 2020 may be the year when we learn that no one is canceled forever. 
The controversies will continue, yes. The society-wide reckoning with sexual harassment and assault won't abate. There will be more denounced jokes; comedy, more than most art forms, ages terribly. Norms and tastes rapidly evolve. More performers will come under fire for past or recent statements, jokes, offstage behavior or allegations of sexual misconduct.
'Getting canceled,' though, means suffering professional and personal consequences, not being permanently silenced.
Look at Aziz Ansari, who was embroiled in controversy in 2018 after Babe.net published an anonymous accusation of sexual impropriety (Ansari said that the interaction 'by all indications was completely consensual'). He retreated from the limelight for a while, but then he returned to stand-up, doing small shows to work out material before hitting the road to perform in packed theaters. He even addressed the allegation in an acclaimed Netflix special.
Louis C.K., who admitted to sexual misconduct after the New York Times published allegations from five women, lost his manager, publicist and all of the cultural cachet he had built up in his career. But he had a massive email list pre-scandal, and he can still promote himself to his diehard fans, the ones most likely to have remained as subscribers. C.K. is still performing, and as he announced to his list, he has several club and theater gigs in the United States and abroad in 2020.
Even Bill Cosby, convicted of assault, has found an audience "" albeit behind bars "" eager to listen to him opine.
Corporate entities putting together TV shows and movies will remain skittish about backing performers accused of problematic behavior or ones criticized for offensive material. But there will still be audiences willing to watch.

 THE World by Ishaan Tharoor
Protests won't stop. Neither will government crackdowns.
The motives of the millions who took to the streets in Santiago, La Paz, Algiers and Basra were as varied as their geography. But the demonstrators were united in what has become an epochal display of global discontent, an explosion of popular unrest that capped a decade of angst and anger. When they weren't clamoring for greater freedoms and democracy, protesters were marching against corruption, inequality and state brutality. In their wake, presidents fled, prime ministers resigned and governments fell. 
And the movements that flared in 2019 aren't about to peter out.
 Across Latin America, a creaking social contract seems on the verge of collapse: In Chile, widely viewed as one of South America's most stable societies, weeks of protests against austerity measures compelled the center-right president to shuffle his cabinet and announce reforms. But protesters remain on the streets, demanding a wholesale remaking of the socioeconomic order. Demonstrators in Ecuador, Colombia, Argentina and Haiti echoed the call for economic justice. An uprising in Bolivia chased out a long-ruling leftist president, while autocrats in Venezuela and Nicaragua cling to power despite popular challenges. More polarization, paralysis and violence may follow.
That's all the more on view in the Arab world, where a stunning wave of protests unseated leaders in Algeria, Sudan, Lebanon and Iraq. But an entrenched and often corrupt old guard is desperately trying to stay in control. In Iraq, security forces and pro-Iran militias have killed about 500 people and are preparing for a deeper crackdown. 
Iran hasn't been spared, either. In November, authorities cut off Internet access and killed potentially hundreds to quash protests that erupted after a rise in fuel prices. As Iran's theocratic regime enters its fifth decade, a tanking economy and widespread public anger over political elites' mismanagement and corruption only add to the sense of a brewing existential crisis.
In Hong Kong, a sustained pro-democracy movement remains grimly determined, defying the authoritarian leadership in Beijing and its local proxies. China has no intention of acceding to protesters' demands, though, and 2020 could mark a bloody tipping point for Asia's financial capital.
President Trump, known more for his coziness with autocrats than commitment to democracy struggles abroad, has been conspicuously silent about most of these displays of people power. But only in a few instances "" Hong Kong's American-flag-waving youth come to mind "" are any of these movements explicitly calling for U.S. support. The immediacy of social media still allows us to bear witness and hold repressive governments to account. There will be plenty to watch in the year to come.

@ishaantharoor


The White House by Josh Dawsey
President Trump knows you don't like him. He doesn't care.
President Trump has begun admitting what polls have shown for three years: Many, many people hate him. And he's okay with that.
'You don't like me. You have no choice but to vote for me,' he told Wall Street bankers last month. 'You're … not nice people at all, but you have to vote for me,' he said to a room of Jewish supporters in December. 'You have no choice … you're not going to vote for the wealth tax!' 
It is a rare admission from a politician. But it's key to a campaign strategy built around an awareness that Trump's favorability "" even before he was impeached by the House "" is near record lows and that he won't stop tweeting, offering bombast and insults, saying things that aren't true, or making polarizing decisions. So Trump's advisers are leaning in.
'He's no Mr. Nice Guy,' said the narrator in a $1 million-plus ad that ran during the World Series, highlighting some of the president's accomplishments while admitting that voters might not like him. 'But sometimes it takes a Donald Trump to change Washington.'
The idea is to talk more about his record and less about his personality "" while slashing and burning Democratic opponents. At a briefing with reporters in mid-December, campaign manager Brad Parscale and senior adviser Jared Kushner showed data from 2016 indicating that people who said they disapproved of Trump still voted for him. They said many people don't want to publicly admit that they back Trump, but they ultimately will. Their targets are primarily suburban women and independents.
Essentially, Trump's bet is: If your paycheck is better, and we can make you hate the other candidate, you will vote for the president, even if you find him detestable. 
The campaign expects to send surrogates who are less bombastic, such as Ivanka Trump, into areas where suburban women might be persuaded to vote for him.
Officials point to statistics that cut in the president's favor. For example, a recent Quinnipiac poll showed that 57 percent of voters nationally say they are better off than before Trump's presidency. He regularly scores high marks on the economy, which has continued to improve.
That same poll, though, found Trump losing to Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Mike Bloomberg, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. And his approval ratings are mired below 50 percent.
But to Trump's team, that's no reason for panic: On Election Day in 2016, 61 percent of the country rated Trump unfavorably. Now he's running for a second term.

Gaming by Gene Park 
The newest celebrities will play video games
With $152 billion in revenue expected in 2019, gaming has become the dominant entertainment medium of the past decade. And if gaming is this century's rock-and-roll, its biggest personalities are becoming a new class of rock stars. 
These celebrities are much closer to the irreverence of rock and rap icons than any of the Hollywood guard: They're younger, have little interest in social filters and are mostly unimpressed by the lingering sheen of 20th-century stardom. But they're still causing 'utter destruction' in hotel rooms across the world, like the famous troublemakers who came before them.
Tyler 'Ninja' Blevins, the most visible such star recently, has been at the forefront, with an unprecedented exclusive contract with Microsoft's Mixer streaming platform. Others have followed suit, signing lucrative (and secretive) contracts. PewDiePie, arguably the most powerful person on the Internet, hit two milestones in 2019: becoming the first YouTuber to accumulate 100 million subscribers and marrying his longtime girlfriend, Marzia, in a royal wedding for the meme generation. And Dr. Disrespect, who brings the pomp and panache of pro wrestling to Twitch, just signed a TV deal, another first for a pro gamer.
Besides building careers as gamers, they also share brushes with controversy "" which may have been inevitable, given the challenges of communicating to an always-online, always-posting, always-angry audience. Celebrities have had to watch what they say for generations. But gamers grew up with social media, which often rewards the loudest in the room, no matter what.
All signs point to a messy integration between the populist media darlings of Gen Z and the existing power structure for politically correct pop. Ready or not, this clash of cultures is looming "" and Player One is determined to win the game at any cost.

The Supreme Court by Robert Barnes 
Impeachment will land squarely on the chief justice
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist added the famous Gilbert-and-Sullivan-inspired gold stripes to his black robe long before he wielded the gavel at President Bill Clinton's Senate impeachment trial in 1999.
But he did borrow from the operetta 'Iolanthe' in describing his role at the trial: 'I did nothing in particular, and I did it very well,' he told a television interviewer two years later. 
Now on deck: Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. The man who made judge-as-umpire his credo during his confirmation hearing would be only the third chief justice to preside at a presidential impeachment trial. It would also be the first trial of any kind where the lawyer turned appellate judge has been in charge.
Roberts was a law clerk to Rehnquist and shares with his predecessor the goal "" perhaps only aspirational, probably unobtainable "" of convincing the public that he and his fellow justices are impartial to outcomes and immune to partisan influence and bias.
Although the Supreme Court itself has no formal role in President Trump's impeachment, Trump has, perhaps wishfully, imagined that it might. He tweeted this month: 'Shouldn't even be allowed. Can we go to Supreme Court to stop?' Trump has also asked the court to protect his financial records from prosecutors and members of Congress, separate from impeachment; the justices will review that question in the spring.
But it is the chief justice, usually just one of nine, who by constitutional design plays the lone judicial role in presidential impeachment.
Like Rehnquist, Roberts is a student of history and the Constitution. Rehnquist wrote a book on impeachment; those who've studied the Clinton trial say he was reluctant to make broad rulings that could be overruled by a simple majority of senators. He left it to lawmakers to work out details over motions and witnesses. Roberts, who has chided Trump for suggesting that judges' views are more political bias than studied reasoning, will be looking to preserve his own reputation in a process that by design is more political than legal.

 Politics by Michael SchereR 
The billionaires are coming
Call it influence inflation: Back when Bill Clinton was president, $100,000 was enough to get a political donor invited to sleep over in the Lincoln Bedroom. These days, top political benefactors dole out $100 million or more to elect favored candidates. The amount of money spent on presidential campaigns by independent groups rose from almost $129 million in 2008 to nearly $670 million in 2016, according to the Campaign Finance Institute. And essential functions like collecting and analyzing voter data, voter registration drives and spending on political ads are increasingly funded by America's 607 billionaires, outside the direct control of politicians or parties. (One of the richest, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post, and in the 2018 cycle, donated $10.1 million to a super PAC supporting military veterans running for office, as well as $52,400 to five other federal PACs and campaigns, according to public records.) 
Next year will set new records, reaffirming the return of a gilded age for political money. What Brookings Institution scholar Darrell West calls the 'wealthification' of American politics is changing the players as well as the game. Two Democratic billionaires, Mike Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, are self-funding presidential campaigns to dethrone the billionaire president, Donald Trump (and to replace his Cabinet, the wealthiest in modern history, including billionaire Education Secretary Betsy DeVos). A co-chair of the Republican National Committee, Thomas Hicks Jr., is the son of one of the country's wealthiest families, as is the party's finance chairman, Todd Ricketts, while Linda McMahon, a former head of the Small Business Administration whose husband is a billionaire, chairs the top pro-Trump super PAC.
Polls have shown for years that strong majorities of voters think there is too much money in politics. But that hasn't changed the bottom line: The exceedingly wealthy increasingly fund the political world. You just vote in it.

Many people in both major parties have soured on the presidential primary system. In 2016, the Democratic contest was riven by bitter arguments over whether the Democratic National Committee had put a thumb on the scale for Hillary Clinton in her race against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Meanwhile, Donald Trump's ascent revealed the inability of a major party to prevent a celebrity non-politician from hijacking the system and securing its nomination. (Republicans ultimately made their peace with that outcome.) This year's Democratic primary race has hardly impressed observers as a model of candidate selection, either: It features a multibillionaire who skipped the first four states, the early winnowing of all nonwhite candidates, shouty debates and a failure of the party's moderate wing to settle on one person. ¶ From a historical perspective, the story of presidential primaries has largely been about the rise of voter power and the falling clout of party insiders; both parties still struggle with striking the right balance between those forces. With Super Tuesday looming, Outlook asked a range of politicians, scholars and operatives how they'd reform the presidential primary system. They proposed solutions from changing the calendar to changing the map - and even changing the Constitution to reduce the parties' power to choose
the presidential nominees

Former vice president Joe Biden continued Tuesday night on his trajectory toward the Democratic presidential nomination with wins in Michigan, Mississippi and Missouri.
The wins meant Biden would extend his delegate lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) one week after initially gaining it on Super Tuesday, even as three states voting Tuesday had yet to be called: Idaho, North Dakota and Washington.
Here are some takeaways.
1. The delegate gap widens
We don't yet know the full results, but we can say with confidence that Biden's delegate lead will grow substantially once we get them all. That's because of both the trio of early wins - in states making up 63 percent of the delegates available Tuesday - and the margins of victory.
Michigan and Missouri were very close between Sanders and Hillary Clinton in 2016, but the margins Tuesday were so big that Biden was called the winner in both shortly after polls closed. There was also an outside shot that Sanders would fail to clear the 15 percent threshold for delegates in Mississippi, which would be yet another big setback for him, despite the state's relatively small number of delegates (36).
When you throw all of that on top of the fact that the slow-counting California primary hasn't produced the kind of delegate comeback Sanders was hoping for in the days after Super Tuesday, you start to see a yawning gap in the delegate race. All that remains to be seen now is how much the margin increased.
2. Michigan giveth, and Michigan taketh away
The Wolverine State was Sanders's ticket to the party in 2016, with his shocking upset there - after polls showed him down by double digits - serving notice after Super Tuesday that Democratic voters weren't quite ready to anoint Clinton. On Tuesday, it may have served the opposite function.
One of the more interesting findings in the early exit polls was this: Among voters who decided on their candidate before this month, Sanders took a majority of voters, compared with Biden's 4 in 10. But about half of voters said they decided this month - i.e., after Biden began his comeback with a big win in South Carolina - and they went for Biden more than 2 to 1.
In other words, Sanders was arguably primed to win the Michigan primary just 11 days ago, and then things changed significantly.
It's an especially big win for Biden because he did it statewide and with surging turnout. While 1.2 million people voted in the state in the 2016 Democratic primary, that number was estimated at 1.7 million Tuesday. Part of that could have been that there was no competitive Republican primary. In a state that Democrats badly need to win in the general election after losing it narrowly in 2016, expect Biden to make that part of his pitch: I can get voters to the polls in Michigan, because I just did it.
3. Sanders hits his demographic wall again
It was incumbent upon Sanders at the start of this race to build on his 2016 coalition - or hope for the crowded race to last longer. But now that the field is down to two candidates, two very familiar and potentially fatal problems remain for Sanders.
The first is his performance among black voters. His inability to win them over in 2016 was pretty much fatal in his race against Clinton. And now that it's just him and Biden, the story is virtually the same. In Mississippi, he took 11 percent of the black vote in 2016 and was taking 13 percent on Tuesday, according to exit polls. In Missouri, he took 32 percent in 2016 and was taking 28 percent on Tuesday. In Michigan, he moved from 28 percent four years ago to 29 percent on Tuesday.
The other is his reliance upon younger voters. Sanders's campaign has argued that he can win in the general election because of his unusual appeal to this low-turnout group, but thus far that hasn't panned out in the earliest contests. And it deserted him again on Tuesday. Voters between 18 and 44 were 40 percent of the vote in Mississippi in 2016, but just 31 percent on Tuesday. In Missouri, they were 41 percent in 2016 and 33 percent on Tuesday. In Michigan, youth turnout was the reason he pulled a shocking upset in 2016, but 18-to-44-year-olds' share of the vote dropped from 45 percent then to 38 percent on Tuesday.
Given that, Sanders needed to expand his appeal to older people and to working-class white voters, but he's regressed on both of those, too.
4. The calendar is turning in Biden's direction
As ominous for Sanders as what happened on Tuesday night was this: It might have been his best shot at actually getting back in the race this month.
In 2016, Sanders carried four of the six states that were up Tuesday - the three yet-to-be-determined states and Michigan. He also came within 0.25 percent in Missouri. The opportunity was there, but he lost ground.
Next week, by contrast, the primaries will be Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. Sanders lost all of them in 2016, including three of the four by double digits. All of them are demographically tough for him, for varying reasons, and all of them are relatively big delegate prizes, with about 200 more delegates at stake than there were on Tuesday night.
Then the week after that comes Georgia, a state with a large black population and many delegates.
In other words, it becomes very difficult to see how Biden doesn't come out of this month with a very large delegate prize. Sanders needs to do something to change the race in a big way, but it's not clear that he has the opportunity over the next two weeks.
Also consider this: The only states Sanders has won east of the Mississippi River are his home state of Vermont and the neighboring state of New Hampshire, which was very close. There simply aren't enough people in the western part of the country for Sanders, especially with California out of the way.
5. Biden's electability case grows
It wasn't just the surge in turnout in Michigan. Biden's wins also spanned the Democratic electorate in one very significant way.
The following is true in all three states that Biden won early Tuesday night: He won nonwhites who both went to college and didn't - no surprise there - but he also won both whites who went to college and those who didn't. The closest he came to losing any of them was in Michigan, where non-college whites were somewhat close.
You can't directly translate primary results to the general election, but for a Democratic Party that is twitchy about putting forward an electable candidate, you could do a lot worse than showing that kind of appeal to all corners of the party.

Former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), whose candidacies embody competing wings of the Democratic Party, have emerged as the leaders in the contest for their party's presidential nomination, according to a Washington Post-ABC News national poll.
The findings come little more than a week before the first votes of the 2020 campaign will be cast in Iowa's precinct caucuses, where there has been a spirited contest involving not only Biden and Sanders but also Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and entrepreneur Andrew Yang both hope to spring a surprise on the others on caucus night.
Based on past campaigns, the Iowa results will have an immediate impact on the overall shape of the race and on public attitudes, nationally and in individual states that immediately follow the Feb.-3 caucuses: New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. A Post average of recent New Hampshire polls shows Sanders and Biden virtually tied, with Warren and Buttigieg not far behind.
Nationally, however, the competition has moved in the direction of Biden and Sanders, with Warren, Buttigieg and others now clearly behind. Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning registered voters, Biden is favored by 32-percent with Sanders at 23-percent, according to the new Post-ABC poll. In both cases, those percentages are slightly better than what each received in an October Post-ABC national poll.
Warren is currently running third but has seen a significant drop in her support nationally, falling from 23-percent in October to 12-percent in the new poll. Still, she is the only other candidate for the Democratic nomination in double digits.
The fourth- and fifth-place candidates represent a shift in the Democratic hierarchy. Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who was not a candidate when the last Post-ABC survey was conducted but who has spent several hundred million dollars since then, runs fourth at 8-percent. Yang, whose debate performances have drawn favorable reviews and whose candidacy projects a non-politician's flair, is at 7-percent.
Buttigieg, whose rise in Iowa and New Hampshire earlier this year caught others in the field by surprise, is at 5-percent, reflecting modest slippage since October. Klobuchar is at 3-percent, Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) is at 2-percent, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick are at 1-percent.
The poll shows that Democrats are clearly motivated in this election, with 73-percent of Democratic leaners saying they are certain to vote in their state's primary or caucus. That's little changed since last July but significantly higher than the 59-percent who said in January 2016 they were certainly going to vote. Similarly, Democratic leaners are slightly more satisfied with their choices of candidates this year than they were four years ago.
Although 9 in 10 Democrats who named a candidate when asked whom they are supporting say they are enthusiastic about their choice, 53-percent overall say they still would consider another candidate. That is a reflection of the fluidity that has marked the Democratic campaign for most of the past year, as voters have tried to assess a record-large field and weigh who might be best against President Trump.
Biden's candidacy has been buoyed by perceptions that he is the candidate who could lead the party back to the White House, and the current poll again gives him the highest marks on that question. At this moment, 38-percent of Democratic leaners name Biden as having the best chance to beat Trump, with 18-percent naming Sanders and 10-percent naming Warren.
Biden also leads his rivals on two other questions that are central to the debate inside the party about the best path to victory, motivating the Democratic base or attracting independent or moderate voters. Many Democratic strategists say it will take a combination of both to overcome some of the advantages that Trump, as an incumbent during a time of low unemployment, currently enjoys.
On the question of who can best motivate the Democratic base, Biden is named by 32-percent while Sanders is named by 21-percent. Asked who can attract those independent and moderate voters, 29-percent name Biden and 17-percent name Sanders. No one else hits double digits on that question.
Biden and Sanders "" one running as a more moderate establishment figure and the other as a revolutionary democratic socialist "" are about even on the question of 'who comes closest to you on the issues,' with the senator from Vermont at 24-percent and Biden at 22-percent. Warren, whose liberal platform is closer to Sanders's than to Biden's, is third at 15-percent.
Biden's candidacy is also strengthened by the demographic pillars of support he has maintained throughout the year. As in many polls, he is the leading candidate among African Americans, with about half the support of black adults. He is also ahead among those Democrats who identify themselves as moderate or conservative and leads among voters 50 and older, where he holds a roughly a 3-to-1 advantage over Sanders.
The Post-ABC poll finds Sanders scores slightly better than Biden among voters under age 50, although his margin among this group is not as large as is Biden's among those over 50. The younger the voter, the more support Sanders gains, with the caveat that these younger voters historically have been more difficult to turn out in primaries or caucuses.
Sanders also is favored by Democrats who identify themselves as liberal and shows signs of building support among some nonwhite voters. 
Warren suffered slippage among many groups of voters since October, but particularly among women, where her support fell from 26-percent to 12-percent. She also dropped 15-points among self-identified liberals.
But while she trails Biden and Sanders as the first choice among Democratic voters, she does well when people are asked who represents their second choice. 
Overall, nearly a quarter (23-percent) name Warren as their second choice, slightly higher than either Sanders or Biden. When first and second choices are combined, Biden leads at 48-percent, followed by Sanders at 41-percent and Warren at 35-percent. All the other candidates trail by at least 20-points in this combination.
At the Democratic debate in Iowa earlier this month, Warren and Sanders tangled over whether he had told her privately that a woman could not win the presidency. He denied saying it, and she said he had. Warren used the opportunity to make a forceful case to answer questions about whether a woman is at a disadvantage in a presidential election.
The Post-ABC poll finds that fewer than 3-in-10 (28-percent) of Democratic-leaning adults say a man is more likely than a woman to defeat Trump, with 63-percent saying it doesn't matter and 7-percent saying a woman would have the advantage against this president. Women are no more or less likely than men to say a woman has a better chance of winning.
Support for Warren is significantly higher among voters who say either that it doesn't matter or who believe a woman has a better chance of winning, but she nonetheless trails Biden and Sanders among that group. Men overall are more likely than women to say either it doesn't matter or a woman has a better chance of beating Trump. Women are more likely than men to say a man has a better chance of beating Trump.
The Post-ABC poll was conducted by telephone from Monday through Thursday among a random national sample of 388 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, including 349 who are registered voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus six percentage points for both groups.

As moderates fret over his down-ballot effect, speaker toes a tight line
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has carefully managed every aspect of building and maintaining her Democratic majority "" from leading fundraising efforts to crafting a policy agenda to making the reluctant decision to pursue the impeachment of President Trump.
But as many Democrats fear an existential threat to their control of the House in presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, Pelosi (D-Calif.) is suddenly finding herself in the unusual role of bystander as her party's voters choose a nominee.
While a cadre of lawmakers and strategists are sounding alarms about the risks the senator from Vermont and democratic socialist would pose to down-ballot candidates, Pelosi is moving carefully publicly and privately to avoid even the perception that she is putting her thumb on the presidential scales.
'I think whoever our nominee is, we will enthusiastically embrace, and we will win the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives,' she told reporters Wednesday morning as she entered a closed-door caucus meeting.
Inside the room, according to notes taken by a person present for her remarks who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private meeting, Pelosi did not mention Sanders or any other candidate by name. Instead, she sounded a call for party unity amid the presidential rancor.
'I would hope that everyone would say, no matter who the nominee is for president, we wholeheartedly embrace that person,' she said, mentioning the stakes in state and local races ahead of the coming post-census redistricting cycle. 'We led the way in 2018. We will lead it now, and, again, until everybody else has their houses in order. But we cannot show any division. This has to be about unity, unity, unity.' 
Among her caucus, the prospect of a Sanders nomination is politically frightening "" including to some of Pelosi's closest House allies.
'I think that we're all at risk with Bernie,' said freshman Rep. Donna Shalala (D-Fla.), who warned that Sanders's comments praising some aspects of the communist regimes in Cuba and other Latin American countries would put electoral votes and House seats in Florida, a key swing state, at risk.
House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (S.C.) became the highest-ranking congressional Democrat to tender a presidential endorsement Wednesday when he backed former vice president Joe Biden days ahead of the primary in Clyburn's home state. He later told reporters at the Capitol that the endorsement was inspired partly out of down-ballot concern. 
Asked whether a Sanders nomination could cost Democrats the House majority, Clyburn said, 'I don't know if he would or not "" that's not a chance I want to take.'
But according to interviews with a half-dozen members and aides allied with Pelosi and familiar with her thinking, past and present, it would be a mistake to expect Pelosi to follow Clyburn's lead and insert herself into the presidential race.
Such a move, they said, would not only go against her practice, dating back more than 16 years, of not endorsing in the presidential primaries, but it would also undermine her leadership of a diverse caucus in which opinions range from fervent support for Sanders to strong backing for Biden and other more centrist candidates "" not to mention a donor base that runs the same gamut.
'She's not going to get involved,' said Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.). 'You've got to reach the needs, if you're the leader, of all the different people, and give them their forum. So you have to let the process work its way out.'
Another Democrat who has talked with Pelosi and spoke on the condition of anonymity to frankly describe private conversations said she has been more concerned about the tenor of the recent debates "" which have featured nasty attacks among the candidates "" than Sanders's potential impact down ballot.
Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), one of Sanders's most prominent congressional supporters, said leaders have to be mindful of the next internal election when they take sides in a contest as divisive as the pending presidential race "" and she praised Pelosi for maintaining her neutrality.
'I think that weighing in would not be appropriate for the speaker,' Jayapal said. 'I think she plays a very important role in staying neutral and calming everybody down, to remember that our ultimate responsibility is to the voters.'
But the pressure on Pelosi to get involved only stands to grow in the coming weeks and months. The concern was aired on the presidential debate stage Tuesday night in South Carolina, where candidate Pete Buttigieg warned in stark terms that a Sanders nomination would put the House at risk.
The former South Bend, Ind., mayor said a Sanders nomination would mean 'four more years of Donald Trump, Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House, and the inability to get the Senate into Democratic hands. The time has come for us to stop acting like the presidency is the only office that matters.' 
As it happens: McCarthy (R-Calif.), the House minority leader, signaled Wednesday the GOP would move immediately to tie congressional Democrats to Sanders by forcing a vote this week on a resolution condemning Sanders's comments praising some aspects of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro's regime: 'Do they stand with Bernie, or do they stand for freedom?' he said to reporters.
Democrats who are hoping Pelosi takes a more active role are not looking for an endorsement but rather would like her to be a power broker in uniting the support now fragmented among more moderate candidates like Biden, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).
'It's more of an effort to try and go to some of the more moderate candidates and see if they can kind of coalesce behind someone and make a deal,' said one centrist Democratic lawmaker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions. 'There's a lot of influential people in the party, gray-haired eminences, who could have some sort of role.'
Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), a But tigieg supporter, said Pelosi was one of the only Democrats in the country "" alongside former president Barack Obama "" who would have the stature to play that role. But, he quickly added, 'There's no indication either one of them wants to play that role right now.'
'She certainly has the gravitas, the wisdom, the acute sense of strategy to do something like that,' Beyer said.
Asked Wednesday about whether she thought she had the power to help cull the field, Pelosi said, 'The power is with the people.'
That sentiment is shared with many moderates, who fear a repeat of 2016 "" when Sanders supporters were left smarting after the Democratic National Committee appeared to tilt the playing field toward eventual nominee Hillary Clinton. Some have blamed the hard feelings for Clinton's eventual loss to Trump.
Rep. Darren Soto (D-Fla.), who represents a central Florida district and sharply criticized Sanders's recent Cuba comments, said any coordinated effort among the party leadership 'would have the exact opposite of the desired effect' on the electorate.
'We saw an attempt to stack the deck in 2016, and that did not work so well,' he said. 'Let the voters decide. Let it roll.'
Shalala, too, said it was up to voters "" not Pelosi "" to speak out: 'They know who he is. They know what he said. They know he's wrong. And they have to speak.'

GRINNELL, Iowa "" When Democrats here went to bed on the night of their first-in-the-nation caucuses four years ago, the bitterly fought contest between Hillary Clinton and the insurgent Sen. Bernie Sanders was too close to call. So an abrupt predawn notice from the state party declaring Clinton the winner sent some into a fury.
Shaky videos of coin tosses deciding delegates in Clinton's favor spread on Twitter. Stories multiplied of confused caucus-goers, untrained volunteers and mathematical inconsistencies, all amid a wave of suspicion that the party was manipulating the process for Clinton's benefit.
'I never got a satisfactory explanation for how they arrived at their number,' said J. Pablo Silva, a historian at Grinnell College who wasn't alerted when the state party transferred a delegate from Sanders to Clinton in the precinct in this small college town where he was serving as a caucus secretary.

Now, as Iowa Democrats hurtle once again toward the opening faceoff of a hard-fought presidential primary cycle "" with at least four candidates seemingly in contention to win Iowa's Feb. 3 contest "" some in the party fear that reforms put in place to prevent the disarray of 2016 may create an entirely new set of problems in 2020.
It has long been the tradition here that voting plays out in school gyms and church basements, with multiple vote tabulations as supporters of candidates who do not reach a threshold on the initial vote scramble to make a second choice among the remaining contenders. This year, for the first time, the state party will release the initial raw vote totals as well as the final delegate allocation.
The change will mean more transparency, but it also will add to the workload of party officials and volunteer leaders "" and it raises the possibility that multiple campaigns could claim a victory of sorts, with supporters of one candidate seeing another's triumph as illegitimate.
The changes have yielded a thick new rule book for caucus organizers, who have undergone months of training on matters including new reporting requirements, mathematical formulas for delegate allocation, and combating false rumors that may spread online and cast doubt on the results. Some who have participated in the training sessions say the new system feels even more daunting than the old one.
Adding to the anxiety is the closeness of the race, which once again features an ascendant Sanders (I-Vt.), whose backers are on guard for any hint of irregularities, as well as the sense that any controversy over the results could hamper efforts to unify Democrats before the eventual nominee faces President Trump in November.
'We were cognizant about wanting to make it less confusing,' said Norm Sterzenbach, a longtime Democratic strategist in Iowa who was involved in planning for the caucuses until he signed on last year with former congressman Beto O'Rourke (D-Tex.), and then with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). 'But making the process more rigorous of course adds new complexity.'



In a way, the caucus process is insulated from cybersecurity threats and other concerns looming over more-traditional voting processes. There are no voting machines to hack. Instead, caucus-goers register their preferences in plain view of one another. In theory, any confusion could be ironed out through deliberation.
'In any election, even for school board or dogcatcher, there is rumor and innuendo,' said Matt Paul, who ran Clinton's Iowa campaign in 2016. 'The difference in Iowa is that it's all in the open. You have to stand up in front of your friends and neighbors and tell them who you're supporting and why.'
But the 2016 experience revealed how easily confusion and chaos can take hold.
In the Grinnell precinct where the delegate was transferred, uncertainty had reigned for much of the night. The Sanders supporters were 'incredibly disorganized,' said Silva, and ended up having to count multiple times because the number they presented was implausible. Meanwhile, Iowans supporting Martin O'Malley, the former Maryland governor, grew frustrated and left. Andy McGuire, the state Democratic Party's chairwoman at the time, said the overnight delegate transfer was necessary to correct an input error.
Across Iowa, however, the videos of coin tosses stoked outrage, even though the practice is routine "" being used to allocate leftover delegates depending on the breakdown "" and favored Sanders in certain cases, as well. As doubt took hold about the razor-thin margins, calls for a recount intensified. But Iowa Democratic leaders said that was impossible. 'People physically aligned in groups,' the state party's communications director said at the time. 'There are no paper ballots to recount.'
Sanders called on the party to report a raw vote count. When the party leadership said it lacked the capacity to do so, Sanders's supporters took to Reddit in a quest to uncover the numbers. On the Republican side, supporters of then-candidate Donald Trump suggested on social media that Microsoft, whose software was used to tally votes, had tilted the contest against their candidate. Trump himself claimed without evidence that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who narrowly won in Iowa, 'illegally stole' the caucuses.
The Des Moines Register called the caucuses a 'debacle,' singling out the Democrats for blame and finding, 'Once again the world is laughing at Iowa.'
'The Iowa Democratic Party really learned from 2016,' said Steven Drahozal, the Democratic chairman in Dubuque County.




Part of the party's learning involved realizing, from the special counsel's investigation of Russian interference in the presidential campaign, how suspicion of the caucus process became a seed for the Kremlin's influence campaign. In August 2016, Russian operatives using social media sowed doubt about the integrity of Iowa's result, in an apparent effort to undermine Clinton's legitimacy as she prepared to face Trump. An ad promoted by Russian actors on Facebook alleged that 'Hillary Clinton has already committed voter fraud during the Democrat Iowa Caucus,' according to a federal indictment of multiple Russians filed in 2018.

For party officials here, the revelation underscored the need to arm staffers against not just cyberattacks but also against false narratives that are amplified on social media. Iowa Democrats say they are conscious of how quickly rumors about manipulation and backroom dealings can spread "" particularly if amplified by Trump, who has shown keen interest in influencing the outcome of the Democratic primaries.
'Disinformation is something new we saw last election cycle, but people didn't know it was happening at the time,' said Troy Price, the chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party. 'Here, we know it's going on, and we've had time to prepare for it.'
The state party, along with its Republican counterpart, partnered with the Defending Digital Democracy Project at Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. The project's leaders conducted a simulation with the parties in November. They were joined by security experts as well as developers behind the websites and mobile apps used by the parties to publicize caucus details and report returns.
Details of a mishap would arrive via email, bringing news, for example, of an app malfunction or of specious tweets claiming that the caucuses actually would begin at 8-p.m., an hour later than the official 7 p.m. start time. A space was cordoned off for mock news conferences, where people pretending to be reporters clamored for updates.
Democrats used the simulation to develop possible plans for caucus night "" including contingencies such as bringing in the Department of Homeland Security and contacting executives at Twitter.
Some of the more complex changes arising from the breakdown in 2016 involve the handling of results on caucus night.
The voting involves Iowans' assembling in groups to signal their support for one candidate or another. These groups are known in caucus parlance as 'alignments.' The relative sizes of the alignments are used to calculate delegate allocations. In most precincts, delegates are allocated only to candidates who receive at least 15 percent of the vote.
A candidate wins the caucuses by securing the most projected delegates to the state convention, which translates in turn to delegates to the party's national nominating convention. This year, the party will release raw totals from the first as well as the second alignments "" as different factions jostle for support and seek to win over undecided caucusgoers. The totals will be recorded by tallying 'Presidential Preference Cards,' which will also provide a paper trail should a problem arise with the mobile app used to report returns.
In another change from past cycles, only members of alignments that are not large enough to reach the 15-percent threshold will be allowed to shift to other groups, a procedure known as realignment. For groups above the threshold, the count will be locked in, and those caucus-goers will be able to go home. Further, national delegates will be allocated once caucus-night results come in, rather than over the course of county and district conventions.
The delegate selection plan spells out a process for candidates to request a review of caucus results, as well as a timeline for the state party to respond.
And, in yet another change, the state party approved nearly 100 satellite caucus locations, where Democrats who completed preregistration by Jan. 17 will be able to participate. The sites include three places abroad where expatriate Iowans took the initiative to apply to host caucus assemblies "" Glasgow, Scotland; Paris; and Tbilisi, the capital of the former Soviet republic of Georgia. 

A 10-person review committee weighed applications on the basis of each location's accessibility, proximity to other precincts and demonstrated need for the site.
A plan to allow Iowans to participate by phone in a virtual caucus was scrapped last year when national party leaders said there wasn't technology that could be protected from hacking. The decision highlighted the premium placed on security, which won out over the desire for greater accessibility.

Still, the reforms amount to the 'most significant changes to the Iowa Caucuses since 1972,' the party says on its website.
The changes are also proving to be confusing, even to some old Iowa hands. Lyz Lenz, a columnist for the Cedar Rapids Gazette, recently completed the online training prepared for caucus chairs and came away bewildered, confused especially by the calculation required to apportion delegates. 'I can't say exactly, but I know you have to divide something by six,' she said.
At town halls, candidates are fielding questions about the rules and 'strategy' for securing delegates on caucus night.
Responding to one such query recently, the entrepreneur Andrew Yang said that 'we have done the math, and here in Davenport, we believe we'll be well over the 15-percent threshold.'
A record turnout, which is expected, could deepen the confusion, said McGuire, the former party chair who is running Klobuchar's Iowa campaign.
County chairs and other Democratic officials are in overdrive trying to prepare the volunteers who preside on caucus night. In a recent email to Democrats in Dubuque County, Drahozal urged caucus leaders to complete the training and take an accompanying test.

Rules and procedure aside, Drahozal said, party leaders can take steps to protect the integrity of the process. He is remaining 'adamantly, adamantly neutral' until caucus night.

That sort of forbearance is a sign of the times, said Sterzenbach, whose extensive knowledge of Iowa's singular political tradition has earned him the nickname 'Mr. Caucus.'
The contest in '2016 was so close, and it showed how much distrust of the system there was,' he said. 'Much work went into addressing that.'

Democratic Party elders are bewildered. Don't voters understand how unpopular Sen. Bernie Sanders is in Washington? ""Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done,"" Hillary Clinton, still smarting from the wound he inflicted on her 2016 presidential campaign, said in January. ""It's all just baloney, and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it."" The consequences, the party establishment fears, could be dire: Sanders will be George McGovern all over again - roundly thrashed in the general election by a sinister incumbent, just like the unexpected lefty winner of the 1972 primaries.
Sanders does have a historical forerunner, but it isn't McGovern. It's Ronald Reagan.
The comparison looks implausible. The genial, soothing, archconservative Reagan, with his Hollywood polish, script-reading skills and two terms as governor of California, seems a long way from the cantankerous socialist senator, with his accent scraped off the Brooklyn sidewalks and his following formed in tiny, remote, hippie Vermont.
But Reagan was also labeled a fringe figure - of the right, not the left. Mainstream Republicans viewed him with alarm and ridiculed his proposals as simple and kooky. Like Sanders, Reagan shrugged off his detractors. Like Sanders, he bore little allegiance to the party. Like Sanders, he was said to appeal to only a narrow slice of voters. The two have something else in common. Both waged a hard-fought battle in a previous presidential primary contest, seeding their insurgent movements and building bases of young voters undeterred by the candidates' advanced ages. Reagan was a spoiler turned tribune to a new Republican Party. Sanders, a spoiler in 2016, is on his way to remaking the Democratic Party, no matter how this year's campaign ends.
Reagan emerged as a national figure in the 1960s and '70s, a proud debunker of ""the Washington establishment."" His checkered political history included fundraising for an official in the far-right John Birch Society, sharing platforms with Southern segregationists and warning that Medicare (soon to become law) would put the nation on the road to serfdom. Mainstream Republicans were horrified. ""Extremist fringe elements seek to expel the rest of us from the GOP,"" John Anderson, a high-ranking Republican congressman, warned when Reaganites began to make inroads into the party. ""If the purists stage their ideological coup d'etat, our party will be consigned to the historical junk heap.""
Anderson's warning came in 1977, a year after Reagan's insurgent challenge to a sitting Republican president, Gerald Ford, went all the way to the Republican convention, splitting the party in two. Reagan was the leader of a movement, not a GOP loyalist. He had nothing at stake in Ford's victory and was looking ahead. When 1980 came, he was the front-runner, but the GOP, still fearful, looked for alternatives. ""Anyone but Reagan"" was a popular refrain.
Forty years later, this history looks familiar. Sanders the provocateur has bashed the establishment and even now won't retract his praise of Fidel Castro (or, at least, his literacy programs). His ""Bernie Bros"" seem eager to cast out party regulars and stage their own version of an ideological coup. Yet he joined the race in 2020 with the same advantage Reagan had in 1980: the support gained four years earlier, when people flocked to his rallies, thrilled to his call for democratic socialism and delivered their votes. Sanders very nearly upset Clinton in Iowa, routed her in New Hampshire and harried her all the way through the primaries, refusing to quit even after it was clear that she would win the nomination. Subtract the ""superdelegates"" awarded to Clinton, and the totals were surprisingly close: 2,205 pledged votes to Clinton and 1,846 to Sanders.
The message should have been clear. Sanders was no mere spoiler but the emerging leader of a movement to wrest the Democratic Party from its longtime leaders. One who saw this was David Axelrod, the architect of Barack Obama's two victories. In 2015, Axelrod, who runs a political institute in Chicago, invited Sanders to speak there. ""Got a first-hand look at the @BernieSanders phenomenon today,"" Axelrod tweeted. ""2,000 in hall. 500 in overflow. And 2500 couldn't get in.""
Still, Sanders's appeal seemed limited in reach. His followers were mainly young - college students, in many cases - and predominantly white. Despite his achievements in Iowa and New Hampshire, he underperformed in South Carolina and Georgia, where Clinton won more than 70 percent of the vote. Reagan, too, was seen as appealing to a subset of his party. ""He's never demonstrated substantial national appeal,"" George Will wrote in 1974, when Reagan's followers were urging him to run. ""His hard-core support today consists primarily of the kamikaze conservatives who thought the 1964 Goldwater campaign was jolly fun.""
There was also the problem of Reagan's age. It made him an unlikely choice to lead the GOP into a new era. ""Reagan is 63 and looks it,"" Will pointed out. ""He looks like an old man."" Elected six years later at 69, Reagan was the oldest president in history (since surpassed by Donald Trump). His age made no difference to young voters. In 1980, he split the youth vote evenly with the much younger incumbent, Jimmy Carter, and did even better in 1984. The pollster Lou Harris found that ""younger voters seem to have something of a fascination with and attraction to a President who is approaching 74 years of age."" And they chose him over the Democrat, Walter Mondale, by a wide margin; Reagan won more than 60 percent of the 25-and-under vote. His famous quip about Mondale's ""youth and inexperience"" was for the benefit of older voters.
Sanders's following is also young. He did best with these voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, and in South Carolina he won those under 30, continuing to win that demographic in Super Tuesday states. These voters don't seem to care that he's 78.
One reason Democratic insiders resist Sanders is that he defies the wisdom that ""the party decides."" They know that this thesis was discredited for the GOP in 2016, when Trump swamped the field, but they prefer to think this is a distinctly Republican problem, a result of ideological bankruptcy. It's hard for them to accept that their own party is undergoing a similar revolution from below; the idea persists that Sanders is not the leader of the party, but the Pied Piper of an extremist faction and not even really a Democrat. This second proposition is true - Sanders remains an independent who caucuses with the Democrats in the Senate - but it doesn't delegitimize him in the eyes of voters. It enhances his prestige.
Reagan blazed a similar trail. For much of his life, he was not a reliable party man. He was a New Deal Democrat who didn't join the GOP until 1962, when he was 51. This mattered little to conservatives. They responded to the things Reagan said and saw him as the leader of a Republican Party closer to their idea of what it should be.
The same is true of Sanders. The spoiler of 2016 is now the tribune of the new Democratic Party. Even detractors acknowledge that he has moved the party to the left. His working-class message and issues - free college, universal health care, a $15 minimum wage - are now standard Democratic talking points. They reflect the concerns of a rising generation that thinks the economic odds are stacked against them, even if they have checked all the right boxes. ""The 21st century is basically defined by nonessential human beings, who do not fit into the market as consumers or producers or as laborers,"" as a host of the ardently pro-Sanders Chapo Trap House podcast has said. Most Americans think that the health-care system isn't working and that the federal government should do more to help them. Even those who are leery of Sanders's Medicare-for-all proposal recognize that he understands the depth of the problem and isn't content to tinker at the edges. And while raising taxes on the ""billionaire class"" won't pay for all the costly programs Sanders wants, a large majority of Americans agree with the principle that the wealthy don't pay enough in taxes.
Reagan, too, was much bolder than party regulars when it came to taxes. His embrace of ""supply-side economics"" - the theory that reducing taxes on the wealthy would stimulate growth and expand the economy, resulting in greater tax revenue - was ridiculed in 1980. George H.W. Bush, his rival in the primary race, called it ""voodoo economics."" Wall Street insiders who normally voted Republican worried that Reagan's ""radically new policies,"" as The Washington Post described them, such as slashing income taxes by as much as 30 percent, could ""destroy his candidacy."" But the economy had stalled, with high unemployment and rising inflation, and Carter's more conventional proposals hadn't worked.
Reagan's foreign policy beliefs also seemed dangerous at a time when the two Cold War superpowers appeared locked in permanent conflict. His avowed anti-communism struck experts as needlessly belligerent, ""tragically wrong and blind to the long-range opportunities for a better East-West relationship,"" said Carter's national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski. But voters too young to remember the high-flown rhetoric of a president like John F. Kennedy, who spoke of a ""twilight struggle,"" heard in Reagan the first leader of their own era who spoke of American promise, who wasn't afraid to call the Soviet Union an ""evil empire,"" who didn't seem to sag under the country's accumulated defeats, including the Vietnam War. The confidence came in part from the long years Reagan spent honing his message, dating all the way back to his time as a General Electric spokesman in the 1950s.
The same is true of Sanders. The message he delivers so relentlessly seems fanatical to some in the Democratic establishment. But among younger voters who have come of age at a time when politics seems cynical and transactional, a game rigged for insiders, Sanders has built a deep reservoir of credibility. He has also worked diligently to attract new followers. His base consisted of more than enthusiastic young, white men as he entered the race last year. ""Sanders is more popular with people of color than white people, and women like Sanders as much as men do, if not more,"" Vox pointed out then. He won 27 percent of the African American vote and an overwhelming 51 percent of the Latino vote in Nevada. He has been courting both groups. Latino caucus-goers wearing Sanders buttons were heard to say that his was the only campaign they ""ever heard from,"" the New York Times reported. He met with overlooked Hispanic voters in California and in Iowa, as well, and on Super Tuesday was the overwhelming choice of Latinos in Texas and California. He began connecting with African American voters in 2018, when he spoke at a Black Lives Matter rally in Los Angeles. Even in South Carolina, where Joe Biden won easily on the strength of support from African American voters, Sanders did as well or better with black voters under 30, according to exit polls, as he did with black voters under 30 in Texas.
As Democrats study the electoral college map, they are intent on winning back the 40,000 white working-class voters in battleground states who defected to Trump in 2016 after, at least in some instances, voting for Obama in 2008 and again in 2012. The Sanders campaign's answer is that he doesn't need those people, because he will turn out waves of new voters - a progressive version of what was once called the ""woodwork theory of hidden conservatives."" Here, history is not on his side. And the early returns in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada have not been encouraging. There was a large increase in voter turnout in South Carolina, but it went to Biden, and a huge turnout of young voters did not materialize on Super Tuesday.
Once again, Reagan suggests an answer. He didn't uncover legions of new voters. Instead he found them in the other party. For example, evangelical voters went for Carter by 25 points in 1976; in 1980, they went against him by 26 points. Can the ""Reagan Democrats"" of 1980 become ""Sanders Republicans"" in 2020? Not if 90 percent or more of Republicans continue to support Trump. The only hope will be to shake loose independents weary of Trump or catch the fire of Sanders's truly populist crusade. In the battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the number of Sanders primary voters in 2016 who chose Trump in the general election exceeded Trump's margin of victory in those states by large margins.
Older Democrats remember the defeats the party met when it went too far left. The term ""democratic socialist"" frightens them, and Sanders's gleeful class warfare does, too. But to younger voters, Sanders's uncompromising attitude feels fresh and candid, while ""pragmatic"" calls for moderation and ""working across the aisle"" feel hollow and stale. Even if he fails to win the nomination or, if he gets it, the general election, he will have remade the party in anticipation of the time when demographics catch up with his vision and turn important red states blue. Then the new Democratic Party may look back at the spoiler and outlier Sanders, the ""extremist"" whom ""nobody likes,"" as the most persuasive voice for a politics of hope in an age dominated by fear.
The paradox of Reagan was that his radical message, while it sounded new, revived beliefs and values that had defined the GOP of an earlier time, when it cast itself as the party of Main Street and what later came to be called ""middle America."" His radicalism was really a form of reinvention, and he was its best exemplar. Like Sanders, whose own crusade is rooted in venerable principles of economic and social justice, he seemed to personify the vision he projected.

EPA, safety-net programs Targeted 
Budget plan provides fuel for Democratic campaigns
The White House on Monday proposed a $4.8 trillion election-year budget that would slash major domestic and safety-net programs, setting up a stark contrast with President Trump's rivals as voting gets underway in the Democratic presidential primary.
The budget would pursue hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid and seek reductions in the Children's Health Insurance Program, while wringing some savings from Medicare despite Trump's repeated promises to safeguard the program for older Americans. 
The budget is a proposal to Congress, and lawmakers have mostly rejected the White House's proposed cuts in the past. Still, the budget plan sets up the Trump administration's policy priorities heading into the November election and is likely to draw scrutiny in Washington and on the campaign trail. Trump has in the past not shown much interest in pursuing the budget cuts his aides have offered, and he didn't make any public comments about the plan Monday.
Instead, one of his top advisers defended the proposed cuts, even as Democratic presidential candidates blasted the reductions.
Russell Vought, acting White House budget director, touted the proposed spending increases in the budget for NASA, immigration, opioid mitigation and veterans, while saying they would not lead to benefit reductions for Medicare and Medicaid, as Democrats charged. Vought also said the budget includes widespread cuts in federal waste that would bring down the deficit.
'We stand with families and businesses across the country who have to balance their budgets,' Vought told reporters. 'Washington, D.C., does not stand with them and for too long has operated under a different principle of recklessly spending other people's money. That has to change, and hopefully this budget will lead to it.'
A central theme of the new budget plan is its attempt to scale back domestic programs. It would slash the Environmental Protection Agency budget by 26.5 percent over the next year and cut the Department of Health and Human Services budget by 9 percent. HHS includes the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which would see a budget cut even as it is under intense scrutiny over its response to the coronavirus. Officials said the part of the CDC that responds to emergencies like the coronavirus would be protected.
'This is the future President Trump envisions for our nation,' said House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.). 'One where the federal government relinquishes any responsibility for the well-being of the American people in our nation. What the president has put forth is a destructive and irrational budget that intentionally goes after working families and vulnerable Americans.'
The plan would target the Education Department for a nearly 8-percent cut, and the Interior Department would be cut 13.4 percent. The State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development would be cut by 22 percent.
Trump has sought spending cuts in the past, only to back down immediately during negotiations with Democrats. For example, he has sought to cut numerous federal agencies multiple times and then reversed himself and approved budget increases. That's because Trump has pushed for huge increases in military spending, and Democrats have said they would go along with such changes only if Trump backed more money for housing, education and health care.
Proposing the cuts again, on the eve of the New Hampshire Democratic primary, gave Democrats a fresh target to attack.
'The old cliche is that a budget is a moral document,' Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said in a statement. 'What kind of unbelievable moral framework allowed this White House to propose $182 billion in cuts to nutrition assistance from needy families, when nearly one in seven households with children are food insecure?'
Trump did not defend any of the cuts in public. Over the weekend, he commented on the budget proposal just briefly, noting on Twitter that he would not touch Social Security or Medicare.
But even some of Trump's staunchest allies criticized his sharp cuts for domestic agencies, such as the Agriculture Department, which he is targeting for an 8 percent overall reduction. That was an indication that the budget will get a cold shoulder on Capitol Hill from lawmakers of both parties who will be responsible for writing spending bills into law that will actually fund the government when fiscal 2021 begins Oct.-1.
'I applaud the Administration for aiming to tackle the debt and deficit by addressing federal spending, but I do not support the disproportionate cuts to important agricultural programs,' Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said in a statement. 'The cuts proposed today would save little but inflict severe pain in American agriculture.'
Trump has made homelessness a key focus in the past year, but his budget would seek a big reduction in housing funds. He proposed an $8.6 billion cut for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, a 15.2 percent decrease from the amount enacted for 2020. The cuts, as in previous years, include eliminating the four-decade-old Community Development Block Grant program popular among congressional Democrats and Republicans as well as affordable housing grants to states and municipalities to help with the construction, purchase or rental of homes.
The block grants, funds that Congress has restored in past budgets, provide cities with money for affordable housing and other community needs such as fighting blight, improving infrastructure and delivering food to homebound seniors. The administration, in its budget documents, said the program 'has not demonstrated sufficient impact.'
Housing advocates were not surprised by the proposed cuts because they were similar to past proposals and they urged Congress to reject them as it has largely done in the past. Advocates pointed to the flat funding of homeless assistance grants as a sign of the administration's lack of seriousness on ending homelessness, especially given Trump's recent focus on the housing crisis in California. The budget plan indicated that the administration will begin a new initiative to reduce street homelessness, targeting select cities, but provides no further details.
Parts of the budget, however, show how the White House has shifted in the face of political blowback from past plans. It would preserve, for example, a handful of politically sensitive programs that in some cases have provoked uproars and caused Trump to backpedal when he has tried to cut them in the past.
These include the Special Olympics and the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative "" a program important to Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, critical states in the presidential election. Even as White House officials kept the Great Lakes fund steady, as they did for an ecosystem protection program in South Florida, similar programs in other, less politically important states are cut in the Trump budget.
The budget plan would also preserve State Department and Pentagon aid for Ukraine, something the White House tried to delay last year in a move that led to Trump's impeachment by the House of Representatives. However, the Ukraine portion of a State Department anti-corruption program called International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement would fall under the budget proposal, to $13 million from $30 million this year. Congress has rejected that proposed cut in the past.
Still, some agencies would be spared and even see a proposed increase.
Trump's new budget calls for an increase in funding for the Department of Homeland Security, while keeping Pentagon spending mostly flat. The NASA budget would increase by 12 percent with new money aimed at putting astronauts back on the Moon.
Even with all the other proposed spending cuts, the budget would fail to eliminate the federal deficit over the next 10 years, missing a longtime GOP fiscal target. Instead, White House officials said their budget proposal would close the deficit by 2035.
But it would only achieve this if the economy grows at an unprecedented, sustained 3 percent clip through 2025, levels the administration has failed to achieve for even one year so far. The U.S. economy grew 2.3 percent in 2019, the weakest level since Trump took office. Many economists say growth will remain sluggish this year.
Because the government spends much more money than it brings in, the Treasury Department must borrow the difference by issuing debt. The debt has grown by about $3 trillion since Trump took office, and the budget plan would add more than $5-trillion to it over the next decade. There is currently more than $20 trillion in government debt, something Trump had promised to eliminate by 2025 when running for office.
Trump's budget aims to cut spending on safety-net programs such as Medicaid and food stamps, slashing spending on the latter by $181 billion over a decade. It proposes to squeeze hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicare over a decade through cost-saving proposals such as reforming medical liability and modifying payments to hospitals for uncompensated care.
A senior administration official defended the Medicaid cut, noting that it reflects a decrease in the rate at which spending would grow rather than a reduction from current spending levels. The official said the administration would save money on Medicaid spending through new work requirements and recouping payments incorrectly spent by the federal government.
During the last year President Barack Obama was in office, the deficit was less than $600 billion, but it has grown significantly in subsequent years.
As part of the new budget plan, the White House would seek to make permanent parts of the 2017 tax cut that are set to expire after 2025. The budget says extending these tax cuts through the end of the decade would amount to a $1.4 trillion tax cut.

Sharp attacks replace wonky policy contrasts ahead of N.H. vote

MANCHESTER, N.H. ""
The Democratic campaign entered a more combustible phase Friday as the party's candidates attacked each other on a debate stage with blistering policy critiques and arguments over who was best positioned to beat President Trump in November.
With no clear front-runner and four days to go before the New Hampshire primary, seven of the party's leading candidates abandoned the wonky policy contrasts and opaque tonal critiques that had filled the race before Monday's caucuses in Iowa. The debate stage became a free-fire zone instead, the candidates seizing the moment to call each other out. 
They harped on age and political records, flashed anger and indignation, and warned their rivals' policy prescriptions would fail. Multiple candidates cautioned that the polling leader, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), would not be electable given his identification as a democratic socialist. 
In a sign of the reordering of the Democratic primary race, it was Sanders and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg who often took control of the stage, engaging in impassioned monologues "" and seeing their records scrutinized "" while rivals raised their hands in the hopes of being called on next.
Former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) entered the evening looking to break out of their sudden second-tier status, as billionaire former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, while not on the ballot or on the debate stage here, continues to increase his campaign spending in the hopes of upsetting the race when he begins appearing on ballots next month.
In one of the most pointed parries, Buttigieg, 38, attacked Biden's longevity in politics, suggesting the party should not 'fall back on the familiar' and urging voters to 'finally allow us to leave the politics of the past in the past.' 
'The politics of the past were not all that bad!' Biden, 77, interjected, pointing toward measures on violence against women, arms control and other legislation he shepherded over the course of more than four decades as a U.S. senator and vice president. 
'I don't know what about the past of Barack Obama and Joe Biden that were so bad,' he said.
Buttigieg also turned toward Sanders, saying a nominee can't be someone 'dividing people with a politics that says if you don't go all the way to the edge, it doesn't count. A politics that says it's my way or the highway.
'Politics should be one of addition and inclusion and belonging,' he said, 'not one that beats people over the head and says they shouldn't even be on our side if we don't agree 100 percent of the time.' Asked if he was referring to Sanders, Buttigieg said yes. 
'I've never said that,' Sanders, 78, responded. 'But let me tell you what I do say. The way you bring people together is by presenting an agenda that works for the working people of this country, not for the billionaire class.' 
Although absent, Bloomberg came under unified condemnation from the stage.
'It's a funny thing,' Sanders said. 'There are millions of people who can desire to run for office. But I guess if you're worth $60-billion and you can spend several hundred million dollars on commercials, you have a slight advantage. That is nonsense.' 
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) agreed: 'I don't think people look at the guy in the White House and say 'We need someone richer.' '
Biden was more pointed with his rivals than in past debates but seemed to struggle at times to get his message across, while Warren kept her answers focused on the campaign messages she has been delivering for months. Klobuchar, 59, had her strongest debate showing so far, making a direct appeal to a New Hampshire electorate filled with moderates.
'I do not have the biggest name up on this stage. I don't have the biggest bank account. I'm not a political newcomer with no record,' she said. 'But I have a record of fighting for people.'
Klobuchar went up against both Sanders and "" in another chapter in an ongoing dispute "" Buttigieg. She reminded Buttigieg of a line he used regularly in Iowa during the impeachment trial in which he called the proceedings 'exhausting' enough to make him want to change the channel and watch cartoons instead.
After a lively and rambunctious start, however, the candidates also tried to show some form of unity. Buttigieg defended Biden, saying Democrats should not worry about Republican threats to investigate Biden and his son Hunter. 
'We're not going to let them change the subject. This is not about Hunter Biden or vice president Biden or any Biden,' he said. 'This is about abuse of power by the president. The vice president and all of us are competing, but we've got to draw the line somewhere.' 
Biden went over to hug Sanders at one point, both of them displaying wide grins. Warren, 70, tried to cast herself as a unifying candidate and generally refrained from some of the intraparty squabbling. 
'Bernie and I've been friends for a long time,' she said. 'We have a lot of things in common. We have a lot of things that we differ on.'




The sudden shift of dynamics after Monday's Iowa caucuses has raised concern among party leaders that there will be no quick conclusion to the nominating process, potentially forcing a drawn-out contest that deepens party divisions and leads to a weakened nominee. 
'I don't think there's any question, after this week, that Donald Trump can get reelected,' business executive Tom Steyer said, repeatedly returning to the anxiety coursing through the party. 'We have got to win or we are in deep trouble.' 
Even Sanders, who won more popular votes in the Iowa caucuses than any other candidate, admitted that the turnout in the state did not reach the levels of the 2008 election. 'That's a disappointment,' Sanders said. 'And I think all of us probably could have done a better job turning out our supporters.'
Parts of the party are worried about Buttigieg's limited experience and Sanders's democratic socialist identity. At the same time, Biden's claim on electability was undercut by his fourth-place finish in Iowa, and Warren, overshadowed with her third-place finish, has been trying to avoid an embarrassing result Tuesday next door to her home state of Massachusetts.
Biden took critical time away from the campaign trail this week to spend two days at home in Wilmington, Del., as he prepared for the debate, met with advisers and restructured his campaign.
'I took a hit in Iowa and I will probably take a hit here,' Biden said in his first answer of the evening.

Buttigieg challenged Biden's assertion that the party needs to nominate a safe bet "" which Biden defines as himself "" arguing that the bigger risk would be to nominate someone who represents the old ways of doing things.
'The perspective I'm bringing is from somebody whose life has been shaped by the decisions made in those big white buildings [in Washington],' Buttigieg said. 'We need a perspective . . . that will allow us to leave the politics of the past in the past.' 
His opponents cast him as naive. 
'We have a newcomer in the White House right now and look where it got us,' Klobuchar said.


Business executive Andrew Yang, who has run a cheerful campaign and drawn outsized crowds to his economy-infused message, has limited time left to make an impact. 
'Let me say, America, it's great to be back on the debate stage,' Yang, who is 44, said, referring to missing the qualifications for the previous debate. 'I'm so excited.'
More than they have in past debates, the candidates took issue with each other's records. Biden said Sanders should be held accountable for his votes against gun-control legislation "" and that it's not enough for him to claim that he was just representing constituents in a hunting-friendly state. 
'Bernie, while you were representing your constituency, an awful lot of people . . . in California, New York, Pennsylvania, they're getting killed by the thousands during the same period,' Biden said. 
Sanders said he has evolved on the issue. 'The world has changed and my views have changed,' he said.
The group of mostly white candidates had one of its most extended discussions on race and criminal justice issues. The candidates squabbled over their past records, and comments from surrogates, with a focus on the black electorate that will dominate South Carolina's Feb. 29 primary. 
Steyer, 70, twice pressed Biden to apologize for what he and some supporters considered to be racist comments made by one of Biden's top supporters in South Carolina. (Biden said the supporter, state senator Dick Harpootlian, was sorry.) Biden then urged Sanders to answer for comments made in a South Carolina newspaper by one of his supporters made about his history on matters of race. ('Joe Biden is a friend of mine and I'm not here to attack him,' Sanders said).
Buttigieg, who has struggled for support among minority voters, was asked about racial disparities in the criminal justice system in South Bend during his tenure "" in particular, the increase in arrests of black citizens for marijuana possession.
'We adopted a strategy that said drug enforcement would be targeted in cases where there was a connection to the most violent group or gang connected to a murder. These things are all connected, but that's the point,' he said.
Warren was then asked whether Buttigieg's answer was substantial enough.
'No,' she said. 'You have to own up to the facts.'

Women running for president still face deeply ingrained biases, says cultural critic

Unproductive, garbled narratives about gender and power gripped the Democratic presidential primary campaign in recent days. Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton blasted her 2016 rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.): 'Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done,' she told the makers of an upcoming Hulu documentary, and in a Hollywood Reporter interview, she called out 'his online Bernie Bros and their relentless attacks on lots of his competitors, particularly the women.' That came just after a very public fight between Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) over a conversation they had during a private dinner in 2018. Warren claims that Sanders told her a woman could not beat President Trump. Sanders denies it. Their antagonism migrated online, where two hashtags, #NeverWarren and #WarrenIsASnake, quickly trended. 
But both incidents, ultimately, have less to do with whether Sanders is sexist than with how persistently and profoundly uncomfortable many Americans are with the idea of any woman seeking power "" especially as president. 
One of the ways Warren's opponents disparage her is by attempting to portray her as Clintonesque; she's being 'Hillaried,' a term coined the moment Warren entered the race. As the field narrows and competition intensifies, supporters of Warren's rivals have sought to associate her with the 'establishment,' painting her as a corporate shill, an out-of-touch elitist, a plodding technocrat, a greedy lawyer "" a backstabbing, untrustworthy woman whose individual ambition is harmful to the greater cause of defeating Trump. Republican and Democratic activists alike have used her bungled attempts to address the harm done by her claim of Native American ancestry to tap into long-standing 'lying Hillary' narratives.-
No one can argue in good faith that Warren and Clinton are exactly the same in their personal attributes and behaviors, political positions or policy ambitions. They are both lawyers, and both served in the Senate. But for the majority of her public political life, Warren has consistently been far to the left of Clinton. Where Clinton was accused of palling around with wealthy donors, Warren has relentlessly outlined how she would break up their monopolies, regulate their industries and shrink wealth disparities favoring the ultrarich. The two women have strikingly different theories of power, which shows in their choices of words, advisers and policies. 
The most significant point of comparison between them "" and one of the only ways they are actually alike "" is that they share the experience of being highly ambitious women who chose to try to lead the country. 
That overlap is exactly where and why the question of Sanders's 'sexism' becomes such a political and cultural flash point. 'Sexism' can describe a very broad array of discriminatory beliefs and behaviors, some obvious, most not. The Pew Research Center found that almost half of American women have personally experienced gender discrimination, and extensive
research indicates how profoundly gender and race shape women's economic lives and well-being. But most men believe that sexism is a thing of the past. (For that matter, a new CNN poll released Wednesday found that while most voters believe a woman could be elected president, twice as many women as men say isn't possible, probably reflecting their differing levels of appreciation of the obstacles women face.) Sanders is not among those men: He acknowledges that sexism is real. But like many people, he seems to recognize only the most hostile and aggressive forms, ignoring the harms of bias, ambivalence and persistent trivialization. 
In Sanders's case, sexism is less about what he has done, said or understood "" and more about what he hasn't done, said or understood. He has, for example, a progressive voting record on abortion rights in the Senate, but he's rejected abortion rights-as a-litmus test-for Democratic candidates. He hasn't, in other words, taken reproductive justice seriously enough. He claims to be aware of the problems women face, yet he also indicates through his words and actions that those problems may not merit his attention. His recent retracted endorsement of Democratic House candidate and leftist podcast host Cenk Uygur is a good example. Uygur's history of rating women and making grossly sexist comments should have disqualified him from Sanders's endorsement in the first place, regardless of his politics. Last weekend, when asked if he thought gender presents a meaningful problem for female candidates, Sanders answered, 'Everybody brings some negatives,' and then cited his own age and Pete Buttigieg's youth as additional examples. 
Despite his decades in office fighting the 'status quo,' Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign was forced to address a lack of diversity in staffing, gender-pay inequities and bungled management of staffer-sexual misconduct. Sanders has-apologized-to the women affected and committed to 'do better,' but when pressed to explain how he missed these problems, he responded, 'I was a little bit busy running around the country.'
This sort of sexism isn't a blunt hostility that's easy to notice and criticize. It's negligence and forgetfulness. It lives in negative space. This is why Sanders and his supporters "" who are, some polling indicates, mostly women "" are dumbfounded, whether in 2016 or today, by allegations that he might be a sexist or might have behaved in sexist ways. On the contrary, they argue, he has been a lifelong supporter of women's rights, sees women as equals and calls himself a feminist. The focus of this defense is on how Sanders behaves, what he believes, how he feels and what his intent is. 
But sexist biases operate free of intent, and they have impact regardless of whether people mean them to. These apologias look past how the women running against him interact with him and his campaign, the media and culture more broadly. This understanding of sexism "" tied to what one individual does "" denies the subtle complexities of sexism as a structural force, the role it plays in propping up misogyny and the ways men are privileged by these dynamics. Warren and Clinton, like other female candidates, have had to navigate this environment without seeming whiny or demanding or, worse still, 'victims,' a reviled term that smacks of weakness and vulnerability. 
Misogyny isn't about individual sexism but how women experience the world, as philosophy professor Kate Manne argued in her groundbreaking book, 'Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny.' We need to understand misogyny as systemic hostility that includes punishing women for 'not conforming to gendered roles and expectations,' she wrote. In the past, misogyny was largely defined as the hatred of women, an essential component of which was the persistent exclusion of women from positions of respect and power. Even women deeply entrenched in the status quo, those who curry and most benefit from racism and xenophobia, are subject to sexism, misogyny and patriarchal regulation. 
The penalties women face are seamlessly part of the culture "" resident in social habits and gender roles, economic incentives, traditional mores, and more. So are the rewards that accrue to men who, conversely, experience misogyny as patriarchal entitlement.
The #WarrenIsASnake hashtag is a good example. It brought back memories of how long it took Sanders in 2016 to disavow the toxic contingent of his supporters whom Clinton recalled this month. Serpent imagery is particularly tied to age-old perceptions of power and gender. The Bible's association of Eve with the Devil in the form of a snake was a deliberate renunciation of powerful female divinities whose wisdom was symbolized by serpents, such as the Egyptian goddess Hathor, the Minoan snake goddess and Astarte, the consort of the Canaanite god Baal. The story, connecting women with a dangerous and cunning knowledge, demonized the serpent and the woman in tandem to rationalize a distribution of power that favored men. Online mobs may not be immersed in biblical hermeneutics, but because of such deep cultural legacies, a snake emoji is a cheap and easy sexist code. None of the current Democratic candidates would call a woman a serpent, but male candidates' chances improve when others do, demonstrating the sexism and bias that studies have found to hurt female candidates. Is it sexist to tolerate other people's sexism when it benefits you? We live in a world of sexism, diffuse and subtle, without sexists.
In this context, calling out sexism becomes treacherous. Each woman has to decide what her strategy will be. After the Sanders-Warren squabble, for example, more than 100,000 small-dollar donors contributed $1.7 million to Sanders, a record for his campaign, in what the press called a show of support against her claims of sexism. But if that loyalty is a material reward for Sanders, Manne's analysis holds that it was also a material penalty for Warren. 
The punishment that Manne sees as a key dimension of misogyny is essential to maintaining a patriarchal social order. Is it sexist to ignore the fact that our social order is patriarchal? Sanders inspires millions of people. His supporters are as diverse as any candidate on the left could want. His policy agenda "" from health care to climate change "" will improve women's lives. Over a long career, he has consistently pursued progressive political ideals, and in the past five years, he has positively and irrevocably altered American political debate. But all of this has happened within a virtually uncontested patriarchal framework. 
No critique of 'the establishment' is genuine without an explicit call to dismantle systemic patriarchy. While Democratic candidates across the board are now more comfortable calling out white supremacy, they are not at ease combining those ideas and saying 'white male supremacy' when referring to their own field. But how else can you describe the winnowing of the most diverse group of presidential candidates in the nation's history to an almost all-white field of 12, with just three women "" all of whom are now considered less likely to win than the men? If only half of the nine men still in the race had chosen to throw their skills, money and influence behind a woman instead of running themselves, this would not be the case. 
Individual acts of sexism did not determine the outcome of the last election, but cultural misogyny almost certainly did. For the first time ever, Sanders leads in CNN's national poll. Being accused of sexism doesn't seem to have hurt him; it may, in fact, have helped.

With polls close, he hopes to woo moderates "" and some Republicans

DES MOINES "" A year ago, then-South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg took his first trip to Iowa as a presidential candidate. He had barely any staff, so he piled in a car with his husband and a couple of early hires to drive the 400 miles west.
Now, with just weeks until the caucuses, Buttigieg's Iowa staff numbers in the hundreds, along with scores of volunteers eager to knock on doors and phone-bank. He regularly draws big crowds. And his fundraising haul has enabled him to blanket the state with TV ads touting him as the candidate who can bring the country together after President Trump.
Still, it is far from clear he will be able to turn his momentum into a win on caucus night. A recent Des Moines Register poll showed Buttigieg in a near-tie with former vice president Joe Biden and Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Voters "" even those who like him "" are worried about his inexperience, electability and struggles with black voters.
In this unusually fluid race, with a high number of undecided voters, Buttigieg acknowledges that he needs an Iowa win to prove he can win nationally. Foreign policy has abruptly vaulted to the forefront of voters' concerns, and Buttigieg has less of a clear fallback than some of his rivals should he stumble in the caucuses.
'Iowa is very important because it's our opportunity to demonstrate our strength to a lot of voters I think are very pragmatic "" in places like South Carolina and Nevada "" who above all want to see a candidate who can win,' Buttigieg said Saturday in Las Vegas.
To try to bring home a victory, Buttigieg is sweeping across Iowa this week, making at least 12 town-hall stops, including 10 in counties Trump carried in 2016. The campaign prioritized red and purple counties in two trips through Iowa in late December, too.
It is part of his strategy to pitch himself as a moderate who would not alienate conservatives, even as he argues his proposals would make him the most progressive president in recent memory.
The message he has delivered in Iowa lately makes clear overtures to disgruntled Republicans "" or what he calls 'future former Republicans' "" whom he argues he can attract. He suggests he will be able to build bipartisan consensus. And he, more than any candidate in the field, suggests that Republicans have co-opted faith, arguing that religious Americans can find a like-minded leader in him.
There are signs that moderates are responding to that message. Longtime Iowa Democratic Party activist Terri Hale, who endorsed Buttigieg last summer and calls him 'a realistic progressive,' recently planned a small meet-and-greet for Buttigieg at her home near Des Moines.
She invited only undecided and Republican acquaintances, to try to sell them on her candidate. 'We ended up having to move it to a bigger place because we had about 170 people,' Hale said. 'Not everybody there was an undecided or Republican, but I know a few Republicans for sure who are going to caucus for Democrats because of Pete who were there.'
The campaign is also doubling down on its robust organizing operation in the final weeks before the vote. Though Buttigieg started far behind his Democratic rivals in building a ground game "" waiting until around Labor Day to begin opening field offices "" he has now assembled one of the largest operations in the state.
According to several Democratic county chairs, Buttigieg's operation is second only to Warren's. 'When you see a Warren organizer, a Buttigieg organizer usually isn't far behind,' said one Democratic county chair, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to give a candid assessment of the race.
But that may not be enough. In recent weeks, some county chairs have sensed shifting feelings about Buttigieg.
Voters who had been leaning toward or even committed to him have reported new anxiety, raising questions about his age, his lack of Washington experience and his struggle to win over minority voters.
'I honestly think he peaked a little bit too early, unfortunately, and people are kind of having buyer's remorse,' the Democratic county chair said of Buttigieg. 'The second-guessing is starting. I think a big part of it is foreign policy, which is now becoming a huge issue in this election, which none of us expected. And that does play to Joe Biden's strength, and in many ways they are in the same lane.'
While Buttigieg seemed to benefit in the fall from heavy spending on television, he has lost that advantage. In recent weeks, his ads have been matched almost one-to-one by Biden spots, including a new ad emphasizing Biden's foreign policy experience against the backdrop of recent tensions with Iran.
Interviews with undecided voters at candidate events in recent days suggest there is still a lot of goodwill for Buttigieg and that he remains in consideration. But many still are not convinced.
'He's too young,' said Lynn Muhs, 67, an undecided voter from Newton, Iowa. She spoke after attending a Sanders rally Saturday as part an effort to see all the candidates in person before making a final decision on whom to support.
She praised Buttigieg as a 'good talker, a good speaker,' but she worried about his lack of Washington experience. In the past, she said, she thought an outsider might have been good. But she looks at that question differently considering Trump. Whoever follows Trump, she said, needs to be able to restore order.
'I could imagine him as someone who could win later down the road, but . . . he doesn't have the background and he doesn't have the experience, not in federal government anyway,' Muhs said. 'Being a small-town mayor, I mean, even if he were a large-town mayor, to me that is still not the same thing. You need that experience.'
To combat those worries, Buttigieg and his team are encouraging their volunteers to reach out to their friends and neighbors. The campaign flew its national caucus director, Travis Brock, to conduct some trainings in person. Buttigieg organizers are teaching precinct captains how to build 'empathetic bridges' to supporters of other campaigns in the hopes of bolstering their ranks on caucus night.
At a recent precinct captain training in Ankeny, north of Des Moines, a Buttigieg staffer reminded the 90 people gathered not to take an Iowa win for granted. One slide from a PowerPoint presentation showed a list of polls from this point in the 2004 Democratic election, when Howard Dean was leading. John F. Kerry went on to win Iowa, a surprise comeback that helped him clinch the Democratic presidential nomination.
'They were dating Howard Dean, and they married John Kerry,' Shannon Sankey, a Buttigieg organizer overseeing Ankeny, told the group. The race now, she said, is just as fluid. 'The polls are always lying to us,' she said. 'You never want to believe a poll, because it's always changing.'
Around the room, volunteers, many wearing navy-and-gold Buttigieg campaign pins, grew serious. Their game faces were on.
'We're focusing on persuasion and mobilization,' said Matt McCoy, a former state senator and early Buttigieg endorser who is involved in Buttigieg's Iowa 'kitchen cabinet,' a regular strategy meeting of staffers and other campaign members.
McCoy said the campaign still sees plenty of time to change minds. His preferred candidate agrees.
'What we're seeing is everything from voters who have been coming out to events for a year and are narrowing down their choices to people who are just now tuning in,' Buttigieg said Saturday. 'The message won't change, because my values haven't changed. But you will see us continuing to build toward a closing argument that really brings home why I'm the best nominee to defeat Donald Trump and why I'd be the best president.'

How many candidates are still in this for the Democrats?

Even longtime campaign reporters have to pause and silently count on their fingers whenever the question comes up. As of this writing, a dozen Democrats are still running for president.

Not all of them will be on every state's ballot. For example, billionaire Mike Bloomberg, a former mayor of New York, entered the race in November, and immediately said he would skip the early nominating states to focus on Super Tuesday states and beyond "" to the grumbling of some voters and party officials in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.
Is President Trump guaranteed to be the Republican nominee?
With all due respect to Republican challengers such as Joe Walsh and Bill Weld, President Trump will almost certainly be the Republican presidential nominee.
Some states, including Arizona, Nevada and South Carolina, have canceled their GOP primaries or caucuses, citing an opportunity to save taxpayer money in the face of, they say, an inevitable Trump win. Of course, with Trump's impeachment trial underway in the Senate, there's always a chance that the Republican nominee could end up being someone other than Trump.
What about third-party candidates?

How much time do you have?

On the Democratic side, what are the story lines we should be watching as the voting begins? Why pay attention to Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire and South Carolina "" four states without a lot of delegates?
The ultimate 'story line,' of course, is which Democratic candidate emerges from the primary with the majority of the party's 3,979 pledged delegates, making him or her the party's nominee to challenge Trump in this fall's general election.
It's true that the four early-nominating states account for only 155 delegates, or less than 4-percent of the total. But traditionally, a win in Iowa "" the first state to caucus, on Feb. 3 "" can turbocharge a campaign and convince nervous voters that a particular candidate is electable.
Having a strong showing in Iowa has been a clear priority for some Democrats, such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.); Pete Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Ind.; and businessman Andrew Yang. Others, including former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) have tried to play down the importance of Iowa and New Hampshire, focusing in turn on a longer-haul national race. Bloomberg, as mentioned earlier, is skipping the first four nominating states entirely. 
What is Super Tuesday, and what should we be looking for on that day? Are there other days with large numbers of delegates at stake?
'Super Tuesday' "" Tuesday, March 3 "" is the day that 14 states will vote in Democratic primaries, and 1,357 of the pledged delegates are up for grabs. That makes up one-third of the total available pledged delegates, and it has the potential to shift the race.
The Super Tuesday states include Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia. American Samoa will also hold a Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday, while some Democrats living abroad will be able to vote starting March 3.
There are other dates on which multiple states vote and large numbers of delegates are at stake, but none has as catchy a nickname.
On Tuesday, March 10, 352 delegates will be up for grabs from Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington.
On Tuesday, March 17, Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio will vote, awarding 577 delegates.
And on Tuesday, April 28, voters in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island will decide how 663 delegates are divvied up.
How long will it all last? Is it possible that we will not know who the Democratic nominee is when the convention begins? What are 'superdelegates,' and do they still exist after 2016?
Democratic primaries in states and U.S. territories will stretch into early summer; the last one will be held in the U.S. Virgin Islands on June 6, when seven delegates will be awarded. Presumably the Democratic nominee "" the person with a clear majority of pledged delegates "" will be clear by then. Or clearer, at least.
Or not clear at all! It is possible, especially if few candidates drop out along the way, that no one will have more than half of the pledged delegates by the time the Democratic National Convention is held in mid-July.
In that case, myriad scenarios could play out: For instance, on the first vote, pledged delegates "" who can technically vote for whomever they want "" could align themselves differently from their statewide distribution numbers, perhaps based on behind-the-scenes dealmaking between the campaigns.

There will still be 'superdelegates' "" mostly party insiders "" who can vote at the Democratic convention, but under new Democratic National Committee rules, they will do so only if a second round of ballots is required.
How long will the process last? Well, technically, the beauty of living in a democracy means that the next election cycle is never far away. 
We'll do this all again in four years.

On Monday night, Chris Matthews gathered with the crew of his long-running MSNBC show ""Hardball,"" his family and the network's president, Phil Griffin, at the suburban outpost of a chain steakhouse to say goodbye to the show he had hosted for more than 20 years and the cable-news era he helped create.
There were toasts and bittersweet tributes over dinner at the Capital Grille in Chevy Chase, Md. - all of it put together at the last minute, and nearly a year sooner than anyone anticipated. 
Two days earlier, after hours of conversation, Griffin had delivered the rough news: It was time for Matthews to step down. 
That was the prompt for Matthews's startling on-camera speech at the start of ""Hardball"" Monday. In an abrupt, live two-minute sign-off speech, Matthews stunned his audience on the eve of one of the most consequential political days of the 2020 campaign by announcing that he was resigning - and apologizing for a history of inappropriate comments about women.
Though the announcement followed a week of on-air gaffes, the suddenness of it shocked many inside his network, who followed up with misty testimonials to this most vivid of cable hosts: ""A real person who truly loves & knows politics,"" tweeted morning news anchor Stephanie Ruhle. ""I appreciate all that he has taught me."" Correspondent Steve Kornacki, tapped to host the rest of the ""Hardball"" hour after Matthews left the set, choked back tears on camera as he described Matthews as ""human . . . one of the highest compliments I can pay to someone.""
But the humanity of the bombastic Matthews was his undoing as his definitional character - a host without a filter - finally caught up to him. 
""Each time he went on air,"" said a person familiar with Griffin's conversation with Matthews, ""he was at risk for saying something that was not okay."" 
Matthews, 74, had a serious conversation with Griffin about his eventual retirement back in early 2019, before the presidential election cycle shifted into high gear. Matthews had made it known that he yearned to start getting home before 9 p.m. to have dinner with his wife, according to a person familiar with the discussions who like others requested anonymity to speak about private communications.
The network considered moving Matthews's show to an earlier time slot but in the end, he stayed where he was, with the plan to retire after the 2020 election. That timing would have given management plenty of time to figure out his replacement in the crucial 7 p.m. slot just before prime time. 
But embarrassments in recent weeks changed all that - and put Matthews in the position of having to jump before he was pushed, according to three people familiar with the conversation.

Last week, Matthews apologized for comparing Sen. Bernie Sanders's victory in the Nevada Democratic caucuses to the Nazi invasion of France. He also was criticized for an interview with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in which he expressed incredulity that Warren would take the word of a female employee who sued former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, alleging he told her to ""kill"" her unborn child. ""You believe he is lying?"" Matthews gasped.
Then, on Friday, Matthews misidentified Democrat Jaime Harrison, mistaking him for another black South Carolina politician, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.).
The coup de grace came that same day, when journalist Laura Bassett published an essay in GQ alleging that Matthews made boorish comments (""Why haven't I fallen in love with you yet?"") to her and other women when they were guests on his show. The piece reawakened old whispers about Matthews's serial insensitivity and inappropriate behavior - claims NBC News has quietly been defending him against for decades. NBC is particularly sensitive to harassment allegations these days, given its pledges to employees to not tolerate the type of crass sexual exploitation for which longtime ""Today"" anchor Matt Lauer was dismissed in 2017. 
All of that led Griffin to head to Matthews's house in Chevy Chase on Saturday to discuss Matthews's departure. Matthews's wife, Kathleen, a former longtime television reporter and public relations executive, was present for the ""difficult"" conversation, according to two people familiar with the meeting, during which Matthews's departure became inevitable. The discussion continued Sunday over the phone to determine what exactly to say, and when. 
Matthews was not pleased, but he came to accept the outcome. During the conversation, Griffin made clear the window was closing on Matthews to leave the network in a way that would allow him to go on air, talk about his departure, and set the timing and terms, according to two people familiar with the conversation.



Matthews's long Washington career represented a bridge from the old school of public affairs programming to the brash, conflict-charged arena of today's cable news.
A native of Philadelphia but a creature of Capitol Hill - his first job in Washington was as a Capitol Police officer - he wrote speeches for President Jimmy Carter and battled the Reagan White House as press secretary for Democratic House Speaker Tip O'Neill before moving into print journalism as a columnist for the San Francisco Examiner and the San Francisco Chronicle.
Matthew got his on-camera start as a regular fill-in panelist in the early days of ""The McLaughlin Group,"" along with the likes of Lawrence O'Donnell, another young Hill staffer who would also eventually make his way to MSNBC. The show, launched by Jesuit priest-turned-Republican operative John McLaughlin in 1982, turbocharged the once-sedate tradition of punditry debate panels. And Matthews had a style - shouty, combative, glib, pointed - perfectly suited for this new kind of discussion. It was, in essence, what cable news would eventually become.
Matthews's first show, ""Politics With Chris Matthews,"" aired on the short-lived Roger Ailes-created, NBC-owned America's Talking channel, which was eventually subsumed in 1996 by the new MSNBC. His show moved over to CNBC, where it was renamed ""Hardball,"" and then moved to MSNBC, where it aired every night for two decades.
The show was freewheeling and unpredictable. ""It turned him into one of the first cable news stars,"" said Jon Klein, former president of CNN, in an interview. ""Hardball"" was one of the early cable shows, such as CNN's ""Crossfire"" and ""Capital Gang,"" that were unabashedly Beltway-centric, inviting viewers to experience a raucous and irreverent conversation about the corridors of political power. 
""Viewers always wondered what would come out of his mouth next. He was kind of like Tim Russert on molly,"" Klein said. Matthews rarely dwelled on any single idea for very long, and he famously cut off guests before they could even begin to answer a question. Antsy, agitated and loose-lipped, he was a dramatic counterpart to the smooth and controlled news anchors of the old days.
Over the years, Matthews didn't change much. Instead, cable news became more like him. 
His volatility continued off-camera. In 1999, a female employee told CNBC executives that Matthews had made inappropriate jokes and comments at her expense and in the presence of others. The company investigated and found that Matthews's conduct was inappropriate and offensive, though it concluded that he wasn't propositioning the woman, according to reports from the Daily Caller eventually confirmed by the network. He received a formal reprimand, and the woman got a separation package with an undisclosed amount of money. 
On camera, Matthews opened himself up to charges of sexism - in particular for the loaded terms he used to critique Hillary Clinton. Matthews called her ""witchy,"" a ""she-devil"" and ""Madame Defarge,"" a reference to the vindictive, villainous knitting-woman of ""A Tale of Two Cities."" In 2005, he questioned whether troops would take orders from her as president; in 2008 he argued that ""the reason she's a U.S. senator, the reason she's a candidate for president, the reason she may be a front-runner is her husband messed around."" He later apologized. He also once pinched her cheek after an interview.
Linda Vester, who worked at NBC in the 1990s and accused Tom Brokaw of inappropriate advances, expressed concern that Matthews's retirement would end discussion of whether he had treated other women inappropriately. ""It's essential that NBC News fully and independently investigate him,"" she said. ""The issue is getting the full truth out in the open, understanding how it happened within the corporate culture."" 
While Kornacki appeared emotional and stunned as he took over the remaining 58 minutes of ""Hardball,"" he had known since Monday morning, the eve of Super Tuesday, that he would be sitting in for Matthews that night. 
Griffin had also told the other prime-time hosts who appear after Matthews every night that their longtime colleague would be gone. But for almost everyone else at MSNBC, they knew nothing of this major personnel change - until Matthews himself announced it at 7 p.m.

We see Sanders and Bloomberg not as Jews but as Americans, says journalist


On Feb. 18, Bloomberg News published an article with the headline ""Bloomberg Campaign Says It's a Two-Man Race for the Nomination."" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.)
tweeted the link
with the caption, ""It's almost as if he owns the media."" Cruz was trying to point out that the flattering headline appeared in an outlet that former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg owns, rendering its judgment suspect. But in replacing a demonstrative pronoun (""this media"") with a definite article (""the media""), Cruz skidded from a true statement (Mike Bloomberg does own Bloomberg News) into an old anti-Semitic stereotype about Jews controlling the - or really all - media.


It might have seemed like a harbinger of what's to come: This Democratic primary contest is, after all, a historic race for American Jews. The other man in the ""Two-Man Race for the Nomination"" is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), an avowed socialist and another Jew, who looks like the front-runner after coasting through the first three contests, itself a historic feat for a Jewish candidate. The faceoff between the Jewish billionaire and the Jewish socialist is the most Jewish political moment in American history, and
predictions
have
abounded
that a wave of hatred is about to hit as the two gain steam, evoking mythological anti-Semitic creatures to rapacious anti-Semites: The Elder of Zion and the Judeo-Bolshevik in a race for control of America! The Daily Stormer headlines write themselves.

I'm not as worried. To me, Cruz's infelicitous tweet read like the kind of unfortunate mistake you make when you forget someone is Jewish, rather than when you target them for it. While Jews may see two 78-year-old Jewish men running against each other (arguing about who's had more stents and who has more houses, like at the kiddush in a Conservative shul), that's not how America writ large perceives this race. Sanders and Bloomberg are barely registering in mainstream politics as Jewish. It's a remarkable, final gift from
the goldeneh medinah
- the golden land, as Yiddish-speaking immigrants once called the United States - at a time when American Jews have never needed it more. 
Take, for example, the recent
vandalism of Bloomberg's campaign offices with epithets including ""racist,"" ""sexist,"" ""oligarch"" and ""corporate pig."" Yes, Bloomberg is Jewish, and yes, some of the insults were about his wealth, but none of the graffiti was anti-Semitic. The hatred seemingly fueling the vandalism was based on class warfare, not race or religion; the vandals clearly didn't target Bloomberg as a Jew but as a billionaire, and well, they apparently believe it's time to ""
Eat the Rich
,"" as they spray-painted on the Flint, Mich., headquarters. 
The vandalism is just the most extreme example of something true across the board when it comes to Bloomberg: Most of the criticism he faces, aside from censure over the racist stop-and-frisk policy he instituted as mayor, focuses on his staggering wealth and how he's used it to buy power and influence. That is a familiar Jewish stereotype, yet it's not anti-Semitic in this case because Bloomberg's Jewishness is completely irrelevant; he's accused of these things not because he's Jewish but because he's Bloomberg. Anti-Semitic canards are based on generalizations and myths. This critique is specific.
Sanders, too, seems to exist in the American imagination independent from his Jewishness. Take the
myriad
articles
exploring his popularity among Latinos, many of whom call him Tío Bernie, the articles tell us,
despite the fact
that he is a ""white, 78-year-old senator from Vermont."" The mystery these articles seek to solve is never how young Latinos could identify with an old Jew or even an old white Jew, but how they could identify with an old white guy and how they came to claim him as one of their own. The narrative erases Sanders's Jewish identity.
They're not the only ones. The controversial radio host Joe Rogan, whose approval of Sanders the campaign turned into an ad, apparently
had no idea
that Sanders was Jewish. His critics, too, seem to focus
almost
exclusively
on
seeing him
as too far to the left, portending bread lines and class warfare - accusations that are completely separate from his Jewish identity. 
In Sanders's two campaigns for president, the only anti-Semitic episode I can recall involved an unfortunate
article in Politico
that depicted him in an illustration standing next to a tree of $100 bills and quoted someone calling him cheap; it was another accidental slur that seemed to come from overlooking Sanders's heritage rather than attacking it - like Cruz's tweet, or when Chris Matthews compared Sanders's victory in the Nevada caucuses last weekend to the Nazis marching into France. (""I'm sorry for comparing anything from that tragic era in which so many suffered, especially the Jewish people, to an electoral result in which you were the well-deserved winner,"" a contrite Matthews said in an
apology
a few days later.)
And though a debate question Tuesday night sought to tie Sanders's potential to be the first Jewish president to his
decision to skip
the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's annual conference, the connection was strained (which Sanders seemed to realize; after noting that he is ""very proud of being Jewish,"" he quickly pivoted to a broader critique of U.S. Middle East policy).
None of this is to say that Sanders isn't Jewish enough, a noxious idea floating around far-right Jewish circles. His Jewish identity, rooted in the evil of the Holocaust and the murder of his father's family by the Nazis, chimes with that of many American Jews, and I believe him when he says he is proud to be Jewish.
But the fact that Sanders and Bloomberg are Jewish is something Americans barely seem to notice about them; it's simply receded into the background of their bids for the presidency. Each candidate has been allowed to bring his Jewishness to the fore exactly as often as he would like and not a jot more. 
This is an amazing fact, the true revolutionary aspect of this election cycle. In the parlance of our times, you might say they're demonstrating that most coveted of American commodities: white privilege. Sanders and Bloomberg are able to simply blend into the mostly old, mostly male, mostly white Democratic field. That didn't happen for Cory Booker or Kamala Harris, or for Julián Castro or Andrew Yang, or for Elizabeth Warren, or Hillary Clinton in 2016, for that matter. For women and other minorities, race and gender are still inseparable from public persona. They don't get to decide how they are seen; America sees them first and foremost as women or black or Latino or Asian.
Not so for white Jewish men anymore. The America that accepted Joe Lieberman keeping kosher and observing Shabbat
on the campaign trail
in 2000 has gone a step further: In 2020, amid a rise in anti-Semitic vandalism and violence, two white Jews are able to run not on the Jewishness that unites them but on what distinguishes them from each other - which, because God has a sense of humor, is their approach to money. 
It turns out that in addition to gifting Jews the right to practice their religion freely, America had one more gift: the right to make our Jewishness disappear to our fellow citizens. 
We have a long way to go to ensure that the rest of America's minorities - including Jews of color and visibly Orthodox Jews - have the same choice. Still, there's something magical in the spectacle of two Jews fighting over money before a nation that sees only two Americans. It reflects the fulfillment of liberal democracy's promise: that it can ultimately grant a minority group full access to the rights and privileges of the majority, not by forcing them to abandon their identity but allowing them to choose how much to let it define them. When America lives up to its ideals, anyone can show up in the public sphere with just as much of their personal, religious, even national identity as they like, and no one - not the government, nor public opinion - can force a lick more of it onto them.
Because we are Jews, we naturally prepare for the worst. Many are already steeling themselves against the possibility of an anti-Semitic onslaught the likes of which we've never seen before,
declaring
this election cycle ""catnip to anti-Semites of every creed and color."" Certainly, it's possible that the Democratic primary race is a friendlier space for Jewish politicians than the general election will be; President Trump, after all, ran an
anti-Semitic ad
while running against Hillary Clinton, who isn't Jewish.

But I hope that in the midst of those preparations for the worst, we remember to stop and behold the wonder of this moment and recommit to ensuring that all Americans are granted the gifts America has bestowed upon us Jews in campaigns to come - swiftly and in our lifetimes.

Move by Va. former governor, DNC chair could show establishment support
The campaign of former vice president Joe Biden is making plans to recast him as the clear favorite of party leaders after his expected win Saturday in South Carolina, hoping to create momentum that will allow him to outperform moderate rivals on Super Tuesday and position him as the only viable alternative to Sen. Bernie Sanders. 
A major focus of the effort is securing endorsements from prominent Democratic figures before Tuesday, when 14 states cast their primary votes. Former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe has told associates he may endorse Biden on Sunday if Biden can pull off a strong first-place finish Saturday, according to a person familiar with McAuliffe's thinking. 
McAuliffe would join Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and former defense secretary and California congressman Leon Panetta. Both announced their support of Biden on Friday, hoping to give him a boost since Virginia and California both hold primaries March 3, also called Super Tuesday.
Their endorsements came shortly after that of Rep. James E. Clyburn, the most powerful Democrat in South Carolina, who announced Wednesday he was backing Biden. A person familiar with the Biden campaign's thinking said officials expect to see a stream of endorsements if Biden performs well in South Carolina.
The campaign's hope is to create the clear sense for voters that Biden is the consensus alternative among party leaders to Sanders (I-Vt.), a democratic socialist who some party leaders believe would have a narrower electoral college path against President Trump, potentially putting the Democratic House majority at risk and making it harder to recapture the Senate. 
""We're at an inflection point in this race and, as Joe Biden has said, he's not a socialist or a plutocrat - he's a Democrat,"" said Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman. ""The vice president's in very good company in that respect, and the stakes of beating Donald Trump in crucial battleground states are drawing them off the sidelines.""
A second Biden adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the campaign hopes the South Carolina result will mark a clear pivot in the race.
""We anticipate and hope to see momentum coming out of South Carolina, not just because we win, which we hope we will, but because we've put a damper on Bernie's momentum,"" that person said. ""No other candidate has shown an ability to put a stop on his momentum.""
There is little evidence that voters take their cues from the preferences of party elders. Rather, the Biden campaign's goal is to generate a sense of momentum and end a stretch of the campaign that has seen Sanders take a clear lead in the nomination fight, winning or coming close in the first three contests, while the party's centrists have been unable to rally around a single alternative.
Even if Biden prevails in South Carolina, however, he probably would struggle to catch up to Sanders. The senator from Vermont is polling strongly in many Super Tuesday states, including the big prize of California, forcing any would-be competitor to play catch-up. 
At a recent retreat for Senate Democrats in Baltimore, one participant described the mood as ""like a funeral"" because of concerns that Sanders is headed to the nomination. That person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions, said the broad expectation was that Biden would try to cast himself as the only person who could stop Trump's reelection if he wins big on Saturday. 
The other Democratic candidates are also preparing strategies to frame the South Carolina results, given the stakes the following Tuesday, when 34 percent of the party's convention delegates will be awarded. 
Sanders's campaign released a memo Friday describing him as ""by far - the candidate who is best positioned to defeat Donald Trump in the general election."" The memo appeared aimed at making the case that even if Sanders does not win Saturday, he remains the Democrats' best choice.
Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, whose steady rise in public polls has stalled since a disappointing debate performance in Nevada, said in an interview with MSNBC that he is committed to staying in the race ""as long as I have a chance."" 
""Yeah, I'm running a race, and I'm behind with one lap to go. What, am I going to quit? No, you run harder,"" Bloomberg said. 
Former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have been boosted by significant recent television advertising investments on their behalf by supportive super PACs, which can take unlimited donations but do not coordinate directly with the campaigns. A separate group backing Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) is spending money in key states such as Colorado. 
The Biden campaign has bought $2.2 million in broadcast and digital advertising across the Super Tuesday states, according to the campaign's data. The tracking firm Advertising Analytics reports that overall, Democrats have spent $247 million in advertising in the Super Tuesday states, driven by a massive investment by Bloomberg. 
After leading national polls for a year, Biden notched deeply disappointing performances in the first two contests, finishing fourth in Iowa and fifth in New Hampshire.
But after the Clyburn endorsement and a second-place finish in Nevada, Biden is now favored to win South Carolina, according to recent polls, although the size of his expected victory remains uncertain. His margin of victory will be a factor in McAuliffe's decision, said the person familiar with his thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. 
A Biden campaign spokesman declined to comment on McAuliffe, while a McAuliffe spokesman said the former governor ""has not made a decision on an endorsement.""
McAuliffe is an influential figure among Democratic leaders, and in some ways, he embodies the party establishment. McAuliffe chaired the Democratic National Committee and has close ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, holding top positions with their presidential campaigns. He also contemplated a presidential run himself this year.
He has been neutral in the race so far, although he held a fundraiser in November for Biden at his home in McLean. About 115 guests stood around McAuliffe's pool as the former governor described how Biden had helped Virginia as vice president, securing grants for the state and fighting to clean the Shenandoah River. 
""We've got to get America back to where people get along, where we have alliances around the world and everybody loves the United States of America,"" McAuliffe said, adding that Trump's ""insanity"" had led the country ""off the rails."" 
McAuliffe's wife, Dorothy, is backing Biden and is kicking off a get-out-the-vote event Saturday in Alexandria. At the November fundraiser she called Biden ""a great man,"" a ""great public servant"" and the Democrat who has ""the best chance of beating Donald Trump.""
Biden is scheduled to attend a rally at Booker T. Washington High School in Norfolk on Sunday evening, which could provide a platform for a McAuliffe announcement.

Senator could ease up on Biden, go all-in for the nomination, or drop out
Sen. Bernie Sanders has convened a series of weighty discussions about the future of his presidential campaign with his closest confidants, according to two people with direct knowledge of the conversations, and at least three potential paths forward have come up in the private talks.
One option that has been raised: Keep the campaign technically active with a goal of winning votes and accumulating delegates to the July nominating convention, but forgo attack ads aimed at delegate leader Joe Biden. Another: Stay in the race and aggressively compete for the nomination. A third choice: End the campaign. 
The people with knowledge of the talks spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive conversations. They cautioned that other options or nuances may also be on the table and stressed that Sanders (I-Vt.) had not yet made up his mind and was still trying to reach out to supporters. A campaign spokesman did not dispute their account. 
Few if any dilemmas in recent political history have been fraught with so many variables and such significant potential consequences. 
Before the coronavirus crisis, Democrats were anxious that disputes in the party would persist long into the general election, as they did after Sanders squared off against Hillary Clinton in 2016. That concern has only intensified as the pandemic has upended daily life across the globe, thrown the presidential race into uncertainty and created an urgent appetite for Democratic unity. 
With Biden staked to a solid lead and the future of the remaining primaries in doubt, many in the party are calling for Sanders to bow out, in recognition of the destructive divisions that could deepen if he sticks around. They are eager to pivot to a general election posture against President Trump and want to empower Biden to get started as soon as possible.
At 78, Sanders, a democratic socialist who long toiled on the fringes of the national political debate, might well be in his final national campaign. Unlike four years ago, when there was a clear incentive to keep running against Clinton and build a still-budding movement, he came into this race as a known entity with a proven following - making his current political aspirations less clear.
After suffering decisive losses in three more primaries Tuesday, and standing almost no chance of catching Biden in the race for the Democratic nomination, Sanders decided to return home to Vermont last week to assess his future. 
The senator is expected to reach a decision about the way forward in consultation with his wife and closest adviser, Jane Sanders. Campaign officials have signaled that he is not in any rush.
In a sign of how close Sanders is keeping his deliberations, even longtime friends and associates have said in recent days that they have little idea of where he will come down. Those with knowledge of the private discussions said the conversations have been substantive and thoughtful and that they reflect how intensely the senator is grappling with his options. 
Outside supporters have publicly suggested a range of different options, underlining the dilemma Sanders is confronting.
Larry Cohen, a close ally who helms a nonprofit aligned with the senator, is advocating that Sanders do three things: Push for mail-in balloting for the remaining primaries to curb the risk to voters from the coronavirus; stay in the race to accumulate enough delegates to influence the party platform; and forge a working conversation with Biden that acknowledges that the former vice president, not him, has the path to a majority of pledged delegates.
""Just a dialogue with Biden, not attacks,"" said Cohen.
RoseAnn DeMoro, a close Sanders friend and former nurses' union head, said Sanders should not approach the race as a done deal and ought to treat a come-from-behind victory in future contests as a possibility given the volatility of the times.
""I think there'll be openings that we don't know"" about, said DeMoro, warning that it would be foolish to concede to Biden.
Biden has made entreaties to Sanders and his supporters, embracing policies the senator has championed and nodding to his youthful movement in recent speeches. Aides from the two campaigns have been in close touch over the coronavirus, officials from both sides said recently, outlining a potential path for negotiations that could lead to an exit more acceptable to Sanders.
It's not clear he would take it, however. Sanders appears as keen as ever on using his platform to advance his own ideas about how to combat the impact of the coronavirus, as he did Friday evening when he convened a virtual discussion.
""This a moment that history will look back on and say: How did the people of the United States respond?"" Sanders said in his opening remarks. He has put forward a plan that draws on his longtime calls for a universal health care system and calls for sweeping new protections for working-class people.
On Saturday, Sanders continued to focus his campaign's energy on the coronavirus. As he took to social media to renew his calls for $2,000 emergency cash payments to help Americans cope with economic setbacks, the campaign broadcast online a live ""teach-in"" on the virus.
The campaign also announced that its robust fundraising operation was still churning, collecting more than $2 million in 48 hours for five charities trying to mitigate the effect of the virus.
Those close to the senator say that in recent days he has immersed himself in finding ways to address the crisis. Many of his supporters point to the economic and public health problems arising from it as justification for the far-reaching reforms he has long advocated.
In other words, they say, it's a moment that calls out for Sanders to stay onstage, not exit.
Some in the senator's orbit pointed out another potential thicket: the disconnect between the officials spearheading the campaign and the legions of fans who have powered a movement that started when he rose to prominence in the 2016 campaign. 
The two domains don't always operate on the same wavelength, and in this case, some feel, there is far more passion among average supporters for him to stick around than there is among the campaign professionals around him. 
On Saturday, Sanders was sounding like a candidate who was not yet ready to relinquish his platform to promote his ideas.
""Suspend evictions, foreclosures, and utility shut-offs nationwide,"" he tweeted.

Many of the most endangered Republicans have concluded that fully embracing President Trump is their only credible path to victory in November, rallying to his side in the final days of the Senate impeachment fight and indulging his most controversial actions and statements.
At-risk Republicans "" including those in battlegrounds such as Arizona, Colorado and Georgia "" are calculating that a strong economy and an energized pro-Trump base will be enough to carry the party as it works to retain the White House and its Senate majority in 2020, according to interviews and private discussions with more than a dozen Republican senators, Senate aides and veteran strategists and officials.
More broadly, most Republicans have also largely jettisoned plans to break ranks with Trump to woo independents and suburban women, who turned on the party in 2018 and helped hand the House to the Democrats. This political positioning is driven in part by their view that Democrats are again poised to nominate a uniquely vulnerable presidential standard-bearer weighed down with ideological or establishment baggage.
'There's nothing in the middle of the road other than dead possums and yellow lines,' said Will Ritter, co-founder of Poolhouse, a center-right ad agency. 'Like no other president before, Republican voters want you to wrap yourself around Trump. There is no upside to doing any distancing.'
Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) has concentrated in recent weeks on rallying base Republicans rather than appealing to moderates for her tough reelection fight, pushing for a swift acquittal in Trump's impeachment trial while raising money off a feud with a CNN reporter she called 'a liberal hack.' Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who is running for reelection in a state Hillary Clinton won by five points in 2016, came under attack by his likely Democratic opponent, former governor John Hickenlooper, after deciding against calling for impeachment witnesses and evidence this week.
And Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), facing a tough intraparty primary fight from Rep. Douglas A. Collins (R-Ga.), has gone all-in on supporting Trump in a state that Democrats are targeting for its growing diversity and booming Atlanta suburbs, including an attack this week on fellow Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) for supporting the call for witnesses.
Loeffler, who has been personally friendly with Romney and who has donated to him in the past, accused him in a tweet of trying to 'appease the left' and concluded: 'The circus is over. It's time to move on!'
Trump's uncontested grip over his party came into focus again Friday as two key Republican senators "" Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who is retiring, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who is not up for reelection "" supported the president by blocking Democratic attempts to extend the trial, couching their positions as driven by frustrations with Democrats. It will mark the first time in U.S. history that no witnesses will be called in a Senate impeachment proceeding.
'There is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the United States Constitution's high bar for an impeachable offense,' Alexander said in a statement, arguing that while Trump had taken 'actions that are inappropriate,' they did not merit his removal from office.
It was the most significant political move made by Senate Republicans this week: Their refusal to join Democrats in calling for additional evidence or witnesses in Trump's impeachment trial, ensuring that it could wrap up in the coming days.
At the center of the calculation was Trump himself, and just how much Republicans feel they can distance themselves from a president who, in just over three years, has traveled from troublesome outsider to Republican Party standard-bearer.
Ritter said some vulnerable Republicans running in swing states and House districts may be able to differentiate themselves from Trump and appeal to the center on specific policy issues, but on something hyper-politicized like impeachment, they cannot afford to cross the president.
'On Trump, it's binary,' Ritter said. 'You're either a treacherous Democrat or you're with the president.'
The 2018 midterm elections did provide a flashing alarm for Republicans about the risks of being inextricably bound with Trump. Democrats retook the House majority after toppling Republican incumbents in many suburban districts and in state and local races "" a takeover that laid the groundwork for impeachment.
Former Republican senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania said challenges in suburbs, such as those surrounding Philadelphia, remain troubling for the party. But he said opposing Trump on impeachment is seen by most at-risk Republicans as the 'wrong way to try to win over those voters.'
'You won't get seen as playing to the suburbs,' Santorum said. 'You'll be seen as playing to the angry leftists who hate the president.'
Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who as the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee worked to keep the probe of Russian election interference as bipartisan as possible, said he fully supports Trump and is surprised that anyone might be surprised.
'He's a Republican, he's president and we support his agenda,' Burr said. 'The media, of course, tries to drive a wedge and wonder, but every poll today shows the president actually stronger today than he was four years ago.'
For Trump, Republican unity on impeachment is the fruit of the ultimate pressure campaign in a short political career defined by them. The president has upended so many norms that he has simply become the norm, with everyone else in the party scrambling to adjust.
That doesn't mean Republicans all personally like Trump or cheer his conduct, either on foreign policy or other matters "" in fact, many Republican lawmakers still complain loudly about him behind closed doors, sometimes mocking him as incompetent and undisciplined.
But many also privately acknowledge that Trump dominates the party in a potent and visceral way and say they are operating out of the partisan reality of an intensely divided nation.
Democrats, they add, should stop expecting a Republican establishment to stand up and block Trump, since Trump himself is now the establishment.
'I regularly talk to five or six Republicans who I feel some closeness to,' said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). 'I've heard for months that they know the president lies a lot. . . . They worry about his character. But they aren't willing to come forward and say that publicly. That's one of the tragedies of this era.'
Former Republican Georgia congressman Jack Kingston said he once had reservations about Trump but has since become an ardent admirer and booster. He explained his transformation with a shrug, saying his party and Washington 'needed a shake-up.'
'I accept it,' he said.
The Georgia primary fight brewing between Loeffler and Collins is a classic Trump-era standoff, he added.
'Any GOP candidate is going to want to show he or she is close to Trump,' Kingston said. 'If you think about the Republican Party, he's the center of the orbit. You don't want him to say something bad about you.'
The impulse for Republicans to link themselves tightly to the president spans the country, and includes some lawmakers not even currently up for reelection. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who doesn't face reelection for four years, released a 30-second ad in Iowa that sided with Trump and attacked former vice president Joe Biden and other Democrats.
'I'd like to thank the Democrats for badly botching this impeachment charade and for spending so much time in a coverup for Joe Biden,' says Scott, who introduces himself as a juror in the Senate trial. 'The real story here is the corruption Joe Biden got away with.'
The ad goes on to levy a series of factually problematic charges against Biden and his son Hunter, but its mere existence is sure to delight Trump "" and sparked speculation that Scott is eyeing a 2024 presidential bid, seeking to cast himself as the torchbearer of Trump's brand.
Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general under Trump who is now running to retake the Alabama Senate seat he vacated to join the administration, is also pushing to prove his fealty to the president "" despite the fact that Trump, furious at Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, publicly and privately berated and humiliated his attorney general for the majority of his tenure.
Nonetheless, on Wednesday, Sessions touted his loyalty to Trump in a trio of tweets focused on former national security adviser John Bolton, whose forthcoming book directly ties Trump to the Ukraine decision at the heart of his impeachment trial. Sessions emphasized that he never publicly criticized the president and dismissed Bolton's memoir as 'an act of disloyalty.'

Former senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said he understands if Republicans poke holes in the Democrats' case against Trump and vote for acquittal but cannot accept Republicans insisting that Trump did nothing wrong. Those who do the latter, he said, are willfully taking a position they know is false.
'That's the difference. Vote to acquit? Okay. You can make that argument. But to say this wasn't an egregious abuse of his presidential duty? That's where this party has problems,' Flake said. 'To suggest otherwise signals complete subservience to the president.'
But Scott Reed, senior strategist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, pointed to Trump's 'unprecedented high approval ratings with the GOP rank and file.'
'It's Trump's party now "" there's no way around that,' Reed said. 'You may not agree with the boxes, but he's checking all the boxes.'
Democrats, meanwhile, have had their own challenges holding their ranks together as Trump voters in red states have made clear to Democratic senators that they will pay a price for opposing the president.
Two centrists who won election last year "" Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) "" as well as Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.), who will face voters this year after a long-shot win in a special election in 2017, have been coy about how they will vote on acquittal, giving hope to Trump's allies that the president could win bipartisan support.
Many Republicans also believe that Trump stands a strong chance of reelection against a flawed Democratic opponent, whether a nominee from the left like Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) or Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), or a longtime politician like Biden.
Dick Wadhams, a longtime Republican strategist based in Colorado, said the specific choice between Trump and the eventual Democratic nominee will help Republicans who have tacked to the right to appease the party's base win over moderates, as well.
'It's going to be a choice on the ballot and not a referendum in 2020, and that's what makes this very different than 2018,' Wadhams said. He added that he was a begrudging Trump voter in 2016 but now is fully supportive. He pointed to Trump accomplishments like passing a tax cut and appointing conservative judicial nominees, as well as his concern about where the Democrats would take the country.
'I still have concerns about the way he behaves, his tweets drive me nuts, and a lot of Republicans feel that way, but at the same time "" Medicare-for-all, Green New Deal, killing fracking "" spare me,' he said, rattling off a list of liberal proposals. 'Democrats are driving people who might want to vote for them back to Trump.'

Pete Buttigieg said Wednesday he raised more than $24.7-million for his White House bid in the final three months of 2019, a haul that reflects his sustained financial strength in the Democratic primary field as candidates enter the final stretch before voting begins. 
His quarterly total is comparable to the $24.8-million he raised in the second quarter, an amount that helped elevate him from little-known mayor to serious presidential contender. In all, Buttigieg has raised roughly $76-million for his presidential bid. 
Buttigieg "" whose last day as mayor of South Bend, Ind., was Wednesday "" is the first candidate to release his fundraising figures after the Dec.-31 quarterly deadline. Candidates have until Jan.-31 to file fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission, but those with impressive figures typically share their totals soon after a quarter ends. 
It is unclear yet how much money Buttigieg's campaign has left to spend in the final weeks before the Feb.-3 Iowa caucuses and beyond, or how much money he drew from donors giving the maximum amount through private fundraisers "" a point of contention in the Democratic race in recent weeks. 
The Buttigieg campaign said Wednesday that it had received more than 2-million donations from more than 733,000 people in 2019, with 326,000 people giving in the final three months of the year, when his campaign gained steam in Iowa polls. 
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a leading fundraiser in the Democratic field who has built a massive financial operation fueled by low-dollar donors online, is also expected to post strong figures in the fourth quarter. The Sanders campaign said Wednesday that it had surpassed 5-million individual donations from people across the country, reaching a goal the campaign had set for the end of the quarter. 
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) announced last week that she had raised at least $17-million, asking her supporters to meet a goal of $20-million for the quarter. 
The campaign of Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) announced Tuesday that he eclipsed his third-quarter haul of $6-million. 
Buttigieg's campaign said it spent the fourth quarter of 2019 hiring its field staff, expanding staff size to more than 500 people and setting up 65 field offices in the early-voting states. 
'This quarter, Pete solidified himself as a top tier presidential candidate, not by tapping into the fundraising list or bank account of a sitting senator or someone who had run for president before, but by speaking to voters who for too long have been let down by politicians in Washington and are looking for a better path forward,' campaign manager Mike Schmuhl wrote in a memo Wednesday morning.
Buttigieg's overtures to wealthy donors at private fundraisers came under fire in recent weeks, in a fight with Warren over transparency and the role of the traditional donor class in financing political campaigns. 
In response, Buttigieg agreed to release his list of 'bundlers' "" those who funnel large sums of money to campaigns "" and began giving limited access to reporters to his private fundraisers. 
Fellow presidential contender Joe Biden, who has also relied on a high-dollar fundraising program, last week released the list of his bundlers. He has allowed limited access to his fundraisers since the beginning of his campaign. 
In the final week of December, Buttigieg's campaign held a fundraising contest challenging supporters to give the smallest unique donation amount. The contest generated more than 1,600 donations, the campaign said Tuesday.

I am a member of the Silent Generation. What's that, you ask? The other generations get noticed "" the Greatest Generation, the baby boomers, the Gen Xers, the millennials. People haven't heard of us. Maybe it's the name.
Americans often talk about the story of our country in terms of generations, but I don't recall that ever coming up in my favorite high school course, U.S. history. I offer my unsung age cohort and its political failures as a small addition to the next round of textbooks.
The Silent Generation includes everyone born after Dec. 31, 1927, and before Jan. 1, 1946. We are about 74 to 92 years old. You know us. We are garrulous aunts, uncles, grandmas and grandpas. How can people call us silent? Two of the most talkative presidential candidates are in our group: former vice president Joe Biden (D) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). We need a better label.

In this political year, I start with the fact that no member of the Silent Generation has ever been elected president. Sen. John F. Kerry (D), born in 1943, came closest in 2004. This is probably our last opportunity.
The other two members of our generation running this year are former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg (D) and former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld (R). The youngest of us, such as me born in 1945, will be 79 or close to that on Election Day 2024. It's Bernie, Bill, Joe or Mike in 2020, or forget about it.
Why have we missed that chance? Military service looks good in elections. We don't have much. Most of us reached draft age between the Korean and Vietnam wars. I joined the Army in 1967, but I was already the barracks geezer at 22, the oldest private in my basic training company.
The most important reason none of us has won the presidency is that we are so few. According to the Pew Research Center, our generation numbered just 30 million in 2015, much less than the better-known generations even before we started dying off. Pew said counting people alive in 2015, there were 75 million baby boomers (1946-1964), 66 million Gen Xers (1965-1976), 75 million millennials (1977 to 1995) and 69-million in Gen Z (1996 to now and still growing).

Our scarcity is what distinguishes us. The Great Depression and World War II kept our birthrates low. That is why the name of the generation immediately after ours celebrates nothing but the fecundity of their parents.
I feel sorry for the boomers, always getting teased. Being known for self-absorption and acquisitiveness is a burden. My wife, born in 1946, is of that generation. Like other elderly couples, we tweak each other. Recently, I inflicted on her a USA Today op-ed that said younger people were staying together longer, 'unlike the boomers who were obsessed with their own fulfillment in the '70s.'
That's unfair, of course. I'm not sure my generation is so great. How did we get that weird name in the first place?
Wikipedia says: 'As young adults during the McCarthy Era, many members of the Silent Generation felt it was dangerous to speak out. Time magazine first used the term 'Silent Generation' in a November 5, 1951, article titled 'The Younger Generation,' although the term appears to precede that publication.' Many experts suggest the label came from being raised in an era when children were seen and not heard. We might have been what President Richard Nixon called 'The Silent Majority.'

We have some admirable qualities. Kristan Wojnar, a financial adviser, said we are 'touted to be the healthiest, most educated and wealthiest elder generation to have ever lived.' She said, 'The Silent Generation believes in hard work and putting in long hours. They grew up in lean times and as a result, saved their hard-earned money.'
That's true of me. I wear my clothes until they're in tatters. When I was a child, my parents let me speak freely. But their experience of the Depression deeply colored my upbringing. It was a valuable inheritance.
We were born in hard times but became adults in good times. We had less competition for college spaces and jobs. Some scholars have suggested we be called the Lucky Generation.
That's all we have to offer. We're lucky. I am not recommending anybody of any generation running for president in 2020. But heading into the future, our country is going to need all the luck it can get.

As Joe Biden racked up a string of unexpected victories in Super Tuesday primaries, he began to stitch together the kind of political coalition that had eluded his candidacy for months: a broad assembly of voters with the collective power to potentially defeat President Trump in November.
Biden's strong showing among African Americans, suburbanites and moderate white voters - spanning geographical regions and drawing from a surge in turnout - boosted confidence among Democrats that the former vice president could soon win a Democratic race that voters have turned into a contest over which candidate is best positioned to beat Trump.
Biden, who won primaries in Texas, Virginia and eight other states Tuesday, alluded to his burgeoning coalition during his victory speech Tuesday night in Los Angeles.
""Our campaign reflects the diversity of this party and this nation, and that's how it should be,"" he told supporters. ""Because we need to bring everybody along, everybody. We want a nominee who will beat Donald Trump, but also keep Nancy Pelosi the speaker of the House, and win back the United States Senate.""
His surprise overnight elevation to delegate leader pleased moderate Democrats and unnerved some Republicans who had expected Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to come out in front after 14 states voted on Super Tuesday.
The results also harked back to the 2018 midterm elections, in which Democrats won back the House and prevailed in several competitive gubernatorial races by capitalizing on disdain for Trump among moderate and suburban voters, combined with high turnout among members of the Democratic base.
Rep. Joe Cunningham (D-S.C.), who flipped a Republican congressional seat in 2018, said Biden's string of victories was reminiscent of his win in a district containing the suburbs of Charleston.
""A lot of folks who came out and supported us are the same ones who came out and supported him,"" said Cunningham, who endorsed Biden.
In a campaign where electability has been a major theme, Biden has taken to calling himself an ""Obama-Biden"" Democrat and pledging to rebuild the kind of diverse electorate that helped former president Barack Obama secure two terms.
But with Sanders capitalizing on energetic crowds and support from many young voters, Obama's coalition has not fully rallied behind Biden, said Amy Walter, national editor of the Cook Political Report. While Biden has trailed Sanders among young people and Hispanic voters, he has quickly put together an emerging coalition that capitalizes on the strong anti-Trump sentiment among black voters and suburban women, she said.
""Every campaign should have its own coalition that is organic for the candidate and is the right coalition for the moment,"" Walter said. ""These suburban voters who in years past would split their votes more evenly between Democrats and Republicans are now coming out overwhelmingly against Trump.""
Virginia, where voters showed up in record numbers for Tuesday's primary, is a case in point.

Roughly 1.3 million Virginia voters cast ballots, about 21 percent of the electorate, according to unofficial results. That's up from the previous record of about 986,000 votes and 18 percent of the electorate in 2008, when Obama was challenging Hillary Clinton for the party's nomination.
""The interest . . . in defeating Donald Trump is so intense that it's almost unprecedented,"" Richmond political scientist Bob Holsworth said.
Biden was the beneficiary of the Virginia groundswell, easily beating Sanders and three other candidates.
""It's just extraordinary. In the commonwealth of Virginia, folks are fired up. They want to beat Trump,"" former governor Terry McAuliffe (D) said in an interview. He pointed to massive jumps in turnout in the once-purple D.C. suburbs, which he said reflected ""the intensity of the anti-Trump feeling in Northern Virginia.""
Cities with large African American populations also registered strong gains, with black voters accounting for a quarter of all ballots cast.
Biden also prevailed in Minnesota, Massachusetts and across the South, building on a swift-moving series of events in which two of his main moderate challengers dropped out of the race and endorsed him before Tuesday.
The endorsements by former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, combined with Biden's resounding win Saturday in South Carolina, had an impact. Voters who decided late heavily backed Biden, according to exit poll results.
While Biden came away from Tuesday's primaries with the most delegates, the contests revealed some of the challenges he faces as he tries to secure the nomination and pull together a fractured party.
He was trailing Sanders in the country's most populous state, California, as votes were still being counted, and he continues to lag with Hispanics and younger voters. It's also not clear how Biden would win over the liberal wing of the party, which has supported Sanders's agenda advocating more sweeping changes.
But Biden's victories also brought into sharper relief Sanders's failure to deliver on his pledge to drive a surge in turnout among young people and disaffected voters he contended would power his campaign to a revolution-style victory.
Sanders on Tuesday acknowledged he was disappointed in the turnout figures.
""I will be honest with you, we have not done as well in bringing young people into the political process,"" he told reporters in Burlington, Vt. ""It is not easy.""

According to exit polls, about 13 percent of voters in Super Tuesday states were 18-to-29-year-olds, compared with 3 in 10 who were 65 or older.
Republicans were quick to point out that Biden entered the race last year as a presumed leader, only to falter because of uneven performances on the campaign trail and lackluster fundraising.
""Just a few days ago, Democrats had left Joe Biden for dead because they realized he was a terrible candidate. Nothing has changed,"" said Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh. ""He's still a terrible candidate, and we still don't know if he'll be President Trump's opponent.""
Trump and his campaign have sought to interfere with the Democrats' primaries, openly pushing for a protracted fight between the party's liberal and moderate wings that could last through the nominating convention in July.
Sanders said Tuesday that he planned to move forward with his campaign and attacked Biden as a member of the ""establishment"" who has voted for bad trade deals.
A drawn-out Democratic battle over delegates and party rules would allow Trump to continue his attempts to build his coalition ahead of the general election. Trump, who spoke to the Latino Coalition Legislative Summit on Wednesday, has been making a public appeal to minority voters to back his campaign.
Some younger Latino voters, who have backed Sanders overwhelmingly, distrust Biden because of the high number of deportations that took place during the Obama administration, said Stephen Nuño-Perez of Latino Decisions, a nonpartisan polling firm that focuses on Latino political and social attitudes and that has done work for Democratic organizations.
Exit polling suggested that Biden won the votes of roughly 70 percent of black voters in Virginia and Alabama and did nearly as well in North Carolina and Texas, getting roughly 60 percent of the vote. Biden also won in Tennessee, Oklahoma and Arkansas.
Darren Peters, who worked on the presidential campaigns of Bill and Hillary Clinton, said Biden's strong showing with black voters in Southern states could help him if he becomes the party's nominee.
""It shows an ability to galvanize the kinds of constituencies that are going to be needed to win in a general election,"" Peters said, highlighting the importance of the black vote in key swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan.
While some Democrats have wondered if Biden, a familiar face with a long track record, would lose in the same way as Hillary Clinton, Biden drew broader support in North Carolina and Virginia than Clinton did in 2016. Clinton won 86 percent of Virginia precincts and 65 percent of North Carolina precincts in 2016. Biden won 93 percent of precincts in both states.
Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who ended his presidential bid last year, said Trump should be nervous about Biden's ability to ""connect with the Whole Foods moms and the suburban women"" who may have voted Republican in the past but have been turned off by the president's divisiveness.
""I think there's a silent majority of people who want Donald Trump out of office,"" Ryan said. ""They don't want to have heated discussions with people about it. They don't want to get in fights with people about it. They don't want to be on social media about it, but they're appalled at his behavior.""

DES MOINES "" Conflict between Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is a story that has been waiting to happen. What no one expected is that their first clash of the 2020 Democratic president race would come over issues of gender, class and electability.
Everything you need to know about the debate: winners and losers and the Fact Checker's rundown. Sign up for the Trailer for campaign news and insight.
Contradictory versions of what happened during a private dinner more than a year ago as both were preparing to enter the race "" Warren says Sanders told her a woman could not win the White House; Sanders says he said no such thing "" brought them to the brink of open conflict. Significantly, the flash point underscored the broader reality that success for one could mean the undoing of the other.
When the two met on the debate stage Tuesday night, neither appeared eager to air the details of what happened at their dinner in December 2018. Sanders stoutly denied again that he said or believes that a woman can't win the presidency. Warren stood by her version of events and used the moment to state forcefully why she is confident a woman can win and might do better than a man against President Trump.

But even if the two appeared ready to declare a truce about their dinner onstage, there is little doubt that they remain on a collision course as voters begin to cast their first votes of the campaign, with the Feb.-3 Iowa caucuses and the Feb.-11 New Hampshire primary the testing grounds that will shape the futures of both.
After the debate wrapped up, Warren appeared to avoid shaking hands with Sanders, and the two appeared to have a testy exchange.
Tuesday's debate at Drake University was the last such event ahead of the caucuses, and it came days before the Senate begins the impeachment trial of the president. The debate highlighted that at a time when any of four candidates appear to have a chance of winning the caucuses, there are two pairings in competition with one another.
Former vice president Joe Biden and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg are appealing to those looking for more modest policy initiatives and calls for unity, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) trying to break into that competition. Meanwhile, Sanders and Warren are appealing to voters looking for big policy changes and a candidate with a fighting posture. 
Neither Sanders nor Warren is thinking or talking about small-bore politics. Sanders wants a grass-roots revolution to overturn the current power structure. Warren has said, 'We have a better chance of winning a big fight than we do a small fight.' 
For the past year, the two have avoided taking on each other, preferring to focus on those larger visions. In part, that's because they are longtime friends, having met years before Warren moved from academia to politics. They found common cause over the concerns about the hollowing out of the middle class and a shared belief that the economic and political systems are rigged against ordinary Americans.
They still share those assessments of the economy and of the political system. Sanders attacks the billionaire class at every turn. Warren describes the system as one that has been corrupted by money and power. Each has made that message the foundation of their presidential campaigns. And each is wary of alienating voters that are loyal to the other but at some point may be up for grabs.
For the past few months, Warren found herself looking at Buttigieg as a more immediate threat in Iowa. She took a lead in a September Iowa poll by the Des Moines Register and CNN, only to see Buttigieg overtake her in the November poll. 
She and the mayor seemed to be competing in Iowa for the support of more-affluent voters with college degrees. Sanders's campaign saw that as an opening and seized it. Over the weekend, Politico reported that volunteers in the Sanders campaign were being urged to tell voters that Warren was a candidate of the elite "" of the rich and well educated. 
Warren expressed disappointment, and Sanders noted that he had not personally approved the script used by the volunteers, emphasizing that he had not directly attacked Warren at any point since the campaign started. But that hardly resolved the matter. The Sanders campaign criticism appeared designed to cast Warren as a candidate with a narrower appeal.
Then came the story, first reported by CNN, about Sanders's ostensible comments during the dinner conversation in December 2018. Whatever competition exists between Warren and Buttigieg "" and there is some "" the new story was a reminder of the inevitability of the competition between Sanders and Warren.
The biggest issue that has shadowed the candidacies of both Sanders and Warren is whether any nominee who is as liberal as they are, whose agendas would enlarge the role of government as much as each has proposed, can win a general election against Trump. 
But the other question, heard from voters along the campaign trail, is whether any female candidate can capture the White House. It is a question understandably resented by female candidates, but one they nonetheless must confront. Warren did so cogently when the question arose in the debate.
'This question about whether or not a woman can be president has been raised, and it's time for us to attack it head-on,' she said. 'And I think the best way to talk about who can win is by looking at people's winning record . . . Look at the men on this stage. Collectively, they have lost 10 elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they've been in are the women, Amy and me.'
Warren also sought to harness her candidacy to earlier Democratic pathbreakers, noting that in 1962 some questioned if a Catholic could win the presidency and that in 2008 they asked the same about an African American "" but that John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama proved them wrong. 
Sanders said that 'of course' a woman can win the presidency, but added that the central question for Democrats is who is best equipped to defeat Trump, and argued that the energy surrounding his candidacy gives him the strongest chance.
A major factor contributing to the inevitability of a Sanders-Warren clash is the political calendar, with the first two states "" Iowa and New Hampshire "" potentially decisive in determining which one has the support to move to the later contests with momentum.
Iowa has turned into a free-for-all. Sanders was leading in the latest Iowa poll, considered the most reliable indicator of voter attitudes here. Biden is leading in a Monmouth University poll released this week; Warren and Buttigieg both have led in earlier surveys. The order of finish in Iowa now becomes extremely important for all four candidates. 
New Hampshire could be even more consequential, especially for Warren and Sanders, given political history. Both come from states adjacent to New Hampshire, which historically has proven an advantage. 
That gives both of them a potential edge, and whoever finishes behind the other will have suffered a significant setback.
For the next three weeks, the fluidity of the competition in Iowa will consume all the campaigns. The major candidates will be looking at one another, aware that the order of finish, however close, will shape perceptions in ways that all the polls and commentary cannot do.
Sanders sees an opportunity to seize an advantage with a victory here and then in New Hampshire. Biden knows that a victory in Iowa could set him on a course to the nomination. Buttigieg knows that a strong finish here, especially one that puts him ahead of Biden, could be the springboard for his hopes. And Warren counts on her deep organization to surprise those who believe she has fallen back.
There have been surprises over the past year with the ebbs and flows of the polls and candidate performances. But there are some things about the Democratic race that have been clear from the start. One of those is the Warren-Sanders dynamic, and as the days before Iowa continue to dwindle, that has come into clearer focus.

'It feels a little bit like, I don't know, being in a movie. It's very surreal,' says Evelyn Yang. 
She's one of the few, the proud, the exhausted: the spouses and partners of the 2020 campaign. 
It all began for her at the dinner table some 16 months ago, when her husband, Andrew Yang, then CEO of the nonprofit he'd started, told her he was thinking about running for president of the United States. 
'Andrew says that the first time he told me, I said something like, 'Please pass the salt,' ' she says. 'I just thought it was probably a phase.'
Flash-forward to December, when he was the only candidate of color left on the Democratic debate stage, and Evelyn was 'sitting way up high in the bleachers with Teri Hatcher,' the actress from 'Desperate Housewives,' who is a member of the Yang Gang, as his most fervent supporters call themselves. A day earlier, musician, actor, producer and director Donald Glover announced he was joining the campaign as an official 'creative consultant.' 
Evelyn is a homemaker raising the couple's two young boys, 7 and 4, the elder of whom is on the autism spectrum. Recently, she's started joining her husband on the campaign trail, and now she's facing cameras everywhere. Right after the debate she did her first solo fundraiser in Los Angeles, 'and it was weird, because most of the staff left with Andrew,' she says, laughing. 'It's like being left alone on a movie set' after the crew has gone.
Behind each of the two dozen announcements from Democratic presidential hopefuls has been a significant other who's had to jump onto the roller coaster, all smiles, too. Some, such as Jill Biden and Jane Sanders, have done this before, but no one could have prepared for this historically large and diverse field, with so many potential first gentlemen campaigning, or a primary season that's coinciding with the third presidential impeachment in the nation's history. Or a sitting president who sends more than 100 tweets in a 24-hour period and then takes the country to the brink of war with Iran just as the race heats up.
If you're a modern presidential candidate's significant other, you've got the dual jobs of being an uncomplaining source of support for your partner, making sure he or she is getting fed and sleeping and has someone to vent to, plus often being the mouthpiece for your partner and attending events he or she can't get to. Not to mention doing your actual job, which could be being a teacher or a professor (Joe Biden's wife, Jill Biden; Elizabeth Warren's husband, Bruce Mann; Amy Klobuchar's husband, John Bessler) or raising small kids (Yang), or doing both (Erica Castro, whose husband, Julián Castro, recently dropped out of the race) "" while trying not to say anything that will derail your candidate's hopes and dreams.
'I liken it to being shot out of a cannon, even for someone like myself who's been through several elections,' says Doug Emhoff, husband to Sen. Kamala D. Harris, who kept up his entertainment law practice during Harris's run, which ended on Dec. 3. 
Chasten Buttigieg, the husband of presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, says nothing could prepare him for the highs and the lows: 'Obviously, life changes when you get, like, nasty letters to your house telling you you'd be better off dead.' (They've instituted a policy of forwarding their mail to the campaign for filtering first.) But then a lot of other days, he's hearing from LGBTQ kids who are telling him they were able to come out to their families because of Buttigieg's run. 
Big hugs
While the candidates are competitors, the spouses are often spending long hours waiting in the wings together. Emhoff calls it 'the surrogate circuit.' It's a little like the long Oscars season, or maybe even high school, in that unlikely friendships form from frequency of exposure and the shared experience of being a plus one "" although the trappings are usually community centers in Iowa, and it's the leadership of the free world, rather than a golden statue, that's at stake. 
'I was wondering how much of this would be about people walking around, acting like they were auditioning for the role of being the first whatever, man, woman,' says Rosario Dawson, partner to Sen. Cory Booker, and an actress who knows her way around awards functions. 'But it actually feels much more natural and off the cuff and more sincere and regular.' 
According to Bernie Sanders's wife Jane, the vibe is far more collegial than in 2016. But, calling other spouses 'friends' is a bit of a stretch, she says. 'It's more of good acquaintances,' and there's 'often a big hug,' she says.
What they all have in common is being a partner to someone who believes he or she has a duty to defeat President Trump. 'I think we would be united in saying that we all see the weight of what's happening in this country, and it's on the shoulders of each of the candidates,' Jane Sanders says. The couples have the same goal: 'I don't think for any of them that it's about personal power. I think it's personal responsibility.'
Chasten Buttigieg, who's taken a leave of absence from being a middle school teacher, and Emhoff became friendly early on. 'It's interesting to find yourselves in a very, very small cohort of people who are supporting their spouses as they run for president of the United States,' Buttigieg says. 'We connect on a few different levels that even your best friends can't quite understand.' Almost immediately, he says, he gave Emhoff his cellphone number and said he was free to chat whenever, 'you know, just as a fellow human experiencing this.' 
When Harris was still in the race, Emhoff says, he, Buttigieg, and other spouses might check in to see who was going to a particular event so they could hang out together in the holding room, or text each other during debates.
As a newbie, Evelyn Yang says, she has leaned on Tom Steyer's wife, Mary. Their husbands are the two non-politicians left in the race, but Mary knows the ropes better and stepped in when Evelyn seemed a little baffled by the spin room after the Atlanta debate. 'You've got somebody holding a sign with your name on it and you have to follow the sign, like follow the red balloon,' says Yang. 'Or else if you get separated from the group you might never be seen again.'
Jane Sanders and Jill Biden have known each other for years, and have had lunch when doing events for military families, and Dawson has spent time with the Sanders family since she was a Bernie surrogate in 2016.
The Sanderses and Warren and Mann have whiled away time together while stuck in airports. 'We talked and talked and talked policy,' Jane says. 'We're all policy wonks.' Bessler says he and Mann geek out about their shared love of legal history whenever they run into each other. 
Mainly within the surrogate circuit, says Dawson, 'It's a lot of going, 'Is he eating? Is he sleeping?' There's a lot or respect and care that people have for each other. The last election was very, very contentious, and I think the entire country just wants to be in a different energy.'
'Sweetheart status'
Each significant other has to figure out what his or her role will be in the campaign. Melania Trump, for instance, was relatively silent and traveled very little for her husband's 2016 campaign. As first lady, she's increasingly visible, and at the Florida rally where Trump kicked off his reelection campaign, she introduced him. 
Erica Castro and Evelyn Yang mostly stayed out of the public eye while raising their young children. But Yang has begun to take on the role of speaking to women and explaining how Andrew's universal basic income proposal will acknowledge unpaid caregivers. Tulsi Gabbard's husband, Abraham Williams, a cinematographer, seems to feel most comfortable by her side making her campaign videos. Warren's husband, Mann, a Harvard law professor whom a fellow Senate spouse described as 'shy,' has mostly been seen standing nearby at his wife's massive selfie lines, and bringing their golden retriever, Bailey, to events. Bailey unequivocally has a bigger social media presence than Mann. 

Jill Biden, who teaches English at a community college, keeps a travel schedule that is almost as extensive as her husband's, has her own chief of staff and press secretary, and has a platform supporting military families and promoting education.
Bessler, who teaches law at the University of Baltimore and Georgetown University Law Center, gives speeches when Klobuchar can't, and meets with local leaders to secure their endorsements. That laugh line she uses about how she's the candidate who's raised $17,000 from ex-boyfriends? 'I came up with the coda,' says Bessler, 'that it's not an expanding base.'
Jane Sanders started off in 2016, 'just greeting the crowd with Bernie, waving, smiling, letting them know that he has a family.' Now the former president of Burlington College in Vermont "" who was dismissed amid a fundraising scandal
 "" is a senior adviser to the campaign. She has her own team and doesn't go to fundraisers, but she likes to go into communities to talk to artists, educators and Native American leaders, and then bring back ideas to shape Bernie's policies. 
'I hear from the other spouses often, 'The campaign is sending me here. The campaign is sending me there,'' she says. 'And I decide where I'm going.'
 All of the potential first gentlemen in the race, except for Chasten, have kept their day jobs, a rarity among political spouses, mainly because political spouses are traditionally expected to be 'the good wife.' Connie Schultz, who wrote the book '. . . And His Lovely Wife,' based on her campaign experiences with her husband, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), says it's been frustrating to see all the positive attention the male spouses of 2020 have been getting from the media. 'Is the expectation going to be different because men have careers "" and my teeth are grinding as I say that "" because many of the women have careers as well. And the expectation always is that we'll drop everything for our husbands,' she says. 'I don't hear that being the mantra for the men.'
Being a presidential candidate's spouse also means holidays and birthdays and anniversaries spent on the road. And it's up to the candidates, too, to try to maintain a connection. Chasten says Pete 'is good about maintaining his sweetheart status' by leaving little gifts on Chasten's pillow for him to find when he's back in South Bend. 
 Erica Castro says that Julián, who dropped out Jan. 2, never failed to come back home to San Antonio for major events in their young kids' lives, particularly when their 10-year-old daughter, Carina, got the part of Anna in her school's 'Frozen' musical.
Dawson is juggling work and her father's cancer treatments. She went straight from her father's surgery to the Atlanta debate and back to the hospital.
The Sanderses make a point of spending every night together (that they can) if they're in the same state. After his heart attack in October, she dropped her schedule and he didn't go anywhere without her for about two months. They celebrate holidays when they can fit them in: They had a small Thanksgiving dinner "" 'just the two of us, romantic, candlelight' "" and then a feast on Dec. 4 because that's when all the kids were around.
Bessler and Klobuchar, on the other hand, spent their last anniversary apart. 'I think I got a tweet for our anniversary,' he says, laughing. But not just any tweet, 'her 10,000th tweet, so that's very exciting. She probably had to slow down the tweeting a little bit to make that happen.' 

And as the world slows down, so, too, do the rhythms of campaigns. The night before Thanksgiving, Klobuchar and Bessler (and their daughter, Abigail, who is 24 and lives in Brooklyn) and Harris and Emhoff happened to be staying in the same hotel in Des Moines, and met up at the hotel bar for pizza and drinks. 'I just remember a lot of laughs and a lot of fun stories about being on the trail,' Emhoff says. 'Amy is pretty funny and she was cracking us up.' 

A week later, Harris announced she was suspending her campaign. Emhoff says they both got supportive notes from many of the candidates and spouses.
Coming off the trail is a hard blow, recalls Chirlane McCray, wife of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio "" who dropped out in September. She'd traveled the country talking about mental health care and made solo visits to black churches in South Carolina. McCray, who is black, said she was 'especially comfortable' doing that outreach, and it felt 'bittersweet' when it was over.
'It takes a lot out of you, physically, to campaign, so it was nice that we got to sleep in our own bed and didn't have to wake up thinking, 'Where am I? Who am I talking to today?' ' But it had also been thrilling meet voters and that was hard to give up, too.
Emhoff says he and Harris spent weeks after her withdrawal visiting staff and saying, 'Oh, this sucks.' But recently, things have normalized as much as possible. She's got the president's impeachment trial coming up in the Senate; he's focusing on his law practice. 

He has enough distance that he can appreciate the 'great memories' he's come away with and so many relationships that feel 'real and solid and hopefully will go forward.'
He got a round of texts from his old surrogate circuit a few weeks ago when Maya Rudolph impersonated Harris crashing the Los Angeles debate, drinking a cosmopolitan, a wind machine whipping her hair around, and telling America, 'You coulda had a bad b----!' on Saturday Night Live. 
'That was actually great, because it had been a few weeks after we got out and just seeing that made us both smile,' says Emhoff. 'It was so funny and a total surprise, and it just showed that at the lowest moment we found that people are still engaged with her, and the campaign really mattered.'

DES MOINES "" Three years after Donald Trump dashed Democratic hopes of electing the country's first female president, a fierce debate has erupted in the party's presidential race about whether a woman can defeat him in November.
As a result, long-simmering questions about gender and sexism have been thrust to the forefront of the primary race just weeks before the first nominating contest on Feb. 3.
Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) acknowledged for the first time this week that they discussed the fraught topic privately more than a year ago. They presented conflicting accounts of their conversation at a debate Tuesday night, with Warren saying Sanders disagreed with her view that a woman could win. Sanders contends that he merely outlined what he said would be Trump's efforts to defeat another female candidate, and in the debate, he said, 'Of course a woman can win.'
Warren took a different approach. Making her most direct appeal yet on the basis of gender, she urged voters not to overlook the added hurdle that female candidates face. But it's one she can clear and make history, she argued, drawing parallels to barriers that Presidents John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama broke.


'Look, don't deny that the question is there,' Warren said. 'Back in the 1960s, people asked, 'Could a Catholic win?' Back in 2008, people asked if an African American could win. In both times, the Democratic Party stepped up and said yes.'


The clash between Sanders and Warren, both personal and public, has abruptly amplified a difficult conversation that has been underway at Democratic gatherings across the country ever since Trump's election. And it cast a spotlight on shifting attitudes in the party toward women running for office in the Trump era.
Hillary Clinton's 2016 loss shocked Democrats and prompted many to wonder whether the country was ready for a female president. But it also pushed women to become more politically involved, leading to a record number of Democratic women in Congress; the return of the first female House speaker, Nancy Pelosi; and a new generation of women joining the presidential contest.
But now, less than three weeks before the Iowa caucuses, two men "" Sanders and former vice president Joe Biden "" have ascended to the top of the polls, joined in some of them by former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Butti gieg. Warren has faded since the fall. And once-promising campaigns by women such as Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) have ended.
'We keep getting stuck in the 'Yeah, but, can a woman beat Trump?' ' said Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily's List, a group focused on electing Democratic women who support abortion rights. 'We've been, for 12 months, looking at electability in a really narrow way, and it's caused a huge amount of problems in this primary.'
But for many voters, supporting a woman for president is not an easy decision. With Democrats so eager to defeat a president they see as a racist, sexist bully, many say they wonder whether the safest bet to defeat him is a man.
'Because I'm a woman, I suppose I should be wanting [Warren], but I'm not voting for her because she's a woman,' said Marilyn Kean, 78, a Sanders supporter from Wilton, Iowa. 'Too many men that don't want women in there.'
Biden elliptically referred to that calculation earlier this month, when he noted that Clinton faced 'unfair' sexism during her campaign.
'That's not going to happen with me,' Biden said.
Reports about the conversation between Sanders and Warren caught Trump's attention. 'I don't believe that Bernie said that,' the president said Tuesday night at a rally in Milwaukee.
The row between Sanders and Warren brought the debate over gender rushing to the surface in a race that, until recently, had been more cordial than many past campaigns.





It started Monday when CNN first reported on the 2018 one-on-one meeting, in which Sanders allegedly told Warren that a woman couldn't beat Trump. The Sanders campaign vehemently denied the report, with a top aide calling it a 'lie' "" but, in a sign that the issue was not likely to subside, Warren then confirmed it.
The dispute continued at Tuesday night's debate, hosted by CNN and the Des Moines Register, where Warren and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) joined four men on the stage.


'Well, as a matter of fact, I didn't say it,' Sanders said. He said he didn't want to spend much time on the topic, arguing that it would play into Trump's hands, but he added that anyone who knows him would agree that it is 'incomprehensible that I would think a woman cannot be president.'
Sanders said Clinton besting Trump in the popular vote in 2016 was clear evidence that a woman can win. He also said he held back in deciding to run that year before Warren made up her mind about the race.
Warren did not back down from her claim that Sanders told her a woman couldn't defeat Trump. Asked what she thought of his comment, she replied, 'I disagreed.' And she said it was time to attack the subject 'head on.'
'Can a woman beat Donald Trump? Look at the men on this stage "" collectively they have lost 10 elections,' she said, prompting gasps and cheers from the crowd. 'The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they've been in are the women.' She said she was the only one who had defeated an incumbent Republican in the past 30 years.
Sanders took issue with her comment, saying he defeated a Republican incumbent running for Congress in 1990. Warren responded by pausing to make an exaggerated show of doing the math in her head, before shooting back, 'Wasn't that 30 years ago?' Sanders eventually backed down, saying it was not the major issue of the day.


Klobuchar joined the fray, saying the power of female candidates was evident in recent wins by women in gubernatorial races in Michigan and Kansas. 'You have to be competent to win, and you have to know what you're doing,' she said.
Tensions appeared to remain high immediately after the conclusion of the debate, when Warren and Sanders were caught on video holding a brief yet animated discussion after Warren declined to shake Sanders's hand.




The clash played on the still-raw wounds of the 2016 campaign and continued consternation by some sympathetic to Clinton who saw Sanders and his backers as insufficiently supportive of her in that contest.
The revelations could draw new scrutiny to Sanders, who faced criticism in 2016 for a campaign that many saw as too white and too male. He has taken steps to address that perception, hiring a more diverse staff and securing the support of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and other women of color.
The sharp break in recollections by Sanders and Warren was particularly unnerving for the liberal wing of the party, fearful that divisions between the two most leftward candidates would usher in a moderate nominee.
'Too much is at stake right now for mutual destruction,' said Rebecca Katz, a liberal strategist who plans to vote for Warren but also likes Sanders. 'Our eyes need to be on the prize.'

A statement from an influential union said as much.
'We can't afford distractions. The only way any candidate can beat either Sanders or Warren is by dividing them. This looks like a desperate attempt to fracture a coalition of the candidates that represent the most popular ideas among working people,' said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants.
The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which backs Warren, said in its own statement that 'a back-and-forth about this private meeting is counter-productive for progressives. In this pivotal moment of the campaign, progressives must work together to defeat Donald Trump and prevent a less-electable establishment candidate like Joe Biden from getting the nomination.'
Others underscored the personal impact of the disputed words.
'Yes, many people have told me a woman can't win in 2020,' tweeted author and columnist Connie Schultz, who is married to Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who considered a presidential run. 'This is fear speaking, - it has sparked meaningful conversations. But a woman hears this differently when she is the one who is running. It feels personal because it is. Can we please not lose sight of this difference?'
The Gillibrand campaign, which ran on gender issues and gained little traction, conducted research on sexism she faced and found that voters frequently would say that gender didn't matter. But there was a hitch, according to a person familiar with the campaign.
'Voters said they would have no issues with a woman, but they worried that other people might have issues,' said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive campaign material. 'That's classic research which shows deflection and actually is more of what that individual thinks.'
In September, a Washington Post-ABC News poll found that 23-percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said a man would be more likely to defeat Trump than a woman; 7 percent said a woman would be more likely to win, while a 69 percent majority said the gender of a candidate didn't matter.
Warren has been putting more emphasis on her gender, seeking to re-energize the anti-Trump passion that gave rise to women's marches and a high turnout of female voters in 2018.
Dan Pfeiffer, a former aide to Obama, compared the current situation with what Obama faced as a black candidate in 2008.
'I would say the challenge now is even more difficult,' he said, adding that in the 2008 campaign, Democrats widely believed that they would defeat the Republican nominee after eight years of George W. Bush. 'The questions of electability were more in the background than they are today.'
He added, 'All of the what I believe to be incorrect racial and gender stereotypes around electability are so much more damaging now.'

CONCORD, N.H. "" In early December, about 100 activists aligned with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) gathered in South Bend, Ind., the home turf of rival candidate Pete Buttigieg. They held up signs touting Medicare-for-all and other signature Sanders proposals. One accused Buttigieg of neglecting African Americans. Another said it was crucial for Sanders to win the election.
This was not a Sanders campaign event. It was a rally staged by Our Revolution, a nonprofit founded by the senator that has caused some awkwardness for him in his second run for president. While the group is supporting his candidacy, it accepts large donations without fully disclosing who made them, a practice at odds with his calls for greater transparency and stated desire to curtail the power of the wealthy in elections.

 Sanders was questioned about the group's practices here Sunday, when he said in a radio interview he would 'have no problem' with the group opting to provide more information about its donors. But he suggested he would not call on its leaders to do so while his opponents continue to rely on similar organizations.
'You've got groups all over the country that legally can do what they want. And I would be very happy to say and to urge an end to all that if other candidates do the same. So I am not in favor of these things,' Sanders said in an hour-long interview on New Hampshire Public Radio. 'That is the way it is.'
These were his most detailed comments of the race on Our Revolution, an organization Sanders launched in 2016 before separating from the group. Though barred by federal laws from coordinating with his campaign, the group has emerged as a potent part of Sanders's grass-roots army, with hundreds of thousands of members and activists working across the country to promote his presidential bid.
Tax filings show Our Revolution raised nearly $2.7 million in 2018, the most recent year for which records are available. That total includes more than $500,000 from 15 donors whose identities have been shielded. Two of those donors made six-figure contributions.

The scale of the group's activities is small compared to other politically active nonprofits that have spent tens of millions of dollars trying to influence the election. And the money it collected in 2018 is dwarfed by the tens of millions Sanders and his rivals have hauled into their official campaign accounts.
Still, the group's work shows how Sanders is benefiting from some of the types of donors he criticizes, as well as the kind of shadowy group he has decried.
Paco Fabian, a spokesman for Our Revolution, said the group follows all campaign finance rules and in some cases exceeds federal transparency requirements. But the group declined to identify its largest donors, saying it is respecting their wishes to remain private. 
Sanders supports legislation that would end political spending by politically active nonprofits 'and other organizations who accept unlimited contributions or do not disclose donors,' according to his 2020 campaign platform. And he has frequently denigrated his opponents' fundraising practices, lambasting those who have courted wealthy donors. 

'I think we should end super PACs right now. So I would tell my opponents who have a super PAC, 'Why don't you end it?' And certainly that's applicable to the groups that are supporting me,' Sanders said in the Sunday interview.
Over the past year, Our Revolution has hosted Iowa town halls, organized postcard writing in early states in support of Sanders's candidacy and gone knocking on doors. The South Bend rally was one of its highest-profile events.
Federal law requires nonprofits to disclose large donations "" though not donor names "" in tax filings, which Our Revolution does. The group also lists on its website the names of donors who gave more than $250. But it does not provide specific amounts the donors gave, and contributors who wish to remain anonymous are obscured "" for example, a donor whose name is listed as 'Anonymous Anonymous.'
Sometimes, the line between Our Revolution and Sanders has blurred, such as when Sanders participated in a conference call with the group's members.
And some of Sanders's allies have shown up on the campaign's rolls as well as the group's leadership. Among them is Nina Turner, a national co-chair of the Sanders campaign who was paid nearly $200,000 by Our Revolution and served as president before stepping down to join the campaign.

Political consultant
on running for president during an era of social distancing
As the coronavirus spread to over 40 states, and as the number of Americans infected increased, two campaigns for the Democratic presidential nomination were hopscotching across the country on airplanes carrying hundreds of people: the candidates, exhausted staffers and journalists covering the politicians' every move. These ensembles often traveled to multiple states on a single day, from one crowded event to another, in an effort to win delegates, who will then gather at a national convention in just a few months. 
What could possibly go wrong?
It's hard to imagine a worse activity to undertake during a pandemic than a presidential campaign. Combating the virus demands social distancing, but a campaign demands social contact - constantly. The more of it, the better. That ethos is changing fast, however: On Tuesday night, both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders called off primary-night campaign rallies ""out of concern for public health and safety,"" as the Sanders camp put it. The Democratic Party has moved its Sunday debate from Phoenix to Washington and will hold it without an audience, and both the Biden and Sanders camps have told staffers to work from home and ended door-to-door canvassing. After defiantly announcing a ""Catholics for Trump"" rally in Milwaukee this coming week, President Trump's campaign pulled the plug on it - and the president also canceled a trip to Nevada and Colorado. 
If the virus continues its current trajectory, the candidates may find themselves conducting the first ""no touch"" campaign in American history - one in which baby-kissing is unthinkable, ""virtual"" rallies replace raucous crowds and the conventions become only-for-TV events. Trump seems more likely to resist this path, out of either stubbornness or ignorance, but even if just the Democrats modify their behavior, it would be a remarkable spectacle that could even affect which candidate wins in November. 
Sen. Sanders (I-Vt.), former vice president Biden and Trump are all in their 70s, so people rightly wondered whether they were at risk of catching the virus on the campaign trail. On CNN's ""State of the Union"" last weekend, Sanders - who, despite getting 
trounced in Tuesday's primaries, says he will continue his campaign
- suggested that he might have avoided crowds ""in the best of all possible worlds, maybe."" But at that point, he said he'd be running ""as hard as we can.""
In fact, protecting the candidates is the relatively easy part. Presidential campaign staffs are quite adept at social distancing; they do it all the time when they want to keep their candidate from the press, for example. They can use similar methods at public events: Have their candidate enter through a side door, approach a podium from behind the stage, speak to a room full of 1,000 people (or an arena of 15,000), from a safe distance, and then leave to thundering applause without ever coming within a few feet of anyone. 
It's the crowds that are most at risk in this scenario, and not just from other audience members. Few understand the enormous number of people that a presidential campaign - whether during a primary race or a general election - puts in motion every time the candidate travels.
First there are the advance teams. Those crowds aren't spontaneous, after all. An advance team that assembled a crowd and managed an event for a candidate in Seattle last week may be in Miami building the next crowd this week. Unlike the candidates, advance teams don't have the option of not interacting with people. From scouting locations, working with local law enforcement to organizing volunteers working the event, it's just not possible to build a crowd without interacting with a lot of people. 
Then there are the journalists who wander into the audience and ask all those questions (""Why are you for Bernie?"" ""Why Trump?""), then get back on the campaign plane to ask similar questions, in a new crowd, in a new city.
In retrospect, it seems almost insane: Before Tuesday's primaries, the Democratic campaigns and the press were shuttling among Missouri, Michigan and the state of Washington, which has seen the largest number of people testing positive for the coronavirus and the largest number of deaths in the United States. Then they were off to Arizona, Florida, Ohio and Illinois. It's not just the travel itself: It's the pace of it, the range, the close quarters on planes and in those rooms and arenas.
The recent cancellations are reassuring, and they suggest we're about to enter a new world of campaigning. In the past few election cycles, campaigns have made use of ""tele-town halls,"" in which thousands of supporters can call in to a conference number and hear the candidate speak live to them. Such virtual town halls could replace rallies; Biden has announced that his funding raising events will be virtual, too, for now.
The loss of door-to-door campaigning could be one of the bigger setbacks that the virus deals to the campaigns. Over the past decade, campaigns have seen a resurgence in engaged supporters volunteering to knock on doors - and voters seem more receptive to appeals from neighbors and fellow citizens than they do to TV ads, which are increasingly viewed as propaganda. What's more, getting out the vote is the mainstay of every campaign's field organization: Volunteers go to polling places, check off the names of those who have voted and then drive to the houses of those who haven't - even offering a ride to the polls. Volunteers can still call voters, from their own homes, but they won't be offering anyone a ride. (And the system breaks down if volunteers can't check those lists at polling sites.) If the crisis continues, the campaigns will have to reinvent field organizing and get-out-the-vote operations, though it's hard to envision how.

A ""no-touch"" campaign would inevitably be one that's more driven by expensive advertising. And satellite interviews with local TV news programs, already a staple of campaigns, will become even more important, possibly shifting the balance of power somewhat from cable news to local stations in key states.
Such a campaign will hurt some candidates more than others. Sanders's days as a candidate are probably numbered, but he has relied on crowd events to demonstrate the energy and passion his message generates; it's hard to imagine a substitute in a world where large assemblies are taboo. Which also raises the question of how Trump's campaign will respond, given that its signature has been large rallies. Can this man possibly conduct a reelection campaign sans adoring crowds wearing MAGA hats? He is likely to view the long-term abandonment of these events as an implicit admission that his handling of the crisis is not, as he likes to say, ""perfect."" So might he - despite this week's display of caution - conclude he'd prefer to resume the kind of campaigning he enjoys so much? 
He can try. But if the coronavirus continues to spread, and if public health officials urge Americans to avoid crowds, even White House propaganda may not be enough to prevent Republicans from grasping reality. Trump may face the prospect of his supporters staying home and watching on TV as he speaks to smaller and smaller crowds - a potentially humiliating spectacle.
Democrats and Republicans might also have to scrap their national conventions as we know them. We've already seen several Republican elected officials who attended the Conservative Political Action Conference in late February choose to self-quarantine because of contact with an attendee who tested positive for the coronavirus. Some of those same officials also had contact with Trump before they isolated themselves. This worry and confusion arose from an event that's tiny relative to a party convention. 
For years, both party conventions have been little more than partisan TV shows; the coronavirus could offer an opportunity finally to admit this fact. There is no reason to have delegates travel during a health crisis to be props in a party telethon. The parties can produce one night of live speeches and videos, and the next night air the nominee's acceptance speech and the unveiling (or, in the Republicans' case, the re-unveiling) of the vice-presidential nominee. For a while, it looked as if a brokered Democratic convention might be a possibility. That's not going to happen, so there's no need to plan secure ways for state delegations to caucus and vote on multiple ballots without being in the same large room.
With luck, the coronavirus will abate by Election Day in November. If not, there will be no easy way to handle the possibly hundreds of thousands of voters who could be ill or quarantined. As a contingency, state legislatures should change laws for absentee ballots, making them far easier to cast. The virus doesn't know red from blue, so this should be a bipartisan issue. 
No one wants to see any of this occur. But the coronavirus is disrupting global supply chains, upending stock markets and spurring nations to effectively lock down their populations. It would be sheer hubris to think that, amid such chaos, the American presidential campaign is somehow immune.

Super Tuesday is the day when the most states hold contests to pick a presidential nominee, the most voters have a chance to go to the polls, and the most delegates will be allotted. More than a third of all delegates for the Democratic National Convention are up for grabs on this one day.
Super Tuesday is a popular day to hold a primary because so many states want an early say in who gets the nomination. So they've clustered as early as they can without stealing any thunder from the first four states.
When is Super Tuesday?
It's today, March 3. 
Vermont's polls close first at 7 p.m. Eastern, and California's last at 11 p.m. Eastern. We won't know all the results Tuesday, because the tabulating of votes could go late into the night. California's final results will take days, at least, as mail-in ballots must be postmarked by primary day.
How many delegates are at stake? 
Fourteen states and one territory vote, to award a total of 1,357 delegates.
It's the delegate total that counts when figuring out who wins a party's presidential nomination. The first candidate to get a majority of the nearly 4,000 delegates wins the nomination. Before Super Tuesday, less than 5 percent of delegates will have been allotted. After: 38 percent. The day is even more consequential this year because California, with its big delegate haul, moved its primary up. 
Why is it especially important this year?
The race did narrow in the last couple of days.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has seized the lead in the liberal lane, in delegates and in recent national polling.
The competition in the other lane, for a more moderate alternative to Sanders, remains muddled. Former vice president Joe Biden won in South Carolina on Saturday, putting him in the driver's seat for that. Shortly afterward, three candidates dropped out of the race - former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and investor Tom Steyer.
When the not-Sanders competition was still so murky in late 2019, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg jumped in the race. Super Tuesday is the first time he will appear on presidential ballots. His late entry strategy was to skip the early states, and he has spent hundreds of millions of his own money on campaign ads. His standing in the polls rose, making his candidacy one more wild card in this race.
The candidates' strategies 
Sanders is making a big play for California, and polling suggests it could pay off. But lots has happened in the race in the few days before Super Tuesday, and Biden was already polling well enough in California to contend for some of the state's delegates. That becomes more likely if Buttigieg's and Klobuchar's former supporters boost him. 
The candidates are also focused on Texas and a thriving Democratic Party there. A CNN poll released Friday found Sanders with a big lead in both California and Texas.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is still in the race despite not having won any contests so far, and she is hoping to at least win her home state.
Bloomberg specifically tailored his message to appeal to black voters in states like North Carolina. A poll in the state released Friday shows him bunched up with Sanders and Biden. But some of his supporters fear that if Biden does well with black voters, it could ding Bloomberg's chances in the South on Super Tuesday.
A brief history of Super Tuesday 
It was born out of a desire by Democrats in the 1980s to nominate a moderate candidate, said Richard Berg-Andersson of the Green Papers blog. In 1984, Democrats nominated Walter Mondale, who got crushed in the general election. For the next election, Southern states moved their primaries en masse to March to try to have the more conservative wing of their party chime in sooner. (It didn't work: Democrats nominated then-Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, also a liberal, who also lost.)
Today, Super Tuesday is more geographically diverse. Each state wants a say early in the nominating contest.
Super Tuesday can be decisive and signal the end of a primary, like it was for both parties in 2000, said Josh Putnam, a political science professor who runs the elections blog Frontloading HQ. ""But they can also show whether things are evenly divided or evenly enough to keep primary season going for a longer time,"" he said in an email.

It may be hard to believe - does it feel as if we haven't had a chance to see the candidates square off against each other? - but the biggest change in presidential primaries over the past decade is the dramatic reduction in the number of debates.
In 2008, the Democratic candidates debated 26 times, while Republicans faced off 21 times. In 2012, Republicans debated 20 times. But in 2016, the candidates debated roughly half as often, and the Democrats are on a similar pace this cycle.
The reduction started after Mitt Romney's 2012 loss to Barack Obama. The Republican National Committee's post-election autopsy called the number of debates ""ridiculous"" because ""they're taking candidates away from other important campaign activities"" - namely, fundraising to pay for TV ads. 
In an attempt to protect future front-runners, the RNC sanctioned a limited number of debates in 2016 - a move establishment Democrats supporting Hillary Clinton were happy to follow. The problem is that voters often make decisions based on what they see of the candidates in authentic, unscripted moments; that's why campaigns value earned media so much more than paid media, and why the debates are do-or-die events. It is clear that voters feel they get something out of the debates, given that their ratings can reach NFL levels: 19.7 million people watched the Democrats' Las Vegas faceoff.
Limiting debates deprives talented newcomers of opportunities to break through. In 2016, my then-boss, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), did very well in each of the early showdowns, but our campaign always lost momentum in the weeks between them. This time, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) did well in some debates but couldn't build enough momentum to get to the top tier. More debates early in the process could give underdogs a chance to break out.
Early debates can also winnow the field and improve later debates. In the 2012 election, several Republicans with high expectations - including another former boss, Tim Pawlenty - were derailed early after poor debate performances. As a result, the final debate on Fox News before the Iowa caucuses featured a reasonable seven candidates. In contrast, Fox News invited 12 Republicans to debate before the 2016 caucuses, and it was a circus (spilling onto a second stage). 
In addition to more debates, the parties should allow more formats. Right now, the only time candidates face off is when everybody is invited, resulting in crowded, raucous, multistage competitions for airtime. Under looser rules, independent groups and media outlets could host unique debates among a variety of candidates - Emily's List, for example, which supports pro-choice Democratic women, could host a debate for just the female candidates.
The ultimate irony of the parties' debate limits? The establishment favorites haven't been protected, as the parties had hoped. Instead, the beneficiaries have been Donald Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).

His ouster would leave in place Supreme Court justices, policies and a party he defined, says scholar

Among the least convincing of the mainly irrelevant or disingenuous arguments asserted by President Trump's legal team during his Senate impeachment trial is that Trump's removal from office would amount to 'a brazen and unlawful attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election,' as White House lawyers Jay Sekulow and Pat Cipollone put it.
Swallowing this argument requires overlooking that the Constitution provides the American people with the ability to remove as well as to elect their chief executive, specifically through impeachment. And in the event of Trump's ejection, the presidency would go to his 2016 Republican running mate, Vice President Pence, not to his Democratic opponent in that race, Hillary Clinton "" let alone to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, third in the presidential line of succession.
Trump's departure would also mean that at least 20 Republican senators voted for removal, which at this point seems about as likely as a meteor hitting the Capitol. And even after removal, Citizen Trump could still run for president this year unless the Senate took a separate vote barring him from holding future office. 
But suppose an alternative-universe scenario in which Trump somehow was forced out of political life. Even in that universe, the 2016 election stands. Three years of Trump's occupation of the Oval Office are proof. For their votes, the Americans who put him there have two Supreme Court justices, the appointments of nearly 200 other conservative judges at all levels of the federal judiciary, a multibillion-dollar tax bill, a massive boost in military spending, the rollback of nearly 100 environmental regulations, and cuts to a number of health and social welfare programs. Those votes would not be torn up, as Cipollone asserted at the trial on Thursday. Those people and policies would not be dislodged. And that is because very little about our politics would change. The Republican Party is likely to remain a Trumpian party for the foreseeable future, whether Trump leads it or not, marked by the same uneasy combination of policy initiatives that mainly benefit the GOP's donor class, plus Trump-style unilateralism, demonization of political enemies and the continuous ceding of congressional power to the executive branch. The polarization that divides American society would only worsen with Trump's involuntary ouster "" perhaps even prolonging Trumpism.
A President Pence might want to return to some of the core Republican beliefs Trump jettisoned, such as free trade, small government and balanced budgets. But even before Trump entered the political scene, the Republicans were becoming the party of the white working class, for whom traditional GOP policies held little appeal. Such voters would push back hard against any leader of their party who may wish to tout the benefits of globalization, privatize or significantly cut entitlements like Social Security and Medicare that greatly benefit the white working class, or provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants along the lines of the amnesty Ronald Reagan offered through 1986's immigration reform.
The reality is that it will be a long time, if ever, before we see a return to a Reaganite Republican Party, so long as the party retains its base among the non-college-educated whites who now make up 6 out of 10 Republican voters. Trump rebranded the party around their economic, cultural and racial resentments. This intensified the devotion of such voters to their 'maximum leader' but accelerated the departure of the college-educated suburban voters who once reliably voted Republican. It will be exceptionally difficult for post-Trump GOP leaders to change that dynamic, even if they understand the perils of alienating the rest of society outside of the party's shrinking demographic base.
It's true that a President Pence probably would behave in a more conventionally 'presidential' manner than Trump. He most likely would abandon Trump's habit of savaging his enemies via Twitter and would restore a measure of order to the chaotic disunity that currently prevails in the executive branch. He would be less inclined to openly flout the constitutional and democratic norms that presidents of both parties used to uphold, and more inclined to utter the occasional bromide about the need for national unity. 
But the country's polarization ultimately stems less from malignant political rhetoric than from the widening division between prospering metropolitan areas, where the gains from the booming economy go disproportionately to the well-educated and highly skilled, and decaying rural areas and postindustrial cities and towns. 
Much of Trump's strength as a candidate in 2016 lay in his ability to talk about the problems that lopsidedly afflict those left-behind regions "" problems that other candidates from both parties found it convenient to ignore. These include economic inequality, manufacturing decline, family breakdown, crumbling infrastructure, the underemployment of prime working-age men, and the opioid epidemic and 'deaths of despair' that drove down American life expectancy for three years (though it rose slightly in 2018).
However, few of these problems have been seriously addressed under Trump, and most have grown worse. It's doubtful that Clinton, who was very much the candidate of the status quo and would constantly have been at swords' points with a Republican-controlled Congress, would have had any more success in dealing with them if she had won. To be sure, the United States under a Clinton presidency would not have withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement or the Iran nuclear deal, nor would the Trumpian executive orders, tax cuts or judicial appointments have happened. But nearly all the structural drivers of polarization would have remained firmly in place. In this deep systemic sense, at least, it made little difference which party won the 2016 presidential election. 
A successful effort to deal with these fundamental problems "" and other existential issues such as climate change, the global refugee and migration crisis, and threats to democracy around the world "" would require far-reaching bipartisan cooperation and compromise. But that has become anathema to leading factions in both parties, including Trump's most rabid supporters in the House Freedom Caucus and Bernie Sanders's partisans, who think that as president he could implement his socialist revolution with the repeated strokes of a pen. 
As Ezra Klein points out in his sharp new book on polarization, Republican intransigence has less to do with Trump than with the ideological, demographic and geographic sorting that both parties have undergone over the past half-century. This sorting has made the Republicans more homogenous, with little need to appeal to moderates as well as conservatives. And the increasing concentration of Americans in the largest and most Democratic states means that geographically advantaged Republicans can win elections at all levels despite rarely winning the popular vote, and have little incentive to cooperate with Democrats when they are out of power.
If America's democratic system is headed toward a legitimacy crisis, it won't be because the impeachment and removal of Trump would 'tear up' the votes of three years ago. Trump may have accelerated the eventuality of such a crisis, but he will not have caused it. Removing him would of course make him a martyred god to his followers; his impeachment would be a bloody shirt that Republicans would wave to justify their intransigence for decades to come. 
'They want to nullify your ballots, poison our democracy and overthrow the entire system of government,' Trump said at a rally in Des Moines on Thursday night. Somebody might want that, but it wouldn't have much to do with a vote in the Senate to remove Donald Trump.

After watching Hillary Clinton's defeat in 2016 and the departure of prominent female candidates from this year's Democratic primary race, women in the party expressed hope Monday that Joe Biden's vow to name a woman as his running mate could spell an end to the starkest gender barrier in American politics. 
Women have been tapped twice before as vice-presidential nominees, but with polls showing Biden leading President Trump in a general election, many see this as the most realistic possibility that a woman could wind up a heartbeat from the presidency.
Biden, 77, has described himself as a ""bridge"" to the next generation of leaders, a comment widely interpreted as a signal that he'd serve just one term, meaning his running mate would be even more of a president-in-waiting than usual. 
""There is this invisible glass ceiling that we just saw play itself out in even the Democratic nomination process,"" said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers and a major player in the party. ""We have to find a way to change this construct of there being this invisible bar to women becoming president or vice president of the United States."" 
A person close to the Biden team who was not authorized to speak publicly, and so spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the campaign will soon announce a running mate vetting operation. 
Biden has told MSNBC that it's ""very important"" to pick someone who's been tested via a presidential campaign, suggesting that the women who ran against him may have an edge. Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) have both endorsed Biden, and Klobuchar in particular has gone out of her way to show her loyalty. 
The senator from Minnesota heavily retooled her own campaign in her home state to support Biden and appeared at two rallies in Michigan on his behalf. She noted on CNN on Monday that Biden then won those two states, which will be crucial in the general election, adding that it's ""a great thing"" that Biden is planning to select a woman. 

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has not endorsed Biden, but the two have spoken twice since she dropped out of the race this month. Their most recent conversation included a discussion of her plan to overhaul the country's bankruptcy system, which he adopted this week and touted on the debate stage Sunday. 
The move was widely seen by Warren allies as an olive branch to the Bay State senator, who famously clashed with Biden in the 1990s on bankruptcy laws. A person close to Biden, who was not authorized to discuss campaign strategy, said Biden had been interested in Warren's plan since she unveiled it in early January. 
Biden has previously hinted that he'd be interested in running with Warren, floating the idea of a joint ticket in 2015 as he was considering a challenge to Clinton. In the end he chose not to run. 
The former vice president has ""strongly believed"" for ""some time"" that his running mate should be a woman, according to a Biden adviser who was not authorized to speak publicly about his selection. The adviser added that Biden ""has been eager to make this public once it was appropriate based on his standing in the race.""
The disappointment of many women with the outcome of the Democratic primary contest is palpable, especially after Clinton's devastating loss in 2016. The initial field of more than two dozen hopefuls included several prominent women, including four U.S. senators, but Harris and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) never got traction, and neither Warren nor Klobuchar finished higher than third in any state. 

Biden's move could be a way to reach out to a pivotal voting bloc. His announcement - made Sunday in response to a question during the first Democratic debate since 2004 that did not include a woman - comes at a moment of reckoning for a party that has long touted a commitment to diversity. 
Women have led the opposition to Trump, first by holding massive marches in cities around the globe the day after his inauguration, and then by running for office in record numbers and winning a historic number of seats in Congress, which elevated Nancy Pelosi to be House speaker.
So far, 56 percent of Democratic voters this year have been women, according to a Washington Post analysis of entrance and exit polls. That's in line with 2016, when 58 percent of the Democratic primary electorate was women, and 2008, when women made up 57 percent of the vote. 
During Sunday's debate, Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) were asked how they would select Cabinet members able to advise them on ""issues that affect women's physical and financial health.""
""I'll pick a woman to be vice president,"" said Biden, who was apparently waiting for an opportunity to make this announcement. ""There are a number of women who are qualified to be president tomorrow. I would pick a woman to be my vice president."" 
He also repeated a pledge to appoint the first black woman to the Supreme Court.
Sanders committed to appointing women to at least half the top administration jobs and, when pressed, said he would ""in all likelihood"" select a woman to be his running mate.

On the campaign trail, Biden at various points has mentioned a number of women as suitable running mates, beyond his primary opponents. They include Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Georgia; and Sally Yates, the former acting U.S. attorney general who refused to carry out Trump's order to close the U.S. border to people from seven majority-Muslim countries. 
Others in the party have mentioned Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, whose state will be critical in the general election, and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), a prominent Latina from another important region.
The United States lags far behind other democracies, from Britain to Germany to Israel, in putting a woman in the top job. If Biden wins and a woman becomes vice president, it could acclimate voters to the image of a woman at the pinnacle of power. 
At the same time, the number of women in the primary field, and the strong performance of Warren and others on the debate stage, added pressure on Biden to make his announcement.
""Now that we've seen what a diverse debate stage can look like, it's hard to imagine being satisfied with anything else,"" said Barbara Lee, a Massachusetts-based philanthropist whose foundation focuses on electing women to executive positions. ""I believe that a more inclusive ticket is essential, to energize and mobilize 2020 voters.""
She said the change could be permanent. ""Moving forward, it's hard to imagine a presidential cycle without a woman on the ticket,"" Lee said.
Last week leaders from nearly two dozen women's groups and liberal organizations - including Emily's List, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, UltraViolet and the Sunrise Movement - sent a letter to the Biden and Sanders campaigns, as well as the Democratic National Committee, urging that the ticket include a woman.
""Democratic victory in 2020 will depend on record-breaking participation by women,"" said the letter, which was also signed by dozens of additional female leaders. ""Women are the backbone of the Democratic Party.""
Biden's decision to make his announcement relatively early in the campaign also suggests he thought it was important to send a signal at this juncture. The aim may have been in part to set up a contrast with Trump, who has made various derogatory comments about women.
It also reflects a shift in Democratic politics, where notions of identity and representation have gained power in recent years.
""Until recently, the idea of choosing somebody other than a white man was just not part of the calculus,"" said Joel Goldstein, a law professor at Saint Louis University who wrote a book on the vice presidency. 
When Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale selected then-Rep. Geraldine Ferraro (N.Y.) to be his running mate in 1984, a burgeoning women's movement pushed him to make the move, Goldstein said. ""They were threatening floor fights if they didn't pick a woman,"" he said.
But Mondale made the selection with his back against the wall. The economy was recovering, making his challenge to President Ronald Reagan more difficult, and his advisers wanted to ""reshuffle the deck"" with an unusual pick, Goldstein said.
And 24 years later, when Republican John McCain picked Sarah Palin, he did so after it became clear that his first choice, Sen. Joe Lieberman - a Democrat from Connecticut - would cause a brawl at the convention. At the time McCain trailed Democratic nominee Barack Obama, a historic candidate running an electrifying campaign.
Biden, in contrast, is leading in the polls, so his announcement is hardly a desperation move. And his age means his choice of running mate will get extra scrutiny.
""I think people will look at any pick that Joe Biden makes - because of his age and because of the moment - with an increased sense of responsibility,"" Weingarten said. ""One should always do that about a vice president."" But that's especially true, she said, since Biden, Sanders and Trump ""are all in their 70s.""

COLUMBIA, S.C. - Former vice president Joe Biden decisively won the South Carolina primary Saturday, as the first Southern primary contest reshaped the race and dealt a blow to the surging candidacy of Sen. Bernie Sanders.
The win pumped new life into Biden's struggling campaign, as he became the first candidate to score a clear-cut victory against Sanders this year, boosting his efforts to become the major alternative to the liberal senator. Still, Sanders (I-Vt.) is polling strongly in several of the Super Tuesday states that vote this week, and it could yet prove difficult for any of his competitors to catch up.
At a minimum, Democrats now face the most unsettled contest in decades, with several candidates showing a potential to win delegates after the winnowing process of the first four primary states. The Democratic race goes national Tuesday, when 14 states and one territory will vote to award 34 percent of the convention delegates. 
What's not clear is whether Biden's triumph in a state supporters have long called his ""firewall,"" where African American voters had a significant say for the first time, will provide only a momentary lift, result in a two-person race between Biden and Sanders - or result in a long slog to the convention.
Still, it was a major win for a figure who has been in public life for 45 years, and his first primary victory in his three presidential runs. Cheers went up at 7 p.m. at a Biden election-night rally in Columbia when MSNBC called the race, and again at 7:04, when the channel was switched to CNN. Biden cast the win as the first of many number of dominoes that will now fall his way, noting that some were counting him out just days ago.
""Now, thanks to all of you - the heart of the Democratic Party - we just won and we won big . . . and we are very much alive,"" Biden said in a victory speech that was pointed directly at Sanders. 
""We have the option of winning big or losing big. That's our choice,"" Biden told a raucous crowd in Columbia. ""We have to beat Donald Trump and the Republican Party, but here's the deal: We can't become like them. . . . We can't have a never-ending war."" 
The Biden campaign hopes to use Saturday's win to consolidate support from many of his rivals, hoping that several drop out - which one of them, businessman Tom Steyer, did shortly after the polls closed. ""Honestly, I can't see a path where I can win the presidency,"" Steyer said in announcing his decision.
Biden also plans a series of high-profile endorsements over the coming days. Rep. Robert C. ""Bobby"" Scott (D-Va.) and former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe announced shortly after Biden's win that they were backing the former vice president.

Nearly half of South Carolina voters said Rep. James E. Clyburn's (D-S.C.) final-week endorsement of Biden was an important factor in their vote, according to exit poll results from Edison Research. 
Sanders, speaking in Virginia Beach on Saturday night, sought to put the results in perspective, ticking off his previous strong performances in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.
""But you cannot win 'em all . . . and tonight we did not win in South Carolina,"" Sanders said. ""And that will not be the only defeat. There are a lot of states in this country, and nobody wins them all.""
After congratulating Biden, he proclaimed, ""And now we enter Super Tuesday - and Virginia!"" 
For all the candidates but Sanders, a further winnowing of the field is crucial to winning the nomination. Sanders is broadly expected to come out of Tuesday with a substantial delegate lead in the race, anchored in his huge polling advantage in California. Under party rules, such leads can be difficult to overcome as the race moves on. 
With most precincts reporting, Biden was poised to win about half the vote, giving him a symbolic victory over Sanders, who did not win more than 34 percent of the vote in any of the first three states. Under party rules, nominees need to secure more than 50 percent of delegates to win the nomination at the convention in Milwaukee in July. 
But the continued viability of so many candidates has increased the likelihood that no candidate will be able to secure such a victory with initial pledged delegates alone, setting up the potential for either a brokered convention or a pre-convention horse trading of delegates by the candidates. 
Complicating the hunt for the nomination is former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who has spent hundreds of millions of dollars advertising his candidacy to the Super Tuesday states, after deciding not to compete in the first four contests. 
Although his rise in polls had slowed since his first debate performance, Bloomberg still appears positioned to win delegates in many early states, as he continues to swamp his rivals in spending. 
His advisers vowed Saturday night that Bloomberg will stay in the race at least through Super Tuesday, when he will appear on the ballot for the first time. They cited internal campaign data showing that if Bloomberg dropped out it would strengthen Sanders, whose left-leaning policies the former mayor abhors.
""Mike Bloomberg has not been on the ballot yet,"" said Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey. ""Our campaign is focused on organizing Democrats and building infrastructure in states all around the country."" 
His campaign announced Saturday that he will buy three minutes of commercial airtime nationally at 8:30 p.m. Sunday night to present his vision for managing the current coronavirus outbreak, which claimed its first American life this past week in Washington state.
After Saturday's outcome became clear, President Trump tweeted, ""Sleepy Joe Biden's victory in the South Carolina Democratic primary should be the end of Mini Mike Bloomberg's Joke of a campaign.""
Biden's support among black voters, who made up most of the electorate in South Carolina, appeared ready to lift a campaign that has struggled to find its footing for more than a year. Biden, a national polling leader in 2019, finished in fourth place in Iowa, fifth place in New Hampshire and second place in Nevada.
African American voters are a crucial pillar of the Democratic coalition, and Biden, along with other Sanders critics, have argued that it will be hard for the Democratic nominee to defeat Trump if he does not have enthusiastic support from the black community. Sanders has replied that he alone among the Democratic contenders has shown the ability to electrify voters and draw big crowds from a broad portion of the electorate.
Before polls closed, Clyburn, who has promised to campaign for Biden in North Carolina next, voiced strong criticism of the operation he was joining. 
""If we are successful tonight in this campaign, if he has a relaunch,"" he told CNN, ""I think we will have to sit down and get serious about how we retool this campaign, how we retool the fundraising, how we do the [Get Out The Vote]. And at that point in time, many of us around the country will be able to join with him and help him get it right.""
Steyer had invested heavily in South Carolina, spending $23.6 million on advertising out of the $36 million spent by all of the candidates, according to the tracking firm Advertising Analytics. But the results showed he did not get a big return on his money.
Former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, who came in first in Iowa and second in New Hampshire, left South Carolina long before voting results came in, a tacit admission of his campaign's low expectations in the state.
His inability to build trust among black voters, despite his early momentum, proved damaging in the state, where he regularly appeared at events designed to appeal to black voters but failed to draw many attendees. 
His campaign staff has shifted to a more target-specific strategy for Super Tuesday, advertising heavily in specific parts of the country, like the Sanders stronghold of Vermont and Norfolk, to boost his delegate haul. The campaign, advisers say, is focused on getting to the 15 percent margin threshold required by party rules to win delegates in as many places as possible. 
""I think there is going to be after Super Tuesday a real focus on narrowing the field,"" Michael Halle, a strategist for the Buttigieg campaign, said in a call with reporters Saturday. ""The candidate or candidates who are closest to the margin are going to be able to stay in.""
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), once seen as among the strongest candidates, had another disappointing showing, after finishing third in Iowa, fourth in New Hampshire and fourth in Nevada. But her campaign has been encouraged by a recent increase in fundraising following two solid debate performances, and she has been helped by an outside group spending millions of dollars in states that vote Tuesday to help her campaign.
Warren also won the endorsement Saturday of Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. Weingarten was acting in her personal capacity - her union decided to support Biden and Sanders as well as Warren - but as a major figure in the labor and education worlds, her backing could carry weight. 
The other player in the race is Sen. Amy Klobuchar, whose home state of Minnesota will vote Tuesday. She also has an aggressive travel schedule over the coming days and has been competing on television in several states, both from her campaign and a supportive outside group.
The South Carolina primary provided sharply different guidance for the party than the previous three contests. But the bigger role of black voters, along with broader concerns about Sanders's effect on Democratic prospects in a general election, up and down the ballot, appeared to have given Biden a second chance.
""Look, I'm very optimistic about today, and I'm very optimistic about the process,"" Biden told reporters at a polling place in Greenville earlier in the day. 
He said his campaign had been bringing in ""about a million dollars a day over the last week or so, and if we win solidly here I think it's going to raise a lot of money as well.""
""The bigger the win, the bigger the bump,"" he said.

A gentle warning to Democrats who are newly awakened to the prospect of Amy Klobuchar:
Remember that right now you like her.
The U.S. senator from Minnesota had a surprisingly strong third-place finish in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, and suddenly voters and pundits lifted their weary heads and declared that maybe a woman did have a shot at winning the election, after all "" just not any of the women they'd been paying attention to.
Amy. Amy was the one they'd been waiting for. Amy was the right mix of tough and empathetic, savvy and fresh. ('She finds a way to care,' pundited Chris Matthews on MSNBC.)
A woman but not, you know, the Elizabeth Warren kind of woman everyone had decided they didn't like or couldn't win. ('Her tone/posture isn't presidential,' pundited someone on Twitter, referring to Warren.) An electable woman. Acceptable to the assorted Biden castoffs and Buttigieg skeptics. ('Help me choose you,' that same Twitter person beseeched Klobuchar, dipping a toe in the wave of Klomentum.)
When Nevada rolls around in a little over a week, followed by South Carolina and the rest of this hideous electoral slog, remember this feeling of liking her.
I mention this because there was a time when Elizabeth Warren's tone and posture were, in fact, widely seen as presidential. It was 2016. It was when liberal voters were saying they'd be happy to vote for a woman, just not Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton was too shrill, too conniving. Ugh, her voice. If only Warren were running, they said. They liked Warren. They'd vote for Warren.

There was also a time when liberal voters were saying they'd be happy to vote for Hillary Clinton. She had a 65 percent approval rating as secretary of state. Hillary Clinton checking her BlackBerry in sunglasses, Hillary Clinton unflappably testifying at the Benghazi hearings "" if only she could be our next president.
Kamala Harris seemed very presidential to voters when she was grilling Brett Kavanaugh at his Supreme Court confirmation hearings. If only she were on the ballot! But then she put herself on the ballot, and, never mind, it turned out she was also, somehow, deeply flawed. So was Kirsten Gillibrand, whom some had admired for encouraging Sen. Al Franken to resign until it turned out they hated that she'd encouraged Al Franken to resign. 'You're seen as pretty likable,' a reporter declared on the first day of Gillibrand's campaign, and three months later the Federalist "" a right-wing publication, to be fair "" ran an an op-ed titled, 'No one likes you, Kirsten Gillibrand.'

Ugh, her voice.

Remember there was a time, mid-February of 2020, when if you'd decided Bernie Sanders was too radical and Pete Buttigieg was too untested, Amy Klobuchar seemed like a perfectly likable choice to be the Democratic Party nominee. 

Remember that you didn't mind her mom jokes, or her trying-too-hard rally refrain of 'I have the receipts!' Remember that her bangs had wobbled at a debate once, and that was fine "" you'd made a benign joke and then moved on.
Remember that there were stories about her being a hard person to work for, but you knew those stories already when you decided you liked her. You knew that she allegedly once threw a binder, striking a staffer by accident. You knew that she'd allegedly once yelled at a staffer who forgot a salad fork and that she then proceeded to eat the salad with a hair comb. You knew this, and then you made the reasoned, calculated decision that these acts were not disqualifying.
It's an exhausting Mobius strip of election cycles that we like women when they're in office but find them unlikable when they're running for a higher office. Studies have shown that voters exhibit gender bias in presidential elections more than in senatorial or congressional contests. Studies have shown that while likability is optional for male candidates "" we'll elect crusty curmudgeons if we believe in their policies "" it is a requirement for female candidates. Studies have shown that Americans say they'll vote for a woman but are still influenced by gender stereotypes even when they think they're not.
It's possible, of course, that Amy Klobuchar is just not your candidate, for reasons that have nothing to do with gender. You find her too moderate, or you have a phobia of the Midwestern hot dish.
But there is also a possibility that sometime in the future, if she appears more on your television screen, if she continues to gain in the polls, you might find yourself thinking negatively about her, in the ways we specifically think negatively about female candidates. For reasons you cannot explain, Amy Klobuchar will suddenly remind you of your mother-in-law or your ex-wife. It will feel like she's lecturing to you. It will feel like she's talking too much. 
You'll think it has nothing to do with her being a woman. It will have everything to do with her being a woman.
When and if that happens, remember back to now. Remember that you liked her.

DALLAS "" When Cristina Tzintzún Ramirez meets with young voters, she often asks them to name a Texas Latina who 'speaks for us, for the state.' They nearly always respond with the late singer Selena. 
'She is amazing, she had a brilliant voice, but she's been dead for over two decades,' the Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate said at a recent Latina networking brunch. 'That hurts that we can't see ourselves anywhere in power.' 
Tzintzún Ramirez, 38, is trying to change that, against what remain substantial odds. After a career of organizing construction workers and young voters of color in Texas, she was recruited to run for Senate last summer by fellow Democratic activists who worked on the 2018 Senate campaign of former state Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who lost but came close enough to show that the state's politics are quickly changing. At first she laughed off the idea "" she had never run before and had no desire to do so "" but they reminded her of the need for more Latina voices in politics. 
Just three years ago, Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) became the first Latina elected to the U.S. Senate, and just over a year ago, Texas elected its first two Latinas to the U.S. House: Democrats Veronica Escobar of El Paso and Sylvia Garcia of Houston. 

'There are many moments when I still doubt myself, that I think maybe I'm not smart enough, maybe I'm not the right person to be doing this,' Tzintzún Ramirez said at the brunch.
'I am the right person to be doing this. If we don't step up, then maybe no one else will. We as Latinas are the right people at the right moment in the right state to actually step up.'
This year's Texas Senate race "" which has attracted a dozen Democratic candidates looking to unseat incumbent John Cornyn (R) and who will face off in the state's March 3 primary "" displays the tension playing out in the Democratic Party as its leaders and activists try to figure out what the party stands for, who leads it and, most importantly, which voters it prioritizes. 

Calls for more candidates who look and think like the party's emerging base of young, nonwhite and more liberal voters are inevitably colliding with a desire to win seats and states that have long been held by Republicans but are seen as gettable if candidates appeal to more moderate "" and often more white "" voters.
Those collisions are particularly difficult in places like Texas, where voters of color are crucial to any Democratic victory but diverse candidates have struggled to raise the money and attention needed to become the nominee. 
The party's presidential race has also shown the limits of identity politics. The field was once the most diverse in history "" yet all but one of the remaining candidates, and all of the top tier, are white and many have had difficulty connecting with diverse Democratic constituencies. Adding more complexity, many nonwhite voters have backed white candidates over candidates of color, either due to policy positions or perceptions of which candidate could compete more strongly with President Trump.

To win in Texas, Tzintzún Ramirez says Democrats need to focus on issues that matter to working-class families and register hundreds of thousands of new voters, especially young people of color. She 

has staked out the most liberal positions in the race, including supporting Medicare-for-all, the Green New Deal, decriminalization of illegal border crossings and a mandatory buyback of assault weapons. Last week she cast an early ballot for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the presidential primary and earned the endorsement of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), whose blunt and passionate politics she would like to emulate.
'Let's go make history for Latinas,' Tzintzún Ramirez said in an Instragram video on the first day of early voting. 


The front-runner in the race is MJ Hegar, a tattooed 43-year-old combat veteran who lost a congressional race in 2018 in the heavily Republican Austin suburbs but garnered national attention for a campaign ad about her boundary-breaking military career. Hegar, a former Republican who is white, has been more cautious in her positions and supports a public health insurance option, banning assault weapons and not allowing 'aggressive action on climate change to get overly politicized.' She has focused on winning over independent voters and former Republicans "" and late last year received the endorsement of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which is led by Masto. 
That endorsement angered Tzintzún Ramirez and other candidates of color. Royce West, a longtime state senator from Dallas, called it 'slap in the face' to black Texans and his spokesman accused the national Democratic leaders of 'trying to lock African Americans out of the process.' Amanda Edwards, a former Houston city council member, accused the committee of attempting to 'put a thumb on the scale.'
'Democrats talk about diversity in their party, yet this latest move proves they are all talk and no action,' Texas GOP Chairman James Dickey said in a statement, seizing on the division. 'Last we checked, there was an African American State Senator, African American City Councilwoman, and a Latina liberal activist running.'


Soon after Tzintzún Ramirez entered the race last summer, she traveled to Washington to meet with the committee's executive director and Texas organizer and urged them not to endorse before the primary. 
'I let them know that in Texas, we are hungry and desperate for representation,' Tzintzún Ramirez said. 'I let them know that if they did endorse [Hegar], I would hate for it to backfire on her in the general election to voters of color who had already felt underrepresented and ignored and were actually the majority of the Democratic Party in Texas.'
DSCC officials said that the decision was based on which candidate had the best shot at beating Cornyn, who has held the seat since 2002 yet is not well known in the state, especially compared to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). Hegar got into the race months before the other major candidates and has raised $3.8 million "" more than all of the other candidates combined. Tzintzún Ramirez has raised more than $988,000, while West has raised $1.1 million and Edwards more than $935,000.
Tzintzún Ramirez has been tapping donors who gave to O'Rourke and those who helped support her organizing work over the years. She has been aided by actor Alec Baldwin, an enthusiastic supporter whom she first met in 2013 when she was the executive director of the Workers Defense Project in Austin. She has been surprised that some donors who long supported her organizing work were hesitant to support her running for office. 
'So many donors ask: 'How do we get out more Latino voters?' Then some of those same donors say: 'Oh, I don't think a Latina can win [in Texas],' ' she said. 'You can't want our votes and not our voices.'
Tzintzún Ramirez's identity is at the center of her campaign. She opens her stump speech with her story: Her mother, Ana Tzintzún, is the oldest of nine children from a poor farm-working family in southern Mexico. Her father, Tom Costello, is 'a white American hippie' who met her mother while traveling through Mexico in the 1970s.
She grew up in Ohio, where she says she usually didn't know any Latinos who weren't her relatives and saw how her brown mother was treated with far less respect than her white father. Her parents ran a fair-trade Mexican jewelry business, and the family frequently traveled to Mexico. Tzintzún Ramirez said she often felt pulled between two vastly different worlds and wasn't sure where she fit.
She moved to Texas after high school and suddenly 'felt at home' amid its wide diversity of Latinos. After her parents divorced, she legally took her mother's last name, Tzintzún. 'Ramirez' comes from her former husband, Manuel, whom she divorced in December. 
Her name prompted a dust-up in January that proved the fraught nature of identity politics. The name Tzintzún is not well-known outside of her mother's home state, so she explained to voters that 'Tzintzún is more Mexican than any Garcia or Lopez' and that 'we are the only indigenous group not defeated by the Aztecs in Mexico.' She was joking but was accused of ranking cultural identities. 
'I have always said that there's no wrong way to be Latina/Latino/Latinx,' she wrote in a tweeted apology, 'and I truly believe that.'

At the Latina networking brunch, Tzintzún Ramirez said that for many years she thought her role was 'creating space for other people to speak "" that my story wasn't Latina enough.'
'I slowly got over that and said, you know, I may be a Latina that prefers junk rock to bachata, but I love my people,' she said. 'That makes me Latina.' 
In trying to win over voters, Tzintzún Ramirez urges Texans to think ahead to the general election and the stark contrast that she could provide if put up against Cornyn. Tzintzún Ramirez often campaigns with her 3-year-old, Santiago, whom she calls 'Santi' and talks openly about struggling to pay bills and piecing together child care when she became a single mother. She recently showed her staff members one of Cornyn's 2008 campaign videos, titled 'Big John,' that featured him in a cowboy hat and a leather coat with fringe.
'I do not think John Cornyn reflects the Texas of today. And I think that there is no better way to show that than me being the candidate,' she said. 'Trump is going to run his campaign villainizing, targeting people that look like and have last names just like me. This race is going to get heated real fast, and I think it's going to become the race that really is reflective of who we are becoming as a country and who we're making space for.'
O'Rourke opted not to join the Senate race despite widespread calls for him to do so. His advisers believed that running against Cornyn in a presidential year would be more difficult than running against Cruz in 2018 "" plus, O'Rourke had a strong working relationship with Cornyn and would struggle to cast him as a villain as he did with Cruz. O'Rourke has made clear that he will not endorse ahead of the primary, and he regularly talks with several of the candidates, including Hegar and Tzintzún Ramirez. 
Tzintzún Ramirez wrote O'Rourke's Latino outreach strategy in 2018 "" and then watched in frustration as he waited for voters to come to him instead of sending paid canvassers into Latino neighborhoods, diversifying his staff and campaigning more heavily in urban areas. She credits him with listening to her and making last-minute changes. Many of those who worked on the campaign said that O'Rourke would have had a better shot at winning had he courted diverse communities sooner in his race. 
In her own campaign, Tzintzún Ramirez's staffers are nearly all women and people of color, and she has focused on campaigning in Texas's major cities, especially those with large Latino populations. If she were to become the Democratic nominee, Tzintzún Ramirez said, she would invest much more heavily in voter registration and mobilizing communities of color than O'Rourke did. Hegar's campaign says that it plans to amplify and build on voter registration efforts of nonprofit groups. 

Tzintzún Ramirez said she has long been frustrated that the Democratic Party has failed to fully engage Latino voters. Following Trump's election, she founded Jolt, a nonprofit focused on helping young Latinos and other voters of color become activists on issues that matter to them. Jolt couples politics with culture, setting up photo booths at quinceañera celebrations and pushing young women to see voting as another way to honor their commitments to their family and their communities. Jolt became a gathering place for young Latinas, especially those who are of mixed ancestry, like Tzintzún Ramirez. 
It does not base its decisions solely on race, however. During the 2018 Democratic primary for governor, Jolt endorsed Andrew White, who owned a company that developed border security technology, over Lupe Valdez, the former sheriff of Dallas County who had cooperated with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials and allowed undocumented immigrants to be detained in her jail. 
'Representation matters and lived experience will often lead you to a different result . . . but above all, it matters where you stand on the issues that matter to people's everyday life,' Tzintzún Ramirez said. 
For months, Tzintzún Ramirez has bounced around the state with a small group of young female staffers. A recent weekend took her from a county party meeting in the Fort Worth area where she waited more than an hour to speak to the group for just a few minutes, to the Latina networking brunch where all of the women wore nametags labeled with their super power (Tzintzún Ramirez's superpower was helping others to see their power) to a meet-and-greet in a Fort Worth bar that attracted dozens of former O'Rourke volunteers, and eventually to an intimate gathering with black and Afro-Latino voters at a coffee shop in Houston, where tears flowed amid a discussion of systemic racism and poverty.
'For so long we have had politicians that don't represent us at all, especially in Texas. I know people like to say that Latinos are a minority but in Texas they're not, they're the majority,' said Krissia Palomo, 19, a college student who brought two friends to the Fort Worth meet-and-greet. 'This might be a little bit of identity politics, but I do like seeing myself in somebody that's running for such an important office.'

LAS VEGAS "" As early voting came to a close here Tuesday evening, a small group of caucus volunteers waited in the parking lot of a dimly lit strip mall to get a hands-on demonstration of the software they would use to tally votes during Saturday's Democratic caucuses.
'This will not be like Iowa,' one of the volunteers said defiantly, referring to the caucus process in that state roiled by technological mishaps. She said she was determined to learn how the software worked and avert any embarrassing glitches. She asked not to be named for fear of upsetting party officials here.
As Democratic presidential hopefuls campaign in this fast-growing Western state, the role of technology has hung like a cloud over the process that will help determine the party's nominee. Nevada's place early on in the presidential nominating process is a point of pride, and everyone from volunteers to party officials to ordinary voters is hoping it doesn't turn into an embarrassment.
Nevada's Democratic Party, which runs the caucuses, had planned to use software developed by the same company behind Iowa's botched caucus app. When those plans were scrapped, Nevada had less than three weeks to put a new system in place, a rush to the finish line that also contributed to Iowa's problems.
The party now plans to distribute roughly 2,000 iPads equipped with Cisco Systems security software designed to allow corporations to monitor employee devices. The Apple tablets have a single icon on the home page that connects, via cellular data, to customized Google Cloud software that volunteers saw in person for the first time in Democratic Party offices in the Las Vegas strip mall.
Technology came to the forefront of the country's democratic process after the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses, when an app designed by a company called Shadow that was used to calculate vote totals malfunctioned, delaying results and opening the door to conspiracy theories, voter distrust and allegations of conflicts of interests.
Even under the best circumstances, the tallying of caucus results has been known to stump some volunteers, according to experts and campaign staffers. Rather than filling out ballots, caucus-goers show support for candidates at in-person gatherings, during a multistep process that can involve changing allegiances and dealmaking. Candidates without enough support are deemed 'nonviable,' and supporters of those candidates can back someone else or form coalitions with other nonviable candidates. When it's over, the number of supporters in each group determines how many delegates are awarded for each candidate.
Since at least 2008, campaign officials have used technology to try to better manage the process. But because of the transient nature of national politics, the people who have worked on building technological tools come and go, taking their expertise and even their software with them. Every four years, campaigns and party officials essentially start from scratch, according to people who have worked for the Democratic Party during caucuses.
During the Nevada caucuses in 2008, the Obama campaign created its own caucus calculator using Microsoft Excel, according to two people who worked on the campaign. The software, which did the caucus math, was used to correct the vote in several precincts where errors were made, they said, and that process resulted in then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) winning more delegates than he otherwise would have gotten without the oversight.
But the Obama campaign's know-how and strategy was never passed on to Democratic officials at the state or national level, they said. 'A lot of people who developed that stuff are at Uber and Airbnb now,' said one of them, who is now working for Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg's campaign. That person spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.
Paper results will be used as the official tally in Nevada, the state's Democratic Party has said. Maggie MacAlpine, co-founder of Nordic Innovation Labs, a consultancy focused on election security, praised the party for creating paper redundancies to guard against manipulation of results.
Election officials should use reasonable restraint when it comes to technology, MacAlpine said. 'We're always advocating a return to paper,' she said. Election technology is the one place, she said, where the more tech-savvy people are, the more they tend to advise against the use of technology. The tools needed to secure online elections are 'not even in their infancy yet,' she said.
This year, the Nevada caucuses bring additional challenges. In an effort to increase voter turnout after long lines and confusion in 2016, the party offered early voting as an alternative to the caucusing scheduled for Saturday morning.
Rather than caucus, voters could rank three to five candidates by preference. Those results would later be incorporated into Saturday's caucuses. Turnout for early voting was high, nearly matching the entire voter turnout for the 2016 Democratic caucuses, according to Nevada Democrats, and lines at early-voting sites stretched along sidewalks through Tuesday evening.
Michael Roybal, a 31-year-old phlebotomist in Las Vegas, said that when he saw the debacle in Iowa on the news, he decided to vote early. He waited more than two hours to cast his vote for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) at a local library Tuesday, where billionaire candidate Tom Steyer had paid for a five-person mariachi band and a free taco stand to entertain early voters. 'The caucus sounds like a mess,' Roybal said. 'I think a normal primary would be fine.' 
But the early voting created a new problem for caucus volunteers: more complicated math, with lots of variables around which candidates will make it through to the final tally.
On Jan. 11, hundreds of volunteers poured into Centennial High School in Las Vegas for a training seminar on the new app developed by Shadow, a Colorado company led by veterans of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign that received funding from Democratic political organizations. In the school's all-purpose room, Democratic Party officials instructed the volunteers to download the app to their phones. The app, they said, would be used by the volunteers to count and submit vote counts at the election.
Almost immediately, problems arose, according to three people who attended the training. About half the people in attendance were unable to download the app. Others were able to download it, but it wouldn't open on their phones. The app was not available through Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store. Rather, installing it first required the installation of another app.
Donna West, a retired civil servant who has a dog-sitting business and is also chair of the Clark County chapter of the Nevada Democrats, said half of the problems that day were due to 'user error,' and about half were because of technological glitches. 'We discovered we had volunteers who don't have smartphones, and so they don't use apps at all,' West said.
Eventually, the staffers stopped trying to get the app to work, said Seth Morrison, a volunteer site leader for the caucuses who attended the meeting. 'By the end of the day, they declared failure,' he said. But the party officials weren't giving up on the malfunctioning app. Instead, they vouched for the vendor and said it would be fixed before the caucuses just over a month later.
On Feb. 3, as West watched the Iowa debacle unfold on television, she said she was surprised to hear news reports that caucus workers there had not attempted to download the apps onto their phones until the day of voting.
Soon after Iowa's problems, the Nevada Democratic Party announced that its app was also developed by Shadow and that it would no longer use the app.
Shadow's CEO, Gerard Niemira, declined to comment.
For many volunteers, that was the first they heard that Iowa and Nevada had planned to use the same software vendor to conduct the caucuses.
Now that the Democrats had scrapped the Shadow app, Nevada Democrats scrambled to find a replacement, rather than put the burden on volunteers to do the complicated math by hand.
On Feb. 8, the volunteers again filed into a local high school "" Western "" to be trained on how to carry out the Nevada caucuses. The volunteers were broken up into groups for mock caucuses, using the names of Harry Potter characters, where they were walked through the process.
But there was one part of the training that none of the volunteers got. They were told they would be provided with iPads and customized software that would help them tally the vote totals. The software was still being developed, they were told.
According to Morrison and the other precinct leader, state officials would not answer basic questions about how the app would work, or who developed it. 'Every time it came to using the tool, they'd say, 'We'll tell you about it later,' ' Morrison said. Officials told volunteers that revealing too much information about the software would be risky, because it would give a head start to hackers, who might try to exploit it and manipulate the caucuses. This strategy, known as 'security through obscurity,' is generally discouraged by the cybersecurity industry.
It turns out the party had decided to develop the software in-house using Google Forms, a fact the party revealed to volunteers Tuesday evening.
Google spokeswoman Katie Wattie said the company has provided customer service support to Nevada's Democratic Party, as it would for any paying customer, but the search engine giant has not dispatched personnel to Nevada to offer extra help.
The Cisco software, called Meraki, could also help Nevada officials remotely monitor signs of suspicious activity. Cisco declined to comment.
It wasn't until Tuesday that the volunteers had a chance to see the software in person. In Las Vegas, the party held a voluntary training session at what appeared to be a temporary office in a strip mall. The lights in the office were dark, leading some volunteers to wonder whether they were in the right place.
When a staffer for the Nevada Democrats showed up at around 6:30 p.m., five volunteers entered and sat around a brown table with florescent lighting. One brought chips and guacamole for the group to share.
The staffers, who later shared what they were shown in the meeting, said the caucus iPad had only a single icon with the letters CC, for caucus calculator. When opened, the app asked for login credentials, which would be written down on a folder given to staffers. Site leaders say they were told they will receive the iPads a day or two before the caucuses Saturday.
At each step of the way, volunteers are instructed to write the results down on a piece of paper and on a large poster that will hang in the room during the caucus. The results on paper, and not the app itself, will be used for the official results, the state party has said.
When the volunteers enter the vote totals from the room into the iPad on caucus day, the software will automatically adjust those totals based on the number of early votes that were cast in that precinct.
If the app or iPad malfunctions for some reason, or there's no Internet connection, volunteers will have to do everything by hand. If that happens, they'll be required to open an envelope containing a spreadsheet with all the early-vote totals. The envelope will contain detailed instructions on how to allocate the votes, the volunteers were told.

DES MOINES "" In a packed arena here last week, President Trump focused on home-state issues, mentioning farmers 47 times, touting recent trade deals and taking credit for Iowa's low unemployment rate. 
Trump won Iowa decisively in 2016, and while Democrats made gains two years later, the party's presidential candidates "" after hundreds of rallies, town halls and parties over the past year "" now face a decision: whether to bother coming back.
'I worked so hard for this state. I worked so hard,' Trump said as he opened his rally. He added: 'We're going to win the great state of Iowa, and it's going to be a historic landslide. If we don't win, your farms are going to hell.' 
Iowa has long been competitive, but Trump's nine-point victory and the state's demographic makeup place it at the heart of a central question facing Democrats: Can they win back rural, white and industrial voters, or is the party's future elsewhere?
'How did Donald Trump win your state "" a purple swing state "" by almost 10 points?' Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang said at a Des Moines rally Saturday. 'Why is it that this state has gone from blue or purple to red over the last number of years? That's a fundamental question, and the Democrats have not been addressing it.' 
Some Democrats insist that Trump is vulnerable in Iowa, highlighting his flagging approval numbers and the 2018 midterm elections, when Democratic candidates performed well in areas that Trump had previously won.
Former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg in particular has argued that he can capital ize on those areas. Iowa is home to more counties that flipped from Obama to Trump than any other state, and Buttigieg has boasted of touring 25 of those 31 counties.
'The president is going to be in big trouble here,' said Matt Sinovic, executive director of the liberal group Progress Iowa. 'His approval numbers are down, and every other underlying factor is what points to that.'
But it's no accident that Trump chose to hold a rally in Iowa "" before a capacity crowd at Drake University's Knapp Center "" just days before the Democrats in this state began the process of choosing his opponent. Trump's strength in rural counties propelled his victory in Iowa, which saw the largest swing away from Democrats among the six states that flipped from President Barack Obama to Trump between 2012 and 2016. 

Some Democrats' complaints about Iowa's first-in-the-nation role reflect a broader concern that its demographic profile is out of step with an increasingly diverse Democratic Party that performs best in areas with a larger share of minority voters. More than 90-percent of the population in Iowa is white.
Jim Messina, who served as Obama's 2012 campaign manager, said Trump and Republicans were 'heavy favorites to win in the general election' in Iowa.
While Democrats' chances in Iowa ultimately depend on which candidate they nominate, Messina said, the election is likely to be won or lost in other states. Iowa, he said, is 'clearly below the mid-tier of Midwestern states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.'
Iowa's recent drift is epitomized by Sen. Joni Ernst, a conservative Republican who won her seat after the 2014 retirement of Sen. Tom Harkin (D), a longtime liberal icon. Ernst caught fire that year with an ad declaring: 'I grew up castrating hogs on an Iowa farm, so when I get to Washington, I'll know how to cut pork.'
But amid a Democratic surge in 2018, Democrats retook two of Iowa's four U.S. House seats, flipping a 3-to-1 GOP edge to a 3-to-1-Democratic advantage. But both senators and the governor are Republican, and it's not clear if 2018 is a blip or a long-term trend.
For now, Trump's approval rating is underwater in Iowa, with 53-percent of voters disapproving of his performance and 44 percent approving, according to a poll released in December by Morning Consult. A January poll released by the Des Moines Register in coordination with CNN and Mediacom found that only 34 percent of Iowans said they would 'definitely' vote to reelect Trump.
Democrats say issues such as Trump's efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act have badly damaged his standing in the state. At his rally, Trump spent little time on health care, instead arguing that he has helped drive down the state's unemployment rate, which has been below 3 percent since October 2017, and touting his trade deals.
He also cited a New York Times-Siena College poll that showed him beating his Democratic presidential rivals, whom he characterized as radical left-wingers. 'They have me pitted against every one of the socialists, and we're winning by a lot,' Trump said, exaggerating the narrow lead he holds against most Democrats in the poll, some of which fall within the margin of error.
Trump took particular aim at Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who describes himself as a democratic socialist. 'Under three years of my administration, net farm income has already gone up nearly 50 percent and will now be rising even faster,' Trump told the crowd. 'What are you going to do? You are going to vote for Bernie? You are going to vote for Bernie?'
Still, Trump's trade war has clearly had a residual effect on the state's farmers. Ernst, speaking on CNN's 'State of the Union' on Sunday, said that while farmers were experiencing 'hurt' during the trade war, they continue to support Trump.
'What I heard from one farmer, she said, 'You know what? I'm tightening my belt. Things are tougher right now, but I know in the long run this is going to be better for my grandchildren,' ' Ernst said. 
And Trump's support among the state's Republicans has remained strong. According to a Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom poll released in November, 85 percent of Republicans approve of Trump's job performance. The president's campaign dispatched more than 80 surrogates to Iowa ahead of the caucuses as a show of force aimed at shoring up that support. 
State Sen. Tom Greene (R), one of those surrogates, predicted that the president will win easily in November. Trump 'carried the 93-of 99 countries in Iowa and carried the state by 190,000 votes in 2016,' he said. 'I expect similar results in 2020.'
Kayleigh McEnany, a spokeswoman for Trump's campaign, said the surrogates would be speaking at the Republican caucuses, where Trump does not face serious competition, to get ready for the effort in November. 
'This is an opportunity to work out those ground-game muscles and make sure we have our ducks in a row,' she said. 'We're not ever going to take a state for granted.'
Aside from Florida and Ohio, Iowa is the only state that has flipped between parties three times since 2000. After going for Republican George W. Bush in 2004, it voted twice for Obama before turning to Trump.
In 2016, Trump visited Iowa seven times in the final three months of the election compared with three for Democrat Hillary Clinton, an investment that appeared to pay off.
Sinovic said this time would be different now that voters have seen how Trump handles bread-and-butter issues such as health care.
'Americans and Iowans are furious about them trying to take away our health care,' Sinovic said. 'That has been the number one issue when it comes to these national elections these last couple years, and it's going to continue to be.'

President Trump sought to assure his supporters Saturday that the coronavirus is under control after earlier confirming the first U.S. death attributed to the infection and boasted of the country's great economic comeback after Wall Street's worst week since the 2008 financial crisis. 
Rallying conservatives eights months before the election, Trump mocked the height of Democratic candidate and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, crouching at the lectern for dramatic effect, called Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) a ""lowlife"" for his vote to convict the president on an article of impeachment and described Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) as a ""crazy professor.""
Against the backdrop of a growing global virus and the South Carolina Democratic primary, Trump delivered a 90-minute speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in which he crowed about his political success in 2016, lashed out at his preferred targets - Democrats and the news media - and polled the audience on which of his rivals would be easier to beat in November. 
The response suggested the answer was Sanders.
 Trump warned of ""far-left radicals"" who will ""indoctrinate our children . . . impose a fanatical code of political correctness, bombard our citizens with fake news propaganda and implement policies that would turn America very quickly into a large-scale Venezuela."" 
He called the House Democrats ""lunatics,"" railed against illegal immigration and complained about losing the distinction as Time magazine's person of the year to the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg. 
Trump sneered at Democrats for questioning the job he's doing on the threat of the spreading novel coronavirus. Trump was criticized over remarks he'd made during a political rally in South Carolina on Friday night calling the virus the Democrats' ""new hoax,"" likening it to the Russia investigation and the impeachment inquiry and trial. 
Trump said Saturday during a White House news conference that he wasn't calling the virus a hoax, but rather the Democrats' accusations that he's mismanaging it. 
""Everything is under control,"" Trump told the CPAC crowd, falsely stating that it was the Democrats who ""wanted to let infected people pour into our country.""
The annual gathering of activists and politicians was created in the 1970s to reflect Ronald Reagan's brand of conservatism. But in recent years, the event has become a Trump affair. 
As a private citizen, Trump spoke at CPAC for many years before formally entering politics, but he was never taken seriously by attendees as a presidential contender. 
Romney, now persona non grata at the event because of his conflicts with Trump, was once a darling of the CPAC crowd, winning the group's presidential straw poll in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2012. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) won it in 2015 and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) in 2016 - the years Trump ran for, and won, the presidency.
Now, the mention of Romney's name elicited boos and thumbs-down gestures from the crowd as Trump assailed the 2012 GOP presidential nominee. 
Romney, the only Republican to vote to convict Trump on the abuse of power article of impeachment, said the president's actions were ""grievously wrong"" in pressuring Ukraine to investigate domestic political rivals, including former vice president Joe Biden.
Anne Copp, a former state representative in New Hampshire, voted for Romney in 2008 and 2012, but said she was very upset by his ""grandstanding"" vote on impeachment. 
She said she liked that Trump criticized him during his speech. 
""His political career and aspirations are over,"" she said of Romney. 
Wearing a rhinestone Trump pin, Copp, 59, said she cried multiple times during Trump's speech because she was so moved. 
A lifelong Republican, she said she is worried about the increasing popularity of socialism in the United States - especially among young people. 
But she said there are enough people who recognize the dangers posed by socialism that she thinks Sanders would be the easiest candidate for Trump to beat.
The audience booed when images of Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) flashed on the screen and booed at the mention of socialism. 
Trump basked in chants of ""four more years"" as he disparaged the Democratic presidential candidates one by one. 
He described a recent Democratic debate in which Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) challenged Bloomberg on his record, marveling at her success and describing Bloomberg's performance as the worst. Trump claimed that Biden couldn't put words together and that if he were elected, others would be running the country while ""he'll be sitting in a home somewhere.""
He repeated a crowd-driven poll from his rally Friday night in asking the audience to determine the easier candidate for him to beat, ""Sleepy Joe"" Biden or ""Crazy Bernie."" 
This crowd, like the one in South Carolina, cheered loudest for Sanders. The only difference was that in South Carolina, Trump urged Republicans to vote for Sanders in their state's Democratic primary - which allows anyone regardless of party to vote. 
But not every Republican is confident that Sanders will be easy to beat. 
Ken Gosnell, 47, who runs his own consulting business in Frederick, Md., said he's concerned about Sanders's strong following but also said he is confident that Trump will win on his record - especially on the strong economy and family values. 
Gosnell's wife was adorned in a short-sleeve dress with TRUMP 2020 emblazoned over it. 
Trump ended his speech vowing to save America before embracing a U.S. flag, kissing it and mouthing three times, ""I love you, baby.""

State senator, 2 delegates among 24 on ballot in Democratic primary 

A firebrand liberal. A veteran legislative leader. A doctor who sees public service as 'a calling.'
Three Maryland state lawmakers are seeking the Democratic nomination to succeed the late congressman Elijah E. Cummings, even as his widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, and his close friend, Kweisi Mfume, occupy the spotlight.

State Sen. Jill P. Carter (Baltimore City), a liberal former public defender; Del. Talmadge Branch (Baltimore City), the longtime majority whip in the House of Delegates; and Del. Terri L. Hill (Howard), a plastic surgeon, are proven vote-getters in their districts who say they can turn out a winning coalition for the Feb. 4 primary.
Turnout is expected to be low when voters select Democratic and Republican nominees for the April 28 special election, which will determine who serves the remainder of Cummings's term representing Maryland's deep-blue 7th Congressional District.
Democrats and Republicans will also compete for their party's nomination to serve a full two-year term on April 28, the day of Maryland's presidential primary. The nominees will face off in November.
Rockeymoore Cummings, a former state party chair who appears frequently on cable news shows, and Mfume, a former NAACP president who held the 7th District seat before Cummings, have the strongest national profiles in a field that includes 24 Democrats.
But Branch, Carter and Hill have all won elections in recent years, in districts that overlap with the 7th.
Each is hoping to edge past Rockeymoore Cummings and Mfume. Less of a factor is a fourth state lawmaker who will also appear on the ballot, Del. Jay Jalisi (Baltimore County), who was formally reprimanded in the General Assembly last year after reports that he had mistreated his legislative staff.
'I knew that if I didn't do this now, that it wouldn't happen in my lifetime,' Branch said in an interview.
At a recent forum at Soul Harvest Church and Ministries in Baltimore, he told voters that he wanted to take his 25 years of experience in Annapolis to Washington 'and bring the bacon back home for you.'
Here is an introduction to Branch, Carter and Hill.
Jill Carter: 'Unapologetic progressive'

Fiery and confident, Carter, 55, has staked out a position left-of-center.
She was a delegate for Sen. Bernie Sanders in the 2016 presidential primary, in a state that strongly backed Hillary Clinton. She supports Medicare-for-all and the Green New Deal, a sweeping set of policy goals that aims to cut greenhouse-gas emissions to net zero over 10 years and guarantees jobs for all.
During her first years in the House of Delegates, she voted against a bill that would have required anyone who was arrested to submit DNA samples. She also pushed back hard against then-Baltimore Mayor Martin O'Malley's 'zero tolerance' policing policies, which led to what she calls 'mass illegal arrests' for offenses such as loitering and littering.
As a senator, her public questioning of deals between the University of Maryland Medical System and its board members last year led to multiple resignations within the system, and triggered the departure of Baltimore Mayor Catherine E. Pugh.

'It is moderate and passive Democrats and Republicans that have gotten us into the mess we're in and completely corrupted our political system,' Carter said during the forum. She described herself to the audience as an 'unapologetic progressive Democrat,' and said she was inspired to public service by her father, the late civil rights leader Walter P. Carter.
Carter served in the House of Delegates from 2003 to 2017, then resigned to serve as director of Pugh's civil rights office, overseeing police brutality allegations, among other duties.
She returned to Annapolis the following year, when Gov. Larry Hogan (R) appointed her to serve the remaining Senate term of Nathaniel T. Oaks, who had been indicted on federal corruption charges.
Carter won a full Senate term later that year, after a primary contest with O'Malley's son-in-law, J.D. Merrill, who accused her of poor attendance as a delegate. She garnered about 10,067 votes, compared to Merrill's 7,097, results show.

She has the most robust social media strategy of the field and said she hopes her supporters' enthusiastic digital presence translates to votes.
Talmadge Branch: Deep knowledge of politics

Branch, 63, the House majority whip since 2008, says he is running on his record of working with Democrats and Republicans "" sometimes behind the scenes "" to pass legislation.
The murder of his 22-year-old grandson, Tyrone Ray, outside a Baltimore convenience store in 2017, prompted Branch to push to add $3.6-million to expand the city's Safe Streets program from three locations to about nine.
He was previously chair of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland and vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee.
Branch was first elected to the House of Delegates in 1994, while Cummings was speaker pro tem. He supported Cummings's first campaign for Congress, when Mfume gave up the seat to run the NAACP.
A reserved pragmatist, Branch says he learned how Washington works in the 1980s, as special assistant to congressman Parren Mitchell. Mitchell held the 7th District seat before Cummings and was the first African American elected to Congress from Maryland.
Branch said he thought about running for Congress for decades and watched as friends from West Baltimore held the seat "" first Mitchell, followed by Mfume and then Cummings. He said he believes his roots in East Baltimore, where he has lived since childhood, may help his chances in this campaign.
If Mfume and Carter split the West Baltimore vote, Rockeymoore Cummings wins Baltimore County and Hill wins Howard County, his campaign theorizes, he could win the seat on the strength of the vote in the eastern part of the city.
Branch won his last primary election with 6,394 votes, in a field of 11 candidates, results show.
Terri Hill: Physician and a problem-solver

As a physician, Hill, 60, said she can bring her health-care expertise to Washington to address the ballooning cost of insurance and prescription drugs. She likes to tell audiences that Congress doesn't need more lawyers, career politicians and policy experts.
'I think that resonates with people, because not only is health care the No. 1 issue across America, particularly with Democrats, but we are dealing with health as a crisis in other ways, too,' she said in an interview.
A delegate since 2015, Hill last year sponsored a key amendment to prescription drug affordability legislation that caps what the state will pay for drugs, a concern she said she hears from patients daily.
She is also working with state and national groups to improve her bill to ban tackling in youth football, which failed to pass in past sessions.
She won 9,920 votes in her 2018 primary election, results show.

Hill lived in Philadelphia until age 10, when her parents were drawn to Columbia by the promise of an economically and socially diverse community.

She attended public school in Howard County, worked as an intern in the office of then-Sen. Paul Sarbanes, graduated from Harvard University with a degree in bioelectric engineering and earned her medical degree in 1985 from Columbia University.
Today, she lives in Columbia. Although her base of support is in Howard County, Hill noted she has strong ties to Baltimore and is a longtime member of St. Bernardine Catholic Church in the city's Edmondson Village neighborhood.
Her training in 'evidence-based problem solving' would be an asset in Congress, she said at the forum, 'because we need to have our problems solved.'
'If you want an experienced legislator, a woman who is a fighter, who is a fierce advocate . . . who has stepped out because it is a calling, then you want Terri Hill,' she said.

Senator is tied for lead in recent poll in a state that he lost handily in 2016


RICHMOND "" The thousands of people who showed up to a rally for Sen. Bernie Sanders five days before the Super Tuesday Democratic primaries did not come to size up the presidential candidate.
They were all in for Sanders (I-Vt.), who was trounced in Virginia by Hillary Clinton four years ago, but who was tied for the lead with former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg in the most recent poll for this year's contest.
'I think that this candidate represents the best chance for substantive change that I've seen in my lifetime,' said Kristin Reed, 41, a Virginia Commonwealth University professor. 'This is really not just an election. This is a movement.'
Also in the crowd was Zhue Azuaje, 27, who works for the American Civil Liberties Union in Richmond. 'As a queer, Hispanic, immigrant woman, his campaign has really spoken to me,' she said. 'He has such a strong, diverse base.'
Sanders began his remarks by apologizing to those who had to be turned aside from the huge gymnasium in the Arthur Ashe Junior Athletic Center. Campaign officials said the fire marshal estimated that 4,700 people attended the event. 
'We will defeat the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country,' he said, calling President Trump a 'pathological liar' who is running a 'corrupt administration' and is 'moving this country into an autocratic-type society.'
'Trump, you're not going to get away with it,' Sanders said to enormous cheers. 'We're going to defeat you.'
As he has throughout his two presidential campaigns, Sanders promised sweeping changes on many fronts, including education, immigration and criminal justice. On the last of those alone, he said he would end mass incarceration, private prisons and the 'destructive war on drugs.' He said on his first day in office, he would sign an executive order to legalize marijuana.
His takedown of the health-care and pharmaceutical companies drew claps and cheers, even as he got into the nitty-gritty of what would be provided to Americans.
Although 'hearing aids,' 'eyeglasses' and 'home health care' are not traditional applause lines, each prompted the crowd to erupt.
Sanders said if young people vote at the same level as those 65 and older, he would 'beat Trump in a landslide, we will transform America.'
'So I say to young people here, don't complain about your student debt, don't complain about climate change, don't complain about racism or sexism or homophobia. Your complaints don't mean anything. What means something is standing up and fighting.'

Ticking off his electoral successes in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, he said, 'That is getting the establishment very, very nervous.' He said establishment Democrats were 'staying up day and night trying to figure out how to stop us. And when they see turnout like this, they get even more nervous.'
Sanders also drew cheers with promises to raise teachers' salaries to at least $60,000 a year, cancel all student debt and make public colleges and universities tuition free.
Before he arrived onstage, Charlottesville City Council member Michael Payne took the microphone to speak of 'challenging corporate capitalism' and 'political revolution.'
Del. Elizabeth R. Guzman (D-Prince William), one of two Virginia lawmakers who have endorsed Sanders, said he first started inspiring voters in the state four years ago, 'despite [the] establishment [being] against us. We had a base, and now we're expanding the base.'
'And we are getting ready to deliver Virginia.'
Sanders visited Manassas in November to boost the reelection campaign of Del. Lee J. Carter (D-Manassas), who, like Sanders, is a self-described democratic socialist. In July, he spoke to a crowd of striking catering workers at Reagan National Airport.
His rally Thursday was initially scheduled for the National, a historic downtown concert venue that holds 1,500 people, and then moved to accommodate more people. He is scheduled to return to Virginia on Saturday for rallies in Springfield "" where he will be joined by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) "" and in Virginia Beach.
 Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) will campaign in Falls Church on Friday and in Richmond and Norfolk on Saturday. Former vice president Joe Biden will appear in Norfolk on Sunday night. Bloomberg, who has plowed more than $10-million into promoting Virginia Democrats since 2013, headlined a Democratic Party gala in Richmond on Feb. 15 and will be back in Virginia on Saturday.

Before the Sanders rally Thursday, one group briefly led a chant to show their dislike for Trump and Bloomberg: 'No Trump! No Mike! Billionaires are all alike!'
The 14 primaries scheduled for Tuesday will be the first test of Bloomberg's unorthodox campaign strategy: skipping early-voting states and tapping his personal fortune to blanket Super Tuesday states with TV ads.
Virginians have traditionally favored establishment Democrats over more liberal ones in statewide elections. Current Gov. Ralph Northam beat former congressman Tom Perriello handily (56 to 44) for the party's gubernatorial primary in 2017. 
A year before that, Clinton won 64 percent of the vote, compared with 35 percent for Sanders.
But Sanders could have more success in the state this year if Biden, Bloomberg, Klobuchar and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg splinter the moderate vote.
Malachy McKenna, 40, said he is a strong Sanders supporter, and considers other candidates he likes to be Sanders knockoffs.
'I just think he's got a long, proven record for always speaking out for the working men and women,' said McKenna, who owns a small business that supplies yeast to breweries. 
'There's a couple good ideas out there, but Bernie had those ideas first,' he said. 'Might as well go with the original.'

DES MOINES ""
Linda Nelson, a 68-year-old retired elementary school teacher in Council Bluffs, received a notice over the weekend that a new version of the mobile app she would use three days later for Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses was ready for her to test. 
But when Nelson downloaded the software on her smartphone, she couldn't figure out how to log in. She tried one PIN number. She tried the ID for the precinct she would be chairing in the western Pottawattamie County. She tried another PIN number. 'Nothing works!' Nelson wrote in an email to the state party.
Her problems were replicated across the state on Monday, as precinct leaders failed to access the app or reported being locked out as they sought to punch in numbers to report them to state party officials. In one especially stark example, just one precinct leader in all of Scott County, which is part of the Quad Cities region, was able to successfully use the software, according to the county's Democratic Party chair.
The technical setbacks generated mass confusion that played out on live television Monday night, turning the Democrats' much-anticipated, first-in-the-country presidential nominating contest into a global embarrassment "" leaving an international audience in the dark and putting another blemish on the United States' democratic system.
By Tuesday, as state party officials began to release some of the results while apologizing for the failure, the debacle fueled calls for Iowa to relinquish its coveted status at the top of the presidential nomination calendar. 
Attention focused on the state's arcane voting system, illustrated by viral images of intricate caucus math worksheets used to allocate delegates at about 1,700 caucus sites. And it provided fodder for prominent allies of President Trump, including his campaign manager and his adult sons, to question the legitimacy of the Democratic contest. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) took to Twitter to suggest without evidence that last-minute uncertainty was engineered to damage Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
Some explanations for the meltdown began to emerge "" including the fact that many precinct organizers had not been able to adequately test the app designed for reporting results to party headquarters. But questions also remained about why the state party chose Shadow, a Democratic-aligned start-up, for such a high-stakes moment.
The app had been rolled out for testing in mid-January, just weeks before the caucuses. The delay was intentional, according to a state party official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. 
Iowa Democrats waited to introduce the software to avoid giving potential hackers time to penetrate it, the official said, adding that the party chose to keep the name of the vendor secret on the advice of national cybersecurity consultants.
In the end, the problem on caucus night was not a hack. Nor could it be explained alone by difficulty in downloading the software. 
It was a more basic coding error that caused the problems. When caucus leaders started successfully reporting data through the app, a separate system also developed by Shadow collated the information but spit out only partial results, according to a person familiar with the events.
State party officials soon discovered the coding error, which would delay the final count by more than a day and raise new questions about the judgment of party heads.
State party leaders insisted that the vote count itself was not affected.
'This was a coding error in one of the pieces on the back end,' said Troy Price, the chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party. 'But the raw data, the data that has come in, is secure.'
Still, the technical failures became another damaging flash point for Democrats, who were subject to hacks and disinformation in 2016, when Russian nationals penetrated party servers as part of a scheme to interfere in the presidential race. 
The Nevada Democratic Party, which had planned to use the same software for its Feb.-22 caucuses, said Tuesday that it would forgo the app.
Iowa was caught in suspended confusion, with former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg declaring victory Monday night before formal results were released and Sanders predicting a strong finish for himself. Meanwhile, an attorney for the campaign of former vice president Joe Biden, who was in fourth place based on initial results released Tuesday, wrote a letter to state party officials citing 'considerable flaws' in the caucus reporting system. 
Unfounded conspiracy theories coursed through social media, pushed by Trump allies as well as backers of Democratic hopefuls, as Iowa party leaders struggled to salvage confidence in the vote. 
'Even though the reporting was a hitch, there is no hint of and there hasn't been any skulduggery, intrigue or scalawagging,' said David Nagle, a former state party chair who helped lead caucus planning after the 2016 election. 'The party was faced with a quandary: Do we throw numbers out there, or do we get it right?'
Tuesday brought new scrutiny to Shadow, the technology company registered in Colorado that developed the software and is led by veterans of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The company was founded as Groundbase in 2017 and rebranded in 2019 with a major investment from Acronym, a nonprofit digital outfit with an affiliated political action committee. 
Shadow received about $154,000 from federal campaign committees, state parties and politically active groups in 2019, Federal Election Commission records show. Among its biggest clients was For Our Future, an independent operation supporting Democrats, which paid the company more than $10,600 for 'digital communications.' 
Democratic campaigns hired the firm, as well, to help with fundraising and digital communications, including the campaigns of Buttigieg, Biden and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who dropped out of the race last year.
Biden's campaign dropped Shadow after the former vice president's IT team raised concerns about the software it was providing for sending text messages, according to a spokesman for the campaign.
Shadow released a statement Tuesday on Twitter expressing regret for the delay in Iowa and saying the underlying technical issue had been corrected.
In 2016, the state party used an app developed by Microsoft.

Iowa Democrats paid Shadow about $63,000 in two installments in November and December, records show. Nevada also made payments through the end of last year. 
'Back in late 2019, they said there would be an app coming out,' said Steven Drahozal, the Democratic chairman in Dubuque County. Beyond the instructions that accompanied the app's rollout, he added, there was little training from the state party on how to use it. 
A spokeswoman for the state party, Mandy McClure, said there were office hours during which precinct leaders could call in for help. 
'This was way too hurried,' said David Jefferson, a computer scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who has counseled the national party on technology issues and said experts had warned about risks posed by a mobile app for recording results. 'They couldn't possibly have enough testing time, and they couldn't possibly test it at scale.'
A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, Heather Swift, said that the department's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency had offered to test the app for the state party but that leaders in Iowa declined. Price, in response, said the party's 'systems were tested by independent cybersecurity consultants.' He added Tuesday that he was not aware of the DHS offer.
In some areas, difficulty installing the app or completing verification with a PIN led county officials to tell their volunteers to rely on calling in their results. As Monday night wore on, the phone lines at the state party were overwhelmed. 
'When our chairs are calling, it's a wait time of an hour and a half or two hours,' said Sean Bagniewski, the chairman of the Polk County Democratic Party. 'In some cases, they have dropped the call.' 
In Johnson County, one caucus site leader who finally got through passed around a phone with an open line so other chairs could report their results, according to Brian Deese, a party volunteer who witnessed the cooperation. 'Pretty much everybody defaulted to phone lines, and it got jammed,' he said. 
At one point, Judy Downs, the executive director of the Polk County party, took photos on her phone of the final results at multiple caucus sites and drove over to the state party headquarters, where she was turned away, Bagniewski said. 
Before the caucuses, the Democratic National Committee had boasted about its efforts to help state parties such as Iowa secure their election processes against hacking and other manipulation. Iowa Democrats scrapped plans for 'virtual caucuses' "" which would have allowed Iowans to participate by phone "" after national leaders moved to block them in August, warning of cybersecurity threats.

Sharp attacks replace wonky policy contrasts ahead of N.H. vote


MANCHESTER, N.H. ""
The Democratic campaign grew newly combative Friday as the party's candidates attacked each other on a debate stage with blistering policy critiques and arguments over who was best positioned to beat President Trump in November.




With no clear frontrunner and four days to go before the New Hampshire primary, the party's leading candidates abandoned the wonky policy contrasts and opaque tonal
critiques that had filled the race before Monday's caucuses in Iowa. The debate stage became a free-fire zone instead, the candidates seizing the moment to call each other out.


They harped on age and gender differences, turned each other's words against each other and warned about their rival's policy prescriptions. Multiple candidates warned that the polling leader, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), would not be electable given his identification as a democratic socialist. 

Pete Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Ind., attacked former vice president Joe Biden's longevity in politics, suggesting the party should not 'fall back on the familiar' and urging voters to 'finally allow us to leave the politics of the past in the past.' 
'The politics of the past were not all that bad!' Biden interjected, pointing toward measures on violence against women, arms control and other legislation he shepherded through over the course of nearly five decades as a U.S. senator and vice president. 
'I don't know what about the past of Barack Obama and Joe Biden that were so bad,' he said.
Buttigieg also turned toward Sanders, saying a nominee can't be someone 'dividing people with a politics that says if you don't go all the way to the edge, it doesn't count. A politics that says it's my way or the highway.'
'Politics should be one of addition and inclusion and belonging,' he said, 'not one that beats people over the head and says they shouldn't even be on our side. If we don't agree 100 percent of that.'
Asked if he was referring to Sanders, Buttigieg said yes. 
'I've never said that,' Sanders responded. 'But let me tell you what I do say. The way you bring people together is by presenting an agenda that works for the working people of this country, not for the billionaire class.' 
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) went up against both Sanders and "" in another chapter in what has been an ongoing dispute "" Buttigieg. 


She reminded Buttigieg of a line he used regularly in Iowa during the impeachment trial in which he called the proceedings 'exhausting' enough to make him want to
change the channel and watch cartoons instead.


After a lively and rambunctious start, however, the candidates also tried to show some form of unity. Buttigieg defended Biden, saying that Democrats should not worry about Republican threats to investigate Biden and his son Hunter. 
'We're not going to let them change the subject. This is not about Hunter Biden or vice president Biden or any Biden,' he said. 'This is about abuse of power by the president. The vice president and all of us are competing, but we've got to draw the line somewhere.' 
Biden also went over to hug Sanders at one point, both of them displaying wide grins. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tried to cast herself as a unifying candidate, as she has in recent weeks, and generally refrained from some of the intraparty squabbling. 
'Bernie and I've been friends for a long time,' she said. 'We have a lot of things in common. We have a lot of things that we differ on. But, you know, this fundamental question about how we bring our party together, we have to think about it in new ways.'




The debate came just three days before the second nominating contest and amid a potential reordering of the race, with signs that Sanders and Buttigieg "" the two top finishers in Iowa "" were pulling ahead in New Hampshire. Biden and Warren entered the evening looking to break out of their sudden second-tier status, as billionaire former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, while not on the ballot or on the debate stage here, continues to increase his campaign spending in the hopes of upsetting the race next month. 
The sudden shift of dynamics after Monday's Iowa caucuses has raised concern among party leaders that there will be no quick conclusion to the nominating process, potentially forcing a drawn-out contest that deepens party divisions and leads to a weakened nominee. 
'I don't think there's any question, after this week, that Donald Trump can get reelected,' business executive Tom Steyer said, repeatedly returning the anxiety coursing through the party. 'We have got to win or we are in deep trouble.' 
Even Sanders, who had more initial support in the Iowa caucuses than any other candidate, admitted that the turnout in the state did not reach the levels of the 2008 election. 'That 's a disappointment,' Sanders said. 'And I think all of us probably could have done a better job turning out our supporters.'

Parts of the party are worried about Buttigieg's limited experience and Sanders's self-identification as a Democratic socialist. At the same time, Biden's claim on electability was undercut by his fourth-place finish in Iowa, and Warren was working to avoid an embarrassing finish next door to her home state of Massachusetts.
Biden, 77, took critical time away from the campaign trail to spend two days without events at home in Wilmington, Del., this week, as he prepared for the debate, met with advisers and restructured his campaign.
Since his drubbing in Iowa, Biden has shifted his message, from one of near-certain electability and broad opposition to Trump to a more traditional focus on fighting for the middle class. Other candidates, however, have been positioning themselves in that role.
'I took a hit in Iowa and I will probably take a hit here,' Biden said in his first answer of the evening.
Sanders started the day criticizing Buttigieg in newly sharp terms, reading aloud headlines that depicted his rival as too cozy with big-money donors.
'I like Pete Buttigieg, nice guy,' Sanders said during a morning event in Manchester. 'But we are in a moment where billionaires control not only our economy but our political life.'






In the weeks since Buttigieg last took a debate stage, his stature in the race has changed dramatically. His surprisingly strong Iowa finish lifted him into a collision course with Sanders here, though by and large, they appeal to different groups within the party.

Buttigieg argues that his movement is more inclusive than Sanders's 'Not me, us' approach, because he reaches out to independents and Republican voters. In the hours before the debate, Buttigieg's campaign announced it had raised $1 million in the previous 24 hours "" a time period, as a campaign spokesman pointed out, in which Sanders upped his attacks.
Buttigieg also challenged Biden's assertion that the party needs to nominate a safe bet "" which Biden defines as himself "" arguing that the bigger risk would be to nominate someonewho represents the old ways of doing things.

'The perspective I'm bringing is from somebody whose life has been shaped by the decisions made in those big white buildings,' Buttigieg said. 'We need a perspective ... that will allow us to leave the politics of the past in the past.' 
While he argues that he is not of Washington "" so he can disrupt the bad political habits that have developed there "" his opponents cast him as naive.

'We have a newcomer in the White House right now and look where it got us,' Klobuchar said. 'I think having some experience is a good thing.' 
Steyer piled on. 'You need to be able to go toe to toe with this guy on the debate stage and take him down or we're going to lose,' he said. 

Business executive Andrew Yang, who has run a cheerful campaign and drawn outsized crowds to his economy-infused message, has limited time left to make an impact. 
'Let me say America it's great to be back on the debate stage,' Yang said, after missing the qualifications for the previous debate. 'I'm so excited. I want to give every American $1,000 a month.'

Klobuchar staked much of her campaign on a strong Iowa finish, but a fifth-place showing means she will need to convince New Hampshire moderates that she is a better alterative than Buttigieg or Biden. 
Biden's campaign, desperate to calm skittish donors and supporters by showing that the former vice president grasped the need for a significant course correction, said Friday it was giving greater responsibility to adviser Anita Dunn. 
Dunn, who has been heavily involved from the start of the campaign, is seen as a potential bridge between two warring factions inside the campaign.

Former vice president Joe Biden swept to decisive wins in Florida, Illinois and Arizona on Tuesday, extending his run of victories on a primary election day in which the growing national response to the coronavirus pandemic complicated voting as it threatened to disrupt future contests. 

The emphatic wins raised further questions about the viability of the campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). It set Biden, who began the day leading the contest by more than 100 delegates, on a clear course to a first-ballot victory at the Democratic National Convention in July barring a seismic shift in the race's dynamics.
This was the third consecutive week of voting in which Biden dramatically outperformed Sanders, including 16 of the past 21 contests before Tuesday's. 
 ""Our campaign has had a very good night,"" said Biden, speaking briefly Tuesday evening on a live stream from his home in Wilmington, Del. ""We moved closer to securing the Democratic Party's nomination for president. And we're doing it by building a broad coalition,"" he said, pointing to support from minorities and suburban women.
 Biden offered a message aimed at unifying the party, much as he did after his victories last week, telling Sanders's supporters that he shares many of the senator's priorities.
 ""I hear you. I know what is at stake. I know what we have to do,"" Biden said. 
In the general election swing state of Florida, the biggest prize of the night, with 219 pledged delegates, Biden was winning more than twice as many voters as Sanders after the vast majority of votes had been counted. 
He won every county in the state, claiming voters at least 45 years old by 6 to 1, according to a statewide voter poll by Edison Media Research. Sanders won voters younger than 45 by just over 10 percentage points, far too little to overcome Biden's lead with older voters. 
In Illinois, with 155 delegates at stake, over 6 in 10 voters said they trusted Biden more than Sanders to handle a major crisis, and nearly 7 in 10 said Biden has the better chance of defeating President Trump in November.
Biden's speech to the nation provided a striking coda to a complicated primary day. As he moved ever closer to becoming the Democratic nominee, he stood alone in front of a camera without a cheering crowd - symbolizing the example Americans have been asked to follow by isolating themselves from others in the midst of the novel-coronavirus outbreak.
""Tackling this pandemic is a national emergency that is akin to fighting a war,"" Biden said. ""This is the moment for each of us to see and believe the best in every one of us."" 
Voters braved historic conditions in the three states that cast ballots a day after Trump requested that Americans stop congregating in groups of more than 10 people to reduce transmission of the virus, which has sequestered millions in their homes, closed businesses across the country and hammered the financial markets. 
Reports of polling place disruptions - with unopened precincts, a dearth of cleaning supplies and long lines in some places - emerged across the country. Both candidates urged voters to take extra precautions. 
The Sanders campaign told supporters that ""going to the polls amid the coronavirus outbreak is a personal decision and we respect whichever choice voters make."" Biden told voters that they should vote by mail or from curbside if possible. 
""If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don't touch your face, and stay 6' from others in line,"" Biden tweeted. 
Sanders made no mention of the elections Tuesday night when he addressed the nation about his proposed responses to the coronavirus pandemic. Shortly before Florida closed the last of its polling places, Sanders offered a long list of responses to the viral outbreak that would cost about $2 trillion, he said, including a monthly $2,000 check for every American household for the duration of the crisis.
Signaling an intent to stay involved in the political conversation, Sanders directed people to his campaign website and concluded by saying, ""I look forward to continuing to communicate with you to tell you where we are coming from, what our ideas are and look forward to hearing from you.""
Sanders was not expected to speak publicly again Tuesday night, according to a campaign official. 
Sanders and his wife, Jane, spent the day in Washington, where the Senate is working on relief packages to respond to the virus, according to a campaign official. Biden met with advisers and public health experts at his Delaware home before his televised address. 

Voting in Ohio, the fourth state that was to cast ballots Tuesday, was delayed at the last minute by Gov. Mike DeWine (R) as a result of the growing viral infection, despite a court ruling that voting should take place.
DeWine said Monday night that he wanted to postpone in-person voting until June 2 and extend absentee balloting into the intervening weeks.
 Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland and Kentucky also have rescheduled their contests for later in the year. Under Democratic Party rules, states have until June 9 to complete their delegate selection primaries or caucuses, and party leaders have the authority to seek rule changes to accommodate states that fail to meet the deadlines. 
Democratic Party Chair Tom Perez urged states to adopt vote-by-mail, no-excuse absentee voting and to expand polling place hours to prevent more delays in the primary calendar.
""As our country deals with the uncertainty of covid-19, it is critical that states provide clarity and not confusion, which could lead to disenfranchising voters,"" Perez said in a statement Tuesday afternoon.
A key question for Tuesday was to what extent voters would stay home to avoid exposure to the virus. So far this year, turnout has increased by about 30 percent over 2016 levels. 
Initial estimates by Edison on Tuesday night showed turnout in Florida up about 8 percent from four years ago, bolstered by a substantial early vote. In Illinois, turnout appeared lower than in 2016.
Before polls closed, the Biden campaign expressed confidence that the results would all but seal the nomination for their candidate.
""It would take a drastic, historically-incomparable swing for Sen. Sanders to win more delegates than Biden today or to close the delegate differential,"" wrote Kate Bedingfield, Biden's deputy campaign manager in a memo issued Tuesday afternoon. 
Biden's team laid out a case that the primary results would be valid, rebutting questions raised by Sanders's allies that the potential for a depressed turnout because of the virus might cast doubt on the validity of the outcome. 
""The American people are resilient and strong,"" Bedingfield wrote. ""We have maintained our democracy through war and peace, economic downturn and prosperity, and in previous moments of public health crisis. We held elections during the Civil War, the 1918 flu pandemic, and World War II.""
Both campaigns have dramatically shifted their strategies as a result of the pandemic, forgoing travel and rallies for the past week in favor of virtual town halls for Biden and a streaming ""fireside chat"" and a ""digital rally"" for Sanders. 
The Sanders campaign said Tuesday that its programming had been viewed more than 5 million times. ""Our digital organizing infrastructure is unmatched, and in this moment of fear and uncertainty, we are proud to be able to speak directly to Americans,"" Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement. 
Biden's campaign also plans to hold virtual high-dollar fundraisers in which the candidate will interact online with donors.
Biden's team is increasingly focusing on the assumption he will win the nomination. Biden himself announced at a Sunday night debate that he would pick a woman to be his vice president. The campaign plans soon to detail who will be in charge of vetting potential running mates. 
Sanders's defeats Tuesday were a reprise of four years ago, when Sanders lost the primaries in Arizona, Florida and Illinois to Hillary Clinton. She crushed him in Florida, winning by more than 30 percentage points, and bested him by nearly 20 percentage points in Arizona. The margin was tightest in Illinois, where the two candidates were within two percentage points.
In this primary, after a string of devastating losses, Sanders started offering blunt public appraisals of his campaign's efforts, admitting that he has failed to convince Democrats he is more electable than Biden but arguing that he has won the battle of ideas and the support of young people.
In the starkest terms yet, he warned Democrats on Monday night not to overlook the youth vote. ""It really does stun me to what degree the Democratic establishment continues to ignore the needs and the ideas of younger people,"" Sanders said during his digital rally. 
But the results Tuesday made clear those strategic recalibrations had not solved his problems. 
Even close confidants said they couldn't predict what Sanders ultimately would decide about his candidacy. He and his wife are expected to reach a decision together, people in frequent contact with them said. 
Some allies have privately speculated that the coronavirus crisis might make it more likely for Sanders to stay in the race. As a longtime advocate of creating a Medicare-for-all system in which the government is the sole provider of health insurance, Sanders has said the pandemic shows precisely why universal health care needs to be enacted swiftly. 
RoseAnn DeMoro, a close Sanders friend and a former head of an influential nurses union, said Monday that the volatility across the country is justification for the senator from Vermont to stick it out.
""Anything can happen,"" she said in an interview Monday. DeMoro expressed disdain for Biden and his supporters, accusing some of being ""out of touch"" and taking ""cheap shots.""
Larry Cohen, who heads a pro-Sanders nonprofit, saw a different benefit to staying in for the long haul: a slow and steady accrual of delegates to the national convention. In Cohen's view, this will give the Sanders movement leverage against the Biden forces when it comes to forming key party panels and shaping the party's approach to health care and climate change. 
""It's a big difference between one-third of the Florida delegates versus zero,"" Cohen said.

MANCHESTER, N.H. "" The two top finishers in last week's Iowa caucuses, 40-years apart in age and representing opposite ends of the Democratic Party's ideological spectrum, are heading for a showdown in Tuesday's primary here "" each taking increasingly aggressive swipes at the other.
But there is an unusual twist to the new rivalry between Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, which intensified Sunday night after the Iowa state party announced that Buttigieg won the most Iowa delegates to the Democratic National Convention, with Sanders close behind.
The Iowa Democratic Party late Sunday released a statement projecting that Buttigieg had probably won 14-delegates to the national nominating convention and that Sanders probably had won 12.
The senator from Vermont and former mayor of South Bend, Ind., are not fighting to win over the same pool of New Hampshire voters, though many likely to vote here remain undecided. Rather, according to strategists in both campaigns, each is trying to energize his supporters by vowing to block the other from winning the Democratic nomination "" with Sanders, the democratic socialist, portraying Buttigieg as a captive to his billionaire donors, and the more centrist Buttigieg railing against Sanders as a 'my way or the highway' leftist.
That effort burst into full view Sunday, as the candidates hopscotched across the snow-covered state. 
At a canvass launch in Plymouth, Sanders accused Buttigieg of being in the pocket of his wealthy donors. 'Our views are different,' Sanders said, repeating an argument he has made frequently in recent days.
'Pete has raised campaign contributions from over 40-billionaires,' he said, adding that those donors are drawn to Buttigieg precisely because he will not, in Sanders's view, take on 'the corporate elite.'
 Buttigieg, meanwhile, continued to paint Sanders as divisive.
 'I respect Senator Sanders, but when I hear this message go out that you're either for revolution or you've got to be for the status quo, that's a vision of the country that doesn't have room for most of us,' Buttigieg said.
At another event Sunday, he pushed his usual critique further, calling Medicare-for-all irresponsible. 'As long as we're willing to have some common sense here, we can deliver the biggest change to American health care in a half-century,' Buttigieg said. 'But what we could do without is a plan so expensive that Senator Sanders himself freely admits he has no idea how it's supposed to be paid for.'
The growing friction between Sanders and Buttigieg comes as both are taking fire from other rivals, who are scrambling to finish in the top three in New Hampshire. 
Former vice president Joe Biden, who finished far behind in Iowa and has slipped in New Hampshire polls, has been attacking Sanders as too liberal and Buttigieg as too untested to beat President Trump. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) likewise has questioned both men on similar fronts. 
But strategists and other close observers say Tuesday's election largely could come down to how Sanders and Buttigieg play off each other.
'Sanders is kind of solidifying his lead among the progressive wing of the Democratic Party,' said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. And Buttigieg, coming from the opposite direction, has become the 'second choice for everybody,' Smith added. 'He's the acceptable candidate across the board.' 
The rivalry has been months in the making, in part because of the extreme contrasts between the two. Sanders, 78, would be the oldest U.S. president in history; Buttigieg, 38, would be the youngest. Sanders would be the most liberal nominee in decades; Buttigieg would mark a return to a pragmatic approach more typical of recent nominees. Sanders has galvanized young people and the working class, including nonwhite voters, but has struggled to attract people older than 50; Buttigieg appeals to older and more affluent white voters, as well as some in rural areas, but he has struggled with nonwhite voters.
'I don't hear people that are saying they've winnowed it down to those two,' said Jim Demers, a longtime New Hampshire Democratic strategist supporting Biden.
That is reflected in the disdain their supporters feel for each other.
 At a Saturday night dinner, Buttigieg criticized Sanders, saying, 'When the president is this divisive, we cannot risk dividing Americans further, saying that you must either be for a revolution or you must be for the status quo.'
'Let's make room for everybody in this movement,' he added.
Sanders's followers in the audience booed and chanted: 'Wall Street Pete!' When Sanders spoke later, he told the crowd he was excited to have won the most votes in the Iowa caucuses, prompting a roar from his supporters. 
'Our campaign is off to a great start. We are pleased, we are excited that we won in Iowa the popular vote, by 6,000 votes,' declared Sanders, referring to one of several tallies in the caucuses, which Iowa Democratic leaders were still examining on Saturday. His words didn't sit well in the Buttigieg section. Rows of Buttigieg supporters rose as Sanders declared himself the victor. 'Boot-edge-edge!' they chanted, enthusiastically hoisting 'Pete' signs.
In New Hampshire, the pair are also competing for the biggest crowds. Earlier this weekend, Buttigieg attracted 1,841 people to an event, his campaign said. Shortly after, the Sanders camp claimed it had drawn 1,981 people to an event in Keene. 









The outcome in New Hampshire could have a significant effect on the presidential contest moving forward, potentially breaking the effective tie in Iowa and shaping the way voters view the candidates in the next two nominating contests: Nevada and South Carolina. 
Sanders decisively defeated Hillary Clinton here four years ago, and polls show he has remained popular, even if his level of support has fallen far below what it was when he was the sole anti-establishment option. Buttigieg has tried to counter Sanders's familiarity with post-Iowa momentum, drawing large crowds and marquee endorsements.
The Iowa results have added to the grating nature of the competition. Both candidates have claimed victory (a winner has not been officially declared, but Buttigieg held a narrow delegate lead even as Sanders won the popular vote). After the state party announced its delegate projections, the Sanders campaign challenged the result, saying it would request a partial recanvass. 
In the aftermath, some prominent Sanders supporters have, without presenting clear evidence, made speculative claims tying problems with the vote count to Buttigieg. 
Longtime Democratic operatives in New Hampshire said that what happened in Iowa has become muddled in the minds of many local Democrats. And the state's contrarian tendencies, coupled with the ability of independent voters to cast ballots in the primary, adds even more uncertainty to the ordering here. 
But it's clear that the Buttigieg and Sanders campaigns increasingly view each other as targets. 
At Friday night's debate, Buttigieg railed against 'a politics that says, if you don't go all the way to the edge, it doesn't count, a politics that says it's my way or the highway.'
'Are you talking about Senator Sanders?' a moderator asked him. 
 'Yes,' Buttigieg said. 'Because we've got to bring as many people as we can into this process.'
Sanders presented a competing view of how to foster unity and defeat Trump. 'The way you bring people together is by presenting an agenda that works for the working people of this country, not for the billionaire class,' continuing a line of attack he started in the morning when he read news headlines about Buttigieg at a breakfast event. 
Some Sanders campaign officials were thrilled with the newly aggressive posture. His aides have been seeking to amplify his arguments. And some of them think there is another benefit to confronting Buttigieg "" his voters might flee to Biden or Klobuchar, splitting up support in the party's centrist wing. 'He certainly has consolidated the corporatist lane at this point,' said Sanders senior adviser Jeff Weaver, speaking of Buttigieg. 'If there's an exchange between a progressive vision and a corporatist vision, the progressive vision is going to win out.'
Buttigieg's aides have also been aggressive, if not always as direct. 'We have exactly one shot to beat Donald Trump. We're not going to do it by overreaching. We're not going to do it by division,' Buttigieg's deputy campaign manager Hari Sevugan said on a call with supporters Wednesday night. 'We need Pete to be the nominee.'
Even before this week, tensions between Buttigieg and Sanders were rising. Many of Buttigieg's harshest critics "" the protesters who interrupt his events to critique his handling of race and climate "" are Sanders supporters. Some members of the South Bend chapter of Black Lives Matter, who followed Buttigieg around the country to protest racial inequity in his city, are also leaders in the local chapter of Our Revolution, a pro-Sanders group. 
The audiences the two candidates tend to draw on the campaign trail are different. Sanders attracts youthful, raucous crowds. They roar his name, rail against the establishment and cheer on high-profile surrogates doing the same.
Attendees at Buttigieg events are older and largely white. They applaud politely. They cheer him when he suggests that his movement is open to everyone, particularly when he argues for reaching out to dispirited Republicans. 
Some Sanders advisers earlier had privately welcomed the rise of Buttigieg, reasoning that there was much less overlap between their sets of voters than there was between supporters of Buttigieg and two other rivals "" Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). 
They figured Buttigieg's ascent would not come at Sanders's expense, which some of them feared would be the case with a Biden or Warren surge. But now, Sanders and his team are increasingly focused on trying to finish ahead of Buttigieg to blunt his gains and avoid being overshadowed. 
Buttigieg, meanwhile, has made Sanders a focal point of his fundraising emails to supporters. 'Can you make a donation today to help us take on Bernie in New Hampshire? He's got one of the most well-funded organizations in politics and has been building his email list for years,' said one that his campaign sent recently. 
There is one unexpected layer to the Sanders-Buttigieg story. 
Long before they were presidential rivals, Buttigieg won an essay contest in 2000 as a teen with a piece critical of compromising centrist politicians "" and praising Sanders for his commitment to unifying. Some Sanders supporters have used the essay as ammunition against Buttigieg on social media. It came up again recently when a questioner at a CNN town hall asked him whether he had become an example of what he had once condemned. 
'What I really admired about Senator Sanders "" and still do "" is his consistency and willingness to say exactly what he believes,' Buttigieg said. 'It doesn't mean I agree with him. I didn't agree with him on everything then and don't agree with him on everything now. . . . And I think everybody "" left, right and center "" ought to come into the public square making the case for what we think is right.'

The Department of Veterans Affairs' inspector general has opened an investigation into allegations that Secretary Robert Wilkie tried to dig up dirt on an aide to a top Democrat in Congress after she said she was sexually assaulted at the agency's Washington hospital.
Inspector General Michael J. Missal, after a preliminary review of Wilkie's conduct following the woman's report last fall, told lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Thursday that he has decided to move forward with a full-blown inquiry.
'This matter is a high priority for our office,' Missal wrote in letters to House Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Mark Takano (D-Calif.) and six senators led by Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who joined the chairman in demanding an investigation.
Wilkie, who previously ran the Pentagon's personnel and readiness operation, has denied making inquiries about the woman, Andrea Goldstein. She serves as Takano's senior policy adviser on female veterans issues and is an intelligence officer in the Navy Reserve, as Wilkie once was.
Christina Mandreucci, a VA spokeswoman, said in a statement that Wilkie will 'cooperate fully' with the investigation, as she said the department did when Wilkie asked authorities to investigate Goldstein's report that she was assaulted at the hospital.
Mandreucci noted that since that case was closed with no charges, 'neither the independent inspector general nor the U.S. attorney has recommended any corrective or personnel actions, or general suggestions for improvement to VA.'
Takano's staff received information this month from a senior VA official, confirmed by The Washington Post, that Wilkie worked to damage Goldstein's credibility following her report that a man groped and propositioned her in the main lobby of the agency's D.C. Medical Center.
Wilkie told his staff his inquiry discovered Goldstein had filed multiple complaints of sexual misconduct while serving in the Navy, according to three current or former senior VA officials. Over several months, Wilkie shared his findings with his senior staff at morning meetings on at least six occasions, these people said.

Wilkie then suggested to several people on his staff, including his public affairs chief, that they use the information he collected to discredit Goldstein, the people said. It is unclear whether any followed through.
Goldstein has disputed filing multiple complaints that she was sexually harassed or assaulted during her military service. She said she filed one formal complaint with the Navy in 2014 when her department head sexually harassed her multiple times. She said he was removed from his post.
In a sign that the case has gained an increasingly high profile, Goldstein has hired Mark Zaid, a prominent Washington attorney who represents the intelligence official who sounded the alarm on President Trump's involvement in asking Ukraine to investigate a political rival.
'We intend to ensure @DeptVetAffairs takes her concerns, - those of other assault victims, seriously,' Zaid tweeted late Wednesday.
Missal's investigation is compounding signs of turmoil at the government's second-largest agency, as Trump prepares to campaign for reelection on fulfilling his promises to veterans.
Wilkie fired his well-regarded deputy secretary James Byrne this month, publicly offering only vague explanations he did not 'gel' with other agency leaders.
The White House does not plan to replace Byrne before the November election, a senior administration official said. It is unlikely a nominee would be confirmed by the Senate, and the president believes Wilkie and his current team can run the agency without a deputy, the official said.
The agency's signature policy under Trump, an aggressive expansion of private health care for veterans known as the Mission Act, is facing ballooning costs since it launched last June, officials told lawmakers this month. They acknowledged they do not know how many veterans are participating and whether patients are waiting shorter times to be seen by private doctors when compared with the VA system.
Wilkie has delayed a planned rollout in Washington state in March of a $16-billion overhaul of its aging medical records system amid technical problems. And an office formed early in Trump's tenure to encourage whistleblowers to come forward with reports of misconduct by senior officials remains in disarray months after a scathing inspector general report said it was failing in its most basic mission.
'We're definitely concerned about the turmoil,' said Randy Reese, executive director of Disabled American Veterans. 'They have culture issues and leadership challenges they need to get a hold of.'
Wilkie's handling of the Goldstein case has prompted a public pushback from several prominent female veterans, who say he has set back the agency's efforts to make women feel safe at VA facilities.
After authorities declined to file charges in the D.C. Medical Center case in January, Wilkie publicly called Goldstein's claims 'unsubstantiated,' touching a nerve with lawmakers, female veterans and VA staff as the agency struggles to provide health-care access and a safe environment to its fastest-growing veteran population.

'I've reconciled myself to the idea that we're not going to get traction,' said Kate Germano, a Marine Corps veteran and author who resigned from VA's advisory committee on female veterans over Wilkie's conduct toward Goldstein.
The American Legion, the largest old-line veterans group, took the unusual step of calling for an investigation into the Wilkie allegations, saying they 'bring into question the ethical suitability of the leadership at VA's highest levels.'
On Wednesday, AMVETS National Commander Jan Brown told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that VA leaders have turned the case into a 'victim-blaming fiasco.'
'Imagine instead of it being Ms. Goldstein, it's your mother, sister, or daughter who made these claims,' Brown said. 'Would you tolerate for even a moment her character being questioned? These women who are brave enough to come forward deserve the same consideration.'
On Thursday, as Wilkie appeared before the committee to answer questions about the proposed White House budget for his agency, Takano told him cultural changes to improve the care of female veterans and make them feel welcome at VA facilities 'will require leadership from the top.'
Wilkie and Trump, with different temperaments and backgrounds, are not personally close. The secretary's supporters in recommending him to lead VA, former chief of staff John F. Kelly and former defense secretary Jim Mattis, have long left the administration.
Wilkie has angered some in the White House by lobbying for other jobs in the administration. But he retains the president's support and has committed to serve through the election, a senior administration official said.
Bob Carey, chief advocacy officer for The Independence Fund, a group that works with disabled veterans and is an ally of the White House, who has known Wilkie for years, called him 'a unique guy for this time with a skill set to get reforms through.'
With a growing population of female veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, VA has struggled to address their health-care needs and ensure they do not face harassment in its sprawling health-care system.
Sexual harassment remains a significant problem at hospitals and clinics, leading to campaigns to stop misconduct in the health system. 
The health-care system has long struggled to hire primary and specialty care physicians who are equipped to meet the unique health care needs of women returning from service.
Wilkie told lawmakers Thursday that VA is currently training about 7,000 physicians and nurses how to provide 'gender-specific' care to female veterans.
During his tenure, VA's Center for Women Veterans has focused less on substantive policy than it had during the Obama administration, multiple current and former VA officials and advocates said.
'It's been my perception that the momentum I thought was happening has stalled,' said Kayla Williams, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security who led the center from 2016 to 2018. 'I'm not aware of any significant initiatives.'
Mandreucci said the agency has 'made significant progress' in serving female veterans in recent years and now provides comprehensive primary care, gynecology, maternity, specialty care and mental health services.
'VA remains focused on maintaining a welcoming environment to all who have worn the uniform, including the 41-percent of all women Veterans who are enrolled in VA care.'
Top agency officials also point to the large number of women serving as political appointees in the Trump administration.

The five Senate Democrats and independent Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) who wrote to Missal this week asked him to investigate not just Wilkie's conduct in the Goldstein case but also to assess whether the agency is effectively preventing and addressing sexual violence throughout its sprawling health system.
'Secretary Wilkie's decision to cast doubt, paint the individual as dishonest, and discredit her traumatic experience demonstrates VA's continued inability to ensure women veterans are welcomed and supported by the country they have served,' the senators wrote.
Missal, in his letter Thursday, told the lawmakers, 'we are closely monitoring the environment of care and facility safety.'

GOP hurls corruption claims at Democrat seen as top threat to reelection

DES MOINES "" With President Trump holding a campaign rally here Thursday ahead of the Iowa caucuses, his allies had coalesced around an effort to damage former vice president Joe Biden's prospects in the state that begins the 2020 presidential nominating contests. 
Republican lawmakers have used the spotlight of Trump's impeachment trial to accuse Biden of corruption, a U.S. senator from Florida is running television ads against Biden in Iowa, and several Trump campaign surrogates have ramped up their attacks against the former vice president as they prepare to fan out across the state in support of Trump's reelection bid. 
'There is a mountain of evidence to suggest the Bidens' behavior was harmful to the United States,' Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said Wednesday from the U.S. Capitol, where several GOP lawmakers used the impeachment trial's question-and-answer session to insinuate wrongdoing by Biden.
Trump's campaign is dispatching Vice President Pence and more than 80 other surrogates to Iowa ahead of Monday's caucus votes. The group includes several Republicans who have launched the most pointed attacks against Biden and his son Hunter during the impeachment process.
Trump's rally in Des Moines came on the eve of a critical Senate vote over whether his impeachment trial would include witnesses. The president has used his recent rallies to criticize several of his Democratic rivals, with Biden receiving the lion's share of the attacks.
Biden responded Thursday by drawing a sharp contrast with Trump in a speech and with a new television ad, both aimed at highlighting differences in character between the two men and previewing a potential general-election matchup.
'In Joe Biden's America, the president's tax returns will not be a secret,' Biden told a standing-room-only crowd at an elementary school in Waukee, Iowa, his first of three stops for the day. 'Political self-interest will not be confused with national interest. And no one, not even the president of the United States, will be above the law.' 
'Character is on the ballot. America's character,' Biden's prepared remarks said. 'I do not believe we're the dark, angry nation we see in Donald Trump's tweets.'
On Thursday, Trump mocked several of his Democratic rivals during a speech that stretched longer than an hour, declaring Biden's campaign 'over.'
'Joe had a crowd so small the other day that they set up a round table,' Trump said.
Earlier in the rally, he decried the impeachment process as a 'deranged, witch-hunt hoax' driven by partisan 'rage.'
After former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, a member of Trump's impeachment defense team, spent 30 minutes Monday echoing the president's attacks on Biden from the Senate floor, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) bluntly assessed the political impact the broadside could have on the first-in-the-nation caucuses.
'Iowa caucuses, folks, Iowa caucuses are this next Monday evening,' Ernst told reporters on Monday. 'And I'm really interested to see how this discussion today informs and influences the Iowa caucus voters, those Democratic caucus-goers. Will they be supporting Vice President Biden at this point? Not certain about that.'
Biden, who has denied any wrongdoing, has responded by arguing that Republicans' focus on him signals their fear that he is the strongest candidate to defeat Trump in November.
'Joni Ernst just spilled the beans,' Biden wrote on Twitter. 'She and Donald Trump are scared to death I'll be the nominee. On February 3rd, let's make their day.'
Biden's campaign has also pushed back against the onslaught, criticizing Republican threats to call Biden and his son as witnesses in Trump's impeachment trial as partisan attempts to interfere in the 2020 race.
Trump stands accused of withholding military aid and a critical White House meeting from Ukraine to pressure the Eastern European nation to announce investigations into the Bidens. In her presentation at Trump's trial, Bondi accused Biden of corruptly pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor in 2015 while his son Hunter served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company.
'Trump desperately wants to impact the outcome of the Democratic primary, dropping into Iowa a few days before the caucus to spread a message of division, discord, and hate,' Biden's campaign said in a statement previewing Thursday's speech. 'Trump has been trying to prevent Biden from getting the nomination since the moment the VP got into the race, getting himself impeached by the House and tried in the Senate in the process.'
Biden's campaign also released the new ad, which runs for one minute and is titled 'Character.' It criticizes Trump's behavior in the White House while describing Biden as a steady leader. 'It's said, 'In here is where your character is revealed,' ' the ad says, flashing an image of the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. 'But it's in life where your character is formed.'
The ad ran Thursday in Iowa's top five media markets, Biden's campaign said.
Although Biden events can resemble classroom lectures on electoral math, the former vice president is wrapping up his Iowa bid by talking less about policy and more about character. Trump, he said Thursday, has led a 'culture of cruelty' from the White House. 
'This is a president who laughs at, insults and demeans other people. He pits us against one another. He traffics in the ugliest lies,' Biden said in Waukee.
Several polls have shown Biden leading Trump nationally and in key swing states in a hypothetical general-election matchup.
Polling in Iowa shows a close race in the Democratic caucuses, with Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg all vying for a victory on Monday.
Trump does not face serious competition in the Republican caucuses, which also take place Monday. 
His campaign's decision to send more than 80 surrogates into the state is aimed at engaging Trump supporters rather than affecting the outcome of the close Democratic race, said Kayleigh McEnany, a Trump campaign spokeswoman. 
'We're not there to shape the Democrat outcome,' she said. 'We're there to showcase the support for the president.'
Still, many of the surrogates will inevitably highlight the 'contrast' between Trump and some of the leading Democrats, she said. 
During a 'Women for Trump' event this month in Des Moines, McEnany and Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law, criticized Biden and Sanders as too liberal for the country.
Lara Trump is listed as one of the dozens of surrogates the Trump campaign plans to send to various caucus sites to meet with supporters and engage with local media in Iowa. Others include Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R), acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and several Cabinet secretaries.
Several Republican members of Congress who have been leading defenders of Trump against impeachment will also participate. Among them will be Reps. Jim Jordan (Ohio), Mark Meadows (N.C.), Matt Gaetz (Fla.) and Elise Stefanik (N.Y.)
'Our Caucus Day operation is just a preview of what is to come,' Brad Parscale, Trump's campaign manager, said in a statement this week. 'This will be the strongest, best funded, and most organized presidential campaign in history. We are putting the Democrats on notice "" good luck trying to keep up with this formidable reelection machine.'
Some non-surrogates are also seeking to influence the Iowa race. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) began running television ads this week in Iowa accusing Biden of 'corruption.'
The concerted attacks on Biden could end up 'rebounding against' Trump and his allies, said Jim Messina, who was campaign manager for President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection bid.
'Donald Trump's focusing on Joe Biden has helped Joe Biden during this primary process,' he said. 'Democrats understand that Trump is worried about Biden. And it helps Biden's electability argument.'

Of all the lessons the mainstream media should-have learned over the past four years, one of them is inexcusably obvious: We're bad at predictions.
Who can forget poll analyses, the infographic needles, the endless columns-and pundit panels that confidently projected that Hillary Clinton would be the next president?
 In fact, it was that very certainty that drove much of the damaging and excessive coverage of her email practices. (Because she was all but certainly the next president, went the flawed thinking, we should get started now on showing we'll be tough on her.)
Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank was so sure, in late 2015, that Donald Trump would fail to get the Republican nomination that he promised to eat his printed column if he was wrong. (An honorable man, he followed through.)
But my colleague was far from alone. And the following year, most media people were stunned by Trump's winning the presidency.
And yet, we roll on today, with very little having changed.
The Iowa caucuses, according to many a commentator, surely would come down to a fight between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. As we know now, it didn't work out that way: Biden finished a lackluster fourth and the photo finish with Sanders involved Pete Buttigieg.
Oh, and surely, we heard many times, voter turnout at the caucuses would be high, signaling the voters' intense desire to replace President Trump with a Democrat. Well, that didn't happen either. Turnout was flat.
Journalists "" reporters and opinionators alike "" just aren't very good at this. Yet they go on doing it, in part because there's so little accountability in political journalism.
'There's no penalty for being wrong. You can just blithely go on making another evidence-free prediction with no consequences,' Columbia University journalism professor William Grueskin said.
He added that it wouldn't work that way in, say, business reporting: If you predicted that 'XYZ Corp will lose $100 million' and then XYZ reported a $250-million profit, 'much of your audience would have a hard time taking you seriously again.'
Part of the problem is our endless desire to frame politics as a horse race. Rather than focus on what's most important to the public interest, political coverage focuses far too heavily on who's up and who's down "" an elusive metric that requires data such as polls and fundraising numbers.
But these things are far from a reliable basis for prediction. What's worse, many journalists don't understand basic notions underlying polling, as data-oriented journalist Nate Silver has emphasized over the years: 'Media understanding about probability, margin of error and uncertainty is very poor.'
If a candidate has an 80-percent chance of winning a race, no one should be surprised if he or she loses. The use of predictive phrases such as 'all but inevitable' should be confined to instances where the chances of a candidate's election are more like 98-percent, he says. (Silver has become more careful since he infamously stated during the 2016 presidential primary season that Trump's candidacy shouldn't be taken seriously. When proved wrong, he followed up by publishing a mea culpa about what went wrong in his thinking, and he was more accurate than most about Trump's chances in the general election.)
Silver's organization, FiveThirtyEight, remains solidly in the horse-race business but with a greater effort now to explain probability and to resist the urge to walk out onto flimsy limbs.
As for me, I'm officially done with making predictions, after flubbing one in mid-2017. New York magazine asked me, along with 12 others "" journalists, academics and political types "" to predict whether Trump would make it through his first term.
Some respondents posited that he'd be gone by now, for various reasons; others were convinced that he would survive and thrive. I managed to get one thing right: that Trump would make it through his first term, but I predicted that he would choose not to run again "" and that Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) would become the first female president. (I'll note in my own defense that this was before she led the charge that brought about Al Franken's resignation as the junior senator from Minnesota.)
Since then, I refuse to predict "" not in print, not in interviews, and not even in informal conversations with friends and family members. 
In a recent MSNBC appearance, the author Anand Giridharadas suggested that, given their generally lousy records, media people should quit the prognosticating game. He put it simply and correctly: 'I don't think it is our job as journalists to predict.'
As we head deeper into the presidential primary season, with all of its temptations, it's high time to heed that advice.

Former vice president Joe Biden is far and away the favored candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination among black Americans, boosted by his personal popularity, his service in the Obama administration and perceptions that he is best equipped to defeat President Trump, according to a national Washington Post-Ipsos poll.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) occupies second place in the Democratic field among African American voters, easily outdistancing the remaining candidates in the race. Sanders is leading among black voters under age-35, replicating his success with-younger white voters in other national polls. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) runs third.
The survey finds meager support for former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is among the leaders in polls in the predominantly white states of Iowa and New Hampshire but stands at 2-percent among Democratic black voters nationally. A lack of familiarity with him and concerns about his experience and sexual orientation appear to be contributing to his current standing. Buttigieg has said that as African Americans get to know him, he will gain more support, but the poll undercuts that assertion. He receives only 3-percent support among black voters who are familiar with him.

The results, highlighting the views of a group that historically has played a significant role in determining the outcome of the Democratic nominating contest, help to explain the enduring strength of Biden's candidacy. Despite questions about his age, his past positions on forced school busing and his relationships with Southern segregationist senators, the poll shows that 48-percent of black Democrats favor him for the nomination "" a 28-point advantage over Sanders.
Biden 'is the candidate that can try to get this country back on track, because we are way out of control,' said Eula Woodberry, a retired school district budget analyst in Dallas, where she still lives. 'He's levelheaded. I think he's experienced, and I think he will look at the big picture. . . . He's the type of person who can serve as the nucleus to bring people back together.'
Edward Phillips, 52, a former legal assistant who lives in New York City, called Biden a 'known face,' adding, 'You know he was vice president under [President Barack] Obama. You know his experience. I trust him. I believe him. I think he's the only person among the Democrats who can defeat Trump.'

The survey, conducted by The Post and the nonpartisan research firm Ipsos, is one of the most extensive studies to date of views on the 2020 campaign among black voters, who, like other minority groups, are often represented by only small samples in customary national polls. It was conducted among 1,088 non-Hispanic black adults, including 900 registered voters, drawn from a large online survey panel recruited through random sampling of U.S. households.
More than 8 in 10 African American adults say the outcome of the 2020 election is important to them, and 79-percent say it is important to them personally that Trump not win a second term, with 66-percent saying that is 'extremely' important to them.
Trump performs poorly among black voters when matched against any potential Democratic nominee. He wins just 4-or 5-percent of black voters when tested against eight Democratic candidates individually. But there is a 25-point variation in the levels of support for individual Democrats in these hypothetical contests against the president, an early measure of which candidates could more easily consolidate black support and who might struggle to turn out black voters in November.
In the competition for the Democratic nomination, Sanders is at 20-percent among black Democrats, followed by Warren at 9-percent. Buttigieg's 2-percent support ties him with wealthy businessman Tom Steyer but slightly behind Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg at 4-percent each and the entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 3-percent.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who is looking for a breakthrough in Iowa, receives less than 1-percent support among black voters, as does former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, the other African American candidate tested along with Booker.
When second choices are combined with first choices, Biden stands at 64-percent, Sanders at 42-percent, Warren at 28-percent and Booker at 12-percent. No other candidate rises to double digits in the combined first- and second-choice rankings of African American voters.
The Post-Ipsos survey's large sample size illuminates the contours of Biden's support among different subsets of the black electorate.
Age is the sharpest dividing line among black Democratic voters. Though Biden leads his rivals by more than 2 to 1 overall, he trails Sanders by 42-percent to 30-percent among black Democrats ages 18 to 34.
Sanders's support falls to 16-percent among black Democrats ages 35 to 49, far lower than Biden's 41-percent support in this group. Biden's support strengthens among older Democrats, rising to 68-percent among those 65 and older.

While Democrats boasted the most racially diverse field of candidates in history at the start of the presidential campaign, all six of the candidates who have gained enough support in polls and campaign donations to qualify for the next candidate debate, set for Tuesday in Iowa, are white. If a white candidate wins the nomination, 27-percent of black Democrats say it is 'very' or 'fairly' important that the person choose a vice-presidential running mate who is black, while 35-percent say this is 'not so important' and 38-percent say it is 'not at all important.'
But Caroline Bivins, a teacher in her 40s in the Atlanta area, said a ticket that includes a black candidate would motivate African Americans. 'Let's just say Elizabeth Warren chooses [Georgia's] Stacey Abrams, I think more blacks would go to the polls,' she said.
The survey offers insights into the ideological diversity of the black community, which has long been a core element of the Democratic base but is far from uniformly liberal in a party that has shifted leftward in recent years.
Six in 10 black Democratic voters identify as moderate or conservative, and Biden gets 58-percent support among this group, compared with 14-percent for Sanders and 8-percent for Warren.
Biden is favored by 53-percent of black Democratic voters in the South, a region where the concentration of African Americans helped both Obama and Hillary Clinton amass delegates in their successful nomination campaigns and could do the same for Biden if his support holds.
A majority of Democratic-leaning blacks (57-percent) say the most important thing they are looking for in a Democratic nominee is a likelihood of beating Trump. One-third say they want someone closest to them on issues, and 9-percent say they are looking for the candidate who has the strongest personal character. Biden leads on all of those.

On the question of which Democrat has the best chance to defeat Trump in November, Biden is cited by 53-percent of African American Democrats, compared with 18-percent who name Sanders. All the other candidates are in single digits. Biden has a large lead as well on the question of which Democrat would unite the country, cited by 43-percent of black Democrats compared with 19-percent for Sanders. The other candidates are in single digits.
Lawrence Taylor, 76, a retired educator and coach in Belleville, Ill., agreed with the view that Biden is best equipped to defeat Trump. Taylor said he thinks highly of many of the Democrats who entered the race, including the two most prominent African Americans, Booker and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), who dropped out last month.
But he doesn't think the same country that elected Trump would elect a black president four years later, if his personal experience is any indication. 'I've lost some friends over things that they've posted on Facebook that seem just outright racist to me,' he said. 'I also have some people that I've gone to church with for 25-years that, behind the voter curtain, I think whiteness checks the boxes.'
Della Anderson, a retiree who lives in West Point, Tex., also supports Biden. 'I think he's my choice for every subject,' she said. 'Health care, everything. I would go with him. I have confidence in him. He's a seasoned politician, he's fair, I just have confidence in him. I would support him because he has been vice president and I feel like he knows the ropes. He's very diplomatic, I feel like he's the guy, he's the man.'

Many younger African Americans, however, are drawn to Sanders rather than to Biden. Terrel Askew, 33, a community organizer in Baltimore, said that in 2016, he believed Sanders was the candidate with the best policies but felt then that the Democratic Party wasn't ready for someone like Sanders. Today, Sanders is his preferred choice.
'I prefer his track record, particularly around housing, which is a major issue,' Askew said. 'And the conversations that he's had around debt, student debt and things like that. And addressing the economic disparities between the poor and wealthy individuals in our country.'
He sees problems that weren't addressed aggressively enough by Obama and wonders whether Biden would be more of a status quo candidate, rather than someone who would take on conditions in the country that he thinks contributed to Trump's victory four years ago.
Asked whether he would definitely vote no matter whom the Democrats nominate, Askew cited Buttigieg as one that would give him pause. 'From what I've seen of him, I get a feeling of ivory tower politics, a person telling impacted people, like poor people, what's good for them,' he said.
New Yorker Edward Phillips also raised doubts about Buttigieg. 'I'm a gay man, but I'm not a supporter of Mayor Pete,' he said. 'I don't think he's ready yet. I prefer we elect a woman before we elect a gay man to the presidency. It's just time we open up our horizons.'

Asked about supporting a gay man for president, 62-percent of black Democrats say they would be comfortable or enthusiastic doing so, while 36-percent say they have some reservations or would be very uncomfortable. Buttigieg receives 3-percent support among those who are at least comfortable and no support among those who say they are not.
And in general-election matchups against Trump, Buttigieg is getting 57-percent support to Trump's 4-percent, with the rest saying they would support another candidate, wouldn't vote or have no opinion. By contrast, Warren receives 71-percent support in a matchup with Trump, Sanders wins 74-percent, and Biden fares best with 82-percent support.
Brandon Gray, 38, who lives in St. Louis, backs Warren. 'She seems to be speaking more to the things I think are most important, like wage inequality. I kind of feel like she's been in politics long enough that she can get things done. She has the clout and is progressive enough without being outlandish. . . . When Elizabeth Warren is questioned on any of her promises or policies, she actually sounds like she has a plan or a road map more than Sanders.'

Biden leads on other attributes beyond who is best able to defeat Trump, but by smaller margins. Nearly one-third (32-percent) say he would best handle issues important to black Americans, compared with 19-percent for Sanders and 14-percent for Booker.
One-third also say Biden has the strongest personal character, followed by Sanders at 20-percent and Warren at 10-percent.
Biden's service as vice president under the country's first black president also gives him entree to many black voters. Fifty-six percent of African American Democrats say that fact makes them more likely to support him for the 2020 nomination, and 61-percent say the next president should generally continue Obama's policies.

The Post-Ipsos poll finds black Americans are highly interested in the 2020 election, with 83-percent saying the outcome matters to them a great deal or a good amount, and 71-percent of voting-age adults saying they are 'absolutely certain to vote.'
But certainty about voting dips to 61-percent among black adults with a high school diploma or less formal education, 57-percent among those with household incomes under $35,000 and 57-percent among those under age 35. All three groups typically turn out at lower rates, regardless of race or ethnicity.
Many respondents said they would be voting in November no matter what. For many, even if they weren't spurred on by a particular candidate, they were motivated by general antipathy toward Trump.
'I'll be voting in [the primary] and November. . . . I would never stay home,' said Steven Mellerson, 35, a sergeant with the New York Police Department.
Gray said he worries that some of the Democratic candidates do not have 'the clout or experience to be taken seriously' in a race against Trump. Still, he said he will vote in November for whoever emerges as the Democratic nominee.
'Either way it goes, whatever opponent is going up against Trump is who I'm going to vote for,' he said. 'I want somebody I believe in, but I also want somebody who will get that idiot out of office.'
The Post-Ipsos survey was conducted Jan. 2-8, 2020. Overall results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5-percentage points. The error margin is plus or minus four points among the sample of 769 Democratic-leaning registered voters.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg spent Super Tuesday with all the trappings of a winning campaign - packed field offices from Miami to Orlando, a ""victory"" party with a smoke machine and disc jockey, and supporters who introduced him repeatedly as ""the next president of the United States."" 
The candidate wanted history to record that he was not finished, even as early results Tuesday showed his support collapsing and former vice president Joe Biden moving to consolidate the same electorate that Bloomberg had spent about $500 million of his own money to win. 
After it was apparent that his dream of taking Super Tuesday by storm would never come to pass, Bloomberg refused to show disappointment. ""Here's what is clear: No matter how many delegates we win tonight, we have done something no one thought was possible,"" he told a crowd of about 1,000 after Biden had won Alabama, North Carolina and Virginia. ""In just three months, we've gone from 1 percent in the polls to being a contender for the Democratic nomination for president.""
That might have been an overstatement, given Bloomberg's poor performance in many Super Tuesday states. Bloomberg set out to test whether a candidate can overwhelm his rivals with limited campaigning and unlimited spending. On the first day he actually appeared on a ballot, the answer was clearly no, and in coming days he will probably face growing pressure to step aside.
It's hard to overstate the importance the Bloomberg campaign had placed on Super Tuesday. His campaign's fundamental theory was that he could ignore the first four contests and instead blanket the March 3 states with enough ads to leave his rivals behind. Instead, it was Biden who found himself telling a cheering crowd, ""They don't call it Super Tuesday for nothing.""

Two weeks ago, Bloomberg's own advisers wrote a memo saying the Democratic candidates not named Bernie Sanders had to consolidate forces to preserve any path to the nomination. But even before voters rendered their verdict Tuesday, Biden had done that, winning endorsements from Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn) and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg. 
Bloomberg had begun his surprise campaign for president on a platform of altruism. His wealth, he promised, would be used to build the Democratic Party up and down the ballot, no matter who the nominee was, with the singular goal of defeating Donald Trump and making progress on issues he cared about. He will soon have to answer to how staying in the race furthers that goal.
He made clear Tuesday night that his aim was still defeating Trump, and that his campaign might still have a dual purpose, boosting his own candidacy and promoting the Democratic cause generally. 
""While my fellow candidates spent a whole year focusing on the first four states, I was out campaigning against Donald Trump in the states where the election will actually be decided like Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Ohio and North Carolina, and of course, Florida,"" he said. 
Bloomberg's spending accounted for the vast majority of the money shelled out by the candidates in Super Tuesday states - about $18 million in Virginia, $8 million in Alabama and $17 million in North Carolina - yet he handily lost all three to Biden on Tuesday. Polling in other prizes, like California and Colorado, was not promising for him either. 
It was a rough letdown for a long-shot presidential campaign that had tried to rewrite the rules of how the White House is won and how much money it could cost. He tried to bypass nearly a year of campaigning in the early primary states, and his wealth allowed him to skip over the onerous process of fundraising. 
Among the other things, Bloomberg's money had purchased a sophisticated data and polling operation that had a firm handle on the state of the country. But like the monitors in the election-night ballroom Tuesday, which switched from cable news to campaign videos before Biden notched his first win in Virginia, the campaign did want to share what it knew.
Only as the polls closed did campaign manager Kevin Sheekey begin to back away from the Bloomberg camp's unyielding insistence that he would fight on until the Democratic convention in Milwaukee. 
""You make an assessment in any campaign like this after any time there is a vote,"" Sheekey said. ""As of right now we are committing to stay in, but we will see what happens tonight."" 
Another campaign aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the campaign is regularly reevaluated, and that process would continue Wednesday. Bloomberg was expected to return to New York on Wednesday.
""Today is a marker,"" the aide said, referring to the Super Tuesday vote.
 From the start of the campaign, Biden had loomed large in Bloomberg's thinking. The former vice president's seeming hold on the nomination had been a major reason Bloomberg initially decided not to run in early 2019. Months later, it was Biden's faltering performance that led Bloomberg to get into the race after all. 
For Bloomberg, the only early result to cheer Tuesday night came from the announcement that Bloomberg had won the territory of American Samoa, taking four of its six delegates to the convention. 
Bloomberg has vowed that the campaign he built will go on even if the candidate himself pulls out, with the goal of boosting whoever the Democratic nominee is. The data program he is assembling, called Hawkfish, would continue its work, aides say, and hundreds of campaign staffers in swing states would continue to work through November. 
The most substantial legacy of Bloomberg's campaign is likely to be his massive advertising apparatus. The political world has never seen anything like the flood of money unleashed by the multibillionaire, and he has suggested that will continue.
Under campaign finance law, which has rarely focused on self-funded candidates, Bloomberg's campaign can pivot at any moment to run ads in support of Biden or another candidate. He has reserved nearly $7 million in advertising over the next two days, which can be repurposed to whatever message he chooses.
Sanders's advisers have promised to renounce any support from Bloomberg in a general election, given the candidate's distaste for billionaires, but Biden's team has not been so discouraging. The ties between the two camps run deep. Sheekey, an early donor to Biden's 2020 campaign, was considered as a potential chief of staff for Biden when he served as vice president, according to people familiar with the discussions.
As Tuesday approached, Bloomberg had begun to appear more comfortable in the role he had chosen for himself. After a disastrous performance in his first debate on Feb. 19, he improved his performance in his second debate, completed two town halls on Fox News and CNN without incident and found the beginnings of some comfort speaking without a script on the campaign trail.
He also was getting better at looking beyond hard data. On Tuesday, Bloomberg hardly mentioned the 14 states where voting was taking place but took every chance he could to talk about the Florida primary in two weeks.
""I have no intention of dropping out,"" he said testily in the Little Havana neighborhood of Miami when a reporter challenged him on his declining fortunes. ""I'm in it to win it.""
But the kinks that had been evident from the start of the campaign in late November remained. 
""I've only been doing this 10 weeks,"" he told some diners in Miami as he made his way around El Pub restaurant, even though it had been 14 weeks at that point. He was dressed in khakis and tasseled loafers, no suit jacket, which he called a ""man of the people"" look.
""I've never run for president before,"" he joked with the diners. ""I had nothing else to do.""

As the Democratic primaries take off, stock market prognosticators are handicapping the race for the White House. Will Mike Bloomberg be good for stocks? Will Sen. Amy Klobuchar or Joe Biden?
Superficially, it sounds compelling. Bloomberg certainly made a ton of money in Bloomberg LP, the software and media firm that catapulted his political career.
More broadly, Bloomberg cares about business. Like Klobuchar, Biden and others in the dwindling breed of Democratic moderates, they've refused to sign on to the progressive drumbeat demonizing corporations. 
Here's some advice: If anyone says a particular candidate (including President Trump) will be good for your portfolio, head for the hills. 
Election gurus don't know who is going to win any more than you do. And even if they did, it would tell you nothing about the stock market.
The most pro-free-enterprise president in recent memory "" a businessman himself "" was George W. Bush. Oops. By the time he left office in 2009, the market (as measured by the Dow Jones industrial average, as throughout) had tumbled 26-percent. Barack Obama, Bush's successor, had never met a payroll and was not above saying unkind things about CEOs. He was loathed by investment managers, and some of them still gripe to me that he was a socialist. Kind of ungrateful, I would say, because under 'Comrade Obama' the market vaulted 148-percent.
Bush and Obama each had to deal with the fallout from the mortgage bubble, and their policies weren't much different. Each supported federal bailouts of banks and automakers, and each supported ultralow interest rates and higher capital ratios for banks. Although Bush's rhetoric and inclinations were far more conservative than Obama's "" no one dreamed that Bush would be investing federal money in private banks "" the policies of each were determined by an unforeseen event (the crash), which mattered more than where they stood on an ideological spectrum. 
Candidates' political leanings rarely translate neatly into policy. Some presidents do stuff that seems 'anti-business' (such as George H.W. Bush's 1990 tax hike) but helps the economy in the long term. Sometimes free-enterprise types, like the younger Bush, are forced by a crisis to intervene. And sometimes, once in office, they discover an unknown affection for big government, a la Richard M. Nixon, who started his career on the far right and as president in 1971 imposed wage and price controls. 
Historically, there is no correlation between a successful candidate's pro-business sentiments and subsequent market performance. You could even argue there is a negative correlation, because over the past century (not counting 2020), the market has risen 14.4-percent per year in the 48 years when Democrats were in office, and 10.1-percent during 51 Republican years.
There are two reasons for the disconnect. First, the four-year presidential term is unrelated to the business cycle. Gerald Ford, who succeeded Nixon in 1974, didn't accomplish much, but he had the good fortune to enter office at the trough of a recession. Result: The Ford market rose 40-percent. Calvin Coolidge was way luckier. He exited the stage in March 1929, just months before the Great Depression. Coolidge investors earned 230-percent but "" honestly "" how many of them got out before the following October? 
Second, and more importantly, stock prices respond to variables that are only marginally under presidential control. This was extremely fortunate for investors during the golden era of Warren G. Harding, whose administration was rocked by a recession and the Teapot Dome scandal, and who nonetheless gifted investors, in his brief two years, with a positive 23-percent return. Perhaps in the 1920s, Democrats were confused that the market rose under Harding "" a genial mouther of platitudes and not much else. 
The dirty secret is that the market is not a referendum on presidential policies, nor on presidential character. Many in my bluest-of-blue neighborhood in Cambridge, Mass., have wondered, 'If Trump is so awful, why is the market up 46-percent?'
The market is not a retributionist god who punishes narcissistic tweeters. It does not punish the profligate or (except very rarely) the reckless. It is not a barometer of morality. 
It does not reward you for being right about the anti-Iranian airstrike s; by the time the aircraft have returned to base, traders are on to something else. And the market does not conform to a political narrative "" nor to any other narrative. It is not a stage on which, finally in Act 3, some hidden truth emerges and the guilty are punished. Trying to discern such a narrative is not a fruitful way to invest. 
Stocks, simply, are discounting machines; they put a present value on future earnings. Overwhelmingly, stock prices respond over longish periods to two variables, earnings and interest rates. No one who invested in Microsoft when it went public in 1986 says, 'Thank God, I invested under Ronald Reagan.' No offense to the Gipper, but he had nothing to do with it. 
Microsoft's earnings have consistently risen over three-plus decades. That's why the stock had been a home run. Like every other investment, it has also benefited from steadily falling interest rates. (The lower the rate, the greater the present value of future earnings.)
What happens to earnings and interest rates will be more important, if you're viewing the election through a mercenary lens, than who wins Iowa in the Democratic caucuses on Feb. 3.
Investing truths are always easier to see on a smaller scale. If you were thinking of putting money into a new business "" maybe a friend has an app "" you wouldn't say, 'Let's wait for Iowa.' 
Whether that app succeeds will not depend on the election. It's not much different for big corporations. If they do a good job selling products and staying ahead of the competition, and if you don't pay a crazy price for their stock, you'll do okay. 
Of course, presidents have some effect. The Trump tax cuts provided a one-year boost, but they were offset by the disguised tax of the Trump tariffs. And be careful about crediting a particular president for policies that might have happened anyway. Before Trump, quite a few Democrats (Obama included) supported a corporate tax cut. Going forward, there is less support for unbridled capitalism and global trade than in a long time. Both parties have turned populist, which will be true no matter who wins. 
Sen. Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist, scares a lot of people. He scares me, too. But the party is tacking left. Biden, the front-running moderate, and Sanders both support an increase in public health-care benefits, an increase in the minimum wage to $15, some years of free college and an increase in the capital gains tax. There are important differences, but four years from now, they are likely to be overwhelmed by events we can't predict. 
Something will happen to jolt the market in the next term (it always does). And the president, whoever she or he is, will have to respond. In the next term, as wages continue to rise, the Federal Reserve will worry more about inflation than many people now realize. That will put pressure on interest rates. And stocks will start the term (assuming there is no break first) in nosebleed territory (24.6 times earnings). 
So I would pay attention to prices and earnings, and, when it comes to your portfolio, ignore the polls. If we elect a good person for the country, the market will do fine, or as well as it can. If you are still hooked on a pro-business candidate, remember: The most pro-business, and indisputably the most prepared, candidate ever elected was a millionaire former mining executive and secretary of commerce. His name was Herbert Hoover.

The Democrats' anguish about their primary system "" Does it vet for the right qualities? Is it too slanted toward white voters? "" is frequently directed at New Hampshire. By law, the state must hold its primary 'seven days or more immediately preceding the date on which any other state shall hold a similar election,' which has stopped some more-diverse states from voting earlier. New Hampshire is 90 percent white, the least racially diverse of the early states, with most of its black, Latino and Asian voters concentrated in a few midsize cities.

New Hampshire has a semi-open primary, giving voters who have not registered with the Democratic Party their loudest voice of any of the first four states. Just 60 percent of New Hampshire primary voters who pulled a Democratic ballot were registered with the party in 2016. The independent streak helped Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) win by a landslide; he won registered Democrats by a single percentage point and crushed Hillary Clinton by 45-points with independents.
The victory in 2016 was the most lopsided in the 100-year history of the primary. Sanders won 60 percent of the vote and all but six of the state's 221 towns; Clinton had the endorsements of every major party leader, including the Democrats who now make up New Hampshire's all-blue delegation to Congress. All of them "" Sen. Maggie Hassan, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, Rep. Ann Kuster and Rep. Chris Pappas "" are neutral in 2020.
The last primary had an obvious direction and momentum that simply hasn't been replicated in 2020. No Democrat has built a lead outside the margin of error since July, before the bounce from former vice president Joe Biden's announcement had faded. In an average of polls, the lead has switched three times since October, from Biden, to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), to former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, and back to Sanders.
In another year, Sanders's proven strength in New Hampshire could scare off some rivals. But this year, in a crowded field, Sanders has never come close to his 2016 strength, shedding more than half of his old support. Without a binary who's-going-to-stop-Clinton contest to focus on, New Hampshire Democrats have been flitting more among candidates, and independents have joined them.
That's been tremendously helpful to Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), a onetime Sanders supporter who is now friendlier to conservatives (on abortion, on whether to impeach the president) than anyone else in the race. It's also been a solace to Sen. Michael F. Bennet (Colo.), who is pitching himself as a president so pragmatic and low-key that voters 'won't have to think about me for 2 weeks at a time.' 
There are plenty of voters here who aren't too liberal but will pull a Democratic ballot. Since January 2017, when the president was sworn in, Democratic registration has shrunk by 3,071 voters, Republican registration has shrunk by 15,554 voters, and 9,529 new voters have climbed onto the rolls with no party registration.
They're in high demand. This is a primary, after all, with none of the time or organizing demands of a caucus state. Late-breaking voters, people who maybe paid attention for only the final week of the contest, can change everything. It happened in 2008, when Barack Obama surged in polling over Clinton in the days after his Iowa win, before key voters came back to her. (Both campaigns' internal polling had Obama ahead.) It nearly happened in 2004, when Howard Dean, humiliated by a loss in Iowa, campaigned hard and cut John F. Kerry's lead in half. The reverse happened in 2016, when Sanders's overwhelming organization made the difference between a win in the high single digits and a 21-point rout that raised questions about Clinton as a 'front-runner.'
All of this happens in a state where most voters live within a 90-minute drive of one another. New Hampshire's tourism department splits it into seven regions, which don't quite overlap with its 10 counties. The vast majority of voters live south of Lake Winnipesaukee, away from the tourist towns, in small cities and suburbs around Boston's media market. There is plenty of political diversity in towns that otherwise look pretty similar; walking from Merrimack (pop. 25,660) to Amherst (pop. 11,201) means leaving deep-red Trump Country to enter a place that abandoned the GOP for Clinton.
The north country
The north country's population is shrinking, and few voters remember a time when it wasn't. Berlin, an old paper mill city, has lost half its population since the 1930s. Dixville Notch, which became famous for its unique midnight vote, found just enough residents to hold it this year.
There are not many Democratic votes to win here "" just 6 percent of the total usually cast "" and there's been relatively little campaigning, even though it's the sort of rural, Obama-to-Trump place they highlight in other states. How much time should any candidate spend in a region with fewer Democratic votes than Manchester? There's a saying, cruel but often followed, that even reporters shouldn't go north of the White Mountains for candidates polling under 10 percent.
Berlin and Conway are the only major population centers here, but it's worth watching who turns out. Berlin, for example, cast 2,741 votes in the 2008 primary, and just 1,896 in the Clinton-Sanders race. If Sanders has been able to organize disaffected voters, it'll be seen up here; if a candidate like Andrew Yang has won over the people who gave up on politics or gave President Trump a chance in 2016, he'll do well in Coos and Carroll counties.

2016: Sanders 63 percent, Clinton 35 percent

2008: Clinton 38 percent, Obama 35 percent, John Edwards 19 percent

2004: Kerry 39 percent, Dean 27 percent, Wesley Clark 14 percent, Edwards 11 percent
The Connecticut River Valley
The Connecticut River Valley, a string of farms and college towns, is the most liberal part of the state. Sanders got his biggest margins here, Obama won even while losing statewide to Clinton, and Dean edged out Kerry. Two of those candidates were Vermonters, which helped; Sanders's first campaign events here were long weekend road trips. But the electorate is usually looking for a left-wing candidate, even when it can't find a Vermonter.
The region casts roughly 19 percent of the state's Democratic primary votes, with the biggest pile coming out of Keene, a city whose isolation and low prices have also made it a beacon for libertarians. The three counties where most valley residents live have plenty of internal differences "" Sullivan County is more rural and backed Trump over Clinton "" but tend to vote as a unit in a Democratic primary.
Center-left candidates tend to struggle here, and there are plenty of towns where Clinton, in 2016, didn't reach 25 percent of the vote. If there is a strong left-wing vote, but it splits, the map will probably show Warren performing strongly in other liberal parts of the state but Sanders dominant along the 'Conn River.'

2016: Sanders 68 percent, Clinton 30 percent

2008: Obama 42 percent, Clinton 33 percent, Edwards 16 percent

2004: Dean 38 percent, Kerry 32 percent, Clark 12 percent, Edwards 10 percent
Merrimack County
Capitol cities tend to lean left, and Concord fits the mold: It backed Clinton over Trump by 25 points in 2016, helping her win a county that casts 12 percent of the state's Democratic primary vote. More telling was Bow, an example of the suburbs where Mitt Romney ran stronger than Trump was ever able to and where Clinton had come closest to beating Sanders. (He got the win by just 61 votes.)
Although the county has been politically competitive for years, Democrats now control two-thirds of its state legislative districts, thanks to those same Trump-phobic independents and former Republicans.

2016: Sanders 58 percent, Clinton 40 percent

2008: Obama 38 percent, Clinton 36 percent, Edwards 17 percent

2004: Kerry 38 percent, Dean 27 percent, Edwards 13 percent, Clark 12 percent
Belknap County
No region has less power in a Democratic primary. Dominated locally by Republicans, it casts just 4 percent of the Democrats' primary vote and gets relatively few visits. It's distinct enough from nearby Merrimack County to resist being lumped in, with fewer votes, but it's a good place to watch for turnout patterns: No Democrat, not even the three who have won elections in a neighboring state, has an advantage here.

2016: Sanders 61 percent, Clinton 36 percent

2008: Clinton 37 percent, Obama 37 percent, Edwards 19 percent

2004: Kerry 38 percent, Dean 25 percent, Edwards 13 percent, Clark 13 percent
Strafford County
Connecting the seacoast area to the lake country, Strafford casts 10 percent of the primary vote, and half of that comes from three towns: Dover, Rochester and Durham. The latter town includes the University of New Hampshire, which is enough to give it a big bloc of liberal voters but not enough to dominate the county. (It's the state's biggest university, and it enrolls less than half as many students as Iowa State University.)
The strong Democratic lean of the county can mean very different things with different primary lineups. In 2004 and 2008, Kerry and Clinton ran well ahead of their statewide numbers here, as active Democrats moved over to the candidates they knew best. But in 2016, Sanders blew Clinton away. A key city was swingy Rochester, which broke heavily for Clinton in 2008, then gave Sanders a 21-point landslide. Like Belknap, Strafford is a good place to monitor how much of the 2016 vote was an endorsement of Sanders's policies and how much was an anti-Clinton message vote that will be hard to replicate in 2020.

2016: Sanders 63 percent, Clinton 35 percent

2008: Clinton 41 percent, Obama 34 percent, Edwards 18 percent

2004: Kerry 40 percent, Dean 24 percent, Edwards 13 percent, Clark 13 percent
Rockingham County
The biggest Republican margins come from some of these towns, which are close to Boston and easy places to escape high-tax Massachusetts. Democrats dominate the seacoast towns like Rye and Portsmouth, while Republicans win in suburban cities like Derry. What they often have in common is money, with a median income of about $90,000, the highest in the state, doubling the average income in rural Coos County.
A full 22 percent of New Hampshire's Democratic voters live in a county that gets most of its news from Boston, and plenty of its residents, too; former senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts moved to Rye before making an unsuccessful 2014 run for one his new state's Senate seats.
This electorate stands out because it's not been particularly interested in insurgent candidates or underdogs. Clinton ran strongest here, in both of her presidential bids, and ran further ahead on the seacoast. (It was in Portsmouth, shortly before the 2008 primary, where she teared up at a question about how hard campaigning was, a show of emotion that helped her win.)

2016: Sanders 57 percent, Clinton 42 percent

2008: Clinton 42 percent, Obama 35 percent, Edwards 17 percent

2004: Kerry 41 percent, Dean 23 percent, Clark 12 percent, Edwards 12 percent
Hillsborough County
The state's most populous county casts 27 percent of the Democratic primary vote; together, the Boston suburbs of the 'southern tier' contain about half of all New Hampshire voters. Hillsborough has moved to Rockingham's left, though, with Democrats pushing the GOP aside in cities such as Manchester and Nashua. Just five years ago, Republicans sat in the mayor's office of both cities. Democrats now run both, with Republicans failing even to find a candidate in this year's Nashua elections. In the primary, the electorate is much more centrist, rejecting left-wing candidates by the same big margins as Rockingham County. But there are far too many votes for any candidate to write it off.
Back in 2016, even though Sanders did worse in Hillsborough than in other parts of New Hampshire, he united every sort of anti-Clinton voter. She won just one big town, Bedford, and lost others by slightly smaller margins than her statewide numbers. Sanders pulverized her in the smallest towns and took Manchester by the same margin Clinton once won it by over Obama.

2016: Sanders 57 percent, Clinton 41 percent

2008: Clinton 42 percent, Obama 35 percent, Edwards 16 percent

2004: Kerry 40 percent, Dean 22 percent, Edwards 13 percent, Clark 12 percent
The big picture
After all of that, after eking out every vote from Salem to Pittsburg, New Hampshire offers momentum more than anything else. It'll send just 24 pledged delegates to the Democratic National Convention, the least of any of the early-voting states. 
But the state is brutally effective at shrinking the field. In this century, no more than five Democrats have escaped Iowa with viable campaigns, and no more than three have gotten out of New Hampshire.
No Democrat from a neighboring state (Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont) has ever lost New Hampshire and gone on to take the nomination; even a weaker-than-expected win, like Ed Muskie's in 1972 or Paul Tsongas's 20 years later, can start the clock running out for a local candidate.

When he organized the first retreat of the Blue Dog Coalition in 1995, then-Rep. John Tanner reserved 50 rooms at a resort on Maryland's Eastern Shore. 
As the event drew closer, the Tennessee Democrat learned that he had booked only 23 rooms, setting the coalition of fiscally moderate House Democrats off to a potentially very rocky start.
On Friday, though, the Blue Dogs celebrated their 25th birthday, a quarter-century run of bonding over what it is like to represent the most conservative terrain inside the House Democratic caucus. Their ranks have ebbed and flowed over the years, a movement that could usually be seen as tracking whether the Democrats were holding the majority.
If their weekly meetings had several dozen lawmakers, that meant things were going well for House Democrats. When attendance dropped into the low teens, as it did five years ago, that meant Democrats were out in the political wilderness searching for a path to relevance. 
Now flush with 25 members "" including nine freshmen, eight of whom flipped GOP districts in 2018 "" this coalition feels as if it is once again thriving. They look a lot younger and more diverse than the original 23 members, with a geographic focus that is shifting into the suburban districts that were once Republican strongholds. 
'While the makeup and size of our coalition has changed over the years, our focus on fiscal responsibility and a strong national security has never wavered,' Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.), the current co-chairman of the Blue Dogs, said in a House floor speech last week. 
Their focus on fiscal matters, however, comes at a fairly stark moment in national politics. After spending the Obama White House years howling about the federal debt, Republicans have largely abandoned fiscal restraint both in terms of tax and spending policies, with the debt soaring by more than $3 trillion in President Trump's three years in office. 
Democrats running for president often critique Trump and Republicans for rank hypocrisy on the issue, but none has any real plan to tackle the debt. In fact, while they all generally would push to repeal the 2017 tax cuts, those presidential candidates then would use those funds on expansive federal programs, such as the Medicare-for-all proposal touted by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). 
This makes the Blue Dogs, while strong again in numbers and clout, feel almost as isolated now on a key policy as they were when Tanner madly scrambled to find staff and strategists to attend their first retreat. 
'Most importantly, Blue Dogs remain focused on our founding principles of fiscal responsibility,' said Murphy, who has endorsed former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg in the 2020 race. 
Clearly the coalition is quite concerned that Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist, at the top of the ticket would put many of their seats in peril. So far, among those who have endorsed, the Blue Dogs heavily favor Bloomberg and former vice president Joe Biden. 
After the 1994 elections swept Republicans into the House majority for the first time in 40 years, making huge gains in defeating rural Democrats, some of those remaining felt as if they needed a new home. 
Tanner, who retired in 2010, put together a group of more than 20 Democrats who survived the previous election and wanted to find some middle ground, particularly after Republicans successfully lampooned the Clinton administration's health-care proposal as big government. 
They were even willing to work with Republicans on their proposals to balance the annual federal budget. 
'If you don't get control of your budget, whether you're a nation, a country, a business, or a family, you lose control of your destiny. This is a great disservice to future generations who can't vote and make decisions. So I thought we needed to work toward balance,' then-Rep. Glen Browder (D-Ala.) told a biographer, transcripts of which were included in a detailed Medium post that is a retrospective on the coalition.
About two-thirds of the original group hailed from the South, and only two were women. 
Founded on Feb. 14, 1995, they chose the name after a painting of a blue dog with yellow eyes hanging in the offices of Rep. W.J. 'Billy' Tauzin, then a Democrat from Louisiana who hosted their early meetings. 
What that group did not realize was that it would be another 12 years before Democrats regained the majority. By that point, Tauzin, after switching parties later in 1995, had finished up a three-year run as Republican chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. 
A few other original Blue Dogs also switched parties, and it was not until the 2006 midterm elections "" when Democrats successfully recruited a crop of candidates who appealed to those rural and exurban regions "" that both the coalition and the broader caucus swept back into power, allowing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to make history as the first woman ever to wield that chamber's gavel. 
By 2010, their numbers soared to 54, but the group was set up for another big fall, getting wiped out in those midterms and seeing their ranks dropped to a fraction of that record high. 
By 2015, just 15 House Democrats joined the coalition, a low mark that left the Blue Dogs without any real bark or bite. 
 But in 2016, following a shooting massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Murphy jumped into a House race in Florida. 
Rescued by the U.S. Navy as an infant Vietnamese boat refugee, Murphy, 41, defeated a 24-year incumbent and then easily won reelection in 2018, providing the portrait for the new era of Blue Dogs: younger, more diverse, socially liberal while still fiscally conservative. 
There are five women among the Blue Dogs, including four who won GOP districts in 2018. 
As he gathered current staff and Blue Dog alumni to celebrate last Thursday, Tanner told the secret of how he made the annual retreat a success: no policy or issue agenda items, just socializing.

The White House's newest budget plan revealed the pressure President Trump faces to curb spending while protecting popular programs, constrained by his decision to significantly increase defense spending and largely wall off money for Medicare and Social Security.
At the same time, Democratic presidential candidates are far from united on an alternative to Trump's plan. They are battling over competing visions for how to use the federal budget to expand the economy and lift American families.
Trump's budget proposal, released Monday, would allocate a record $4.8-trillion in spending for the fiscal year that begins in October, and White House officials said it would result in a $966-billion deficit because tax revenue continues to lag. But the deficit will probably be even higher than that, in part because Congress is expected to reject the White House's call for major cuts to housing, education, environmental protection, foreign aid and other programs. 
Although Democrats have not unified around an alternative budget, many of them have seized on the broad range of cuts Trump is pursuing nine months before the presidential election.
'The president of the United States thinks we're suckers,' Pete Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Ind., said Monday. 'We know, we know, there will be accountability for all those broken promises.'
One of the biggest reductions in the Trump budget would affect Medicaid, a health program for low-income Americans, which Trump seeks to cut by $920-billion over 10-years. It was one of several social-safety-net programs the White House targeted for cuts, and one the Obama administration fought to expand.
Even with the proposed cuts, Trump's decision to wall off Social Security, Medicare and the Defense Department from big reductions would keep the government's fiscal picture largely out of balance. If all the proposals were enacted by Congress and the economy grew at a much faster clip than many economists say is possible, a gap between spending and revenue would continue for the next 15 years, White House officials said. During the Obama administration, Republicans insisted that the deficit be eliminated within 10-years, but those calls have faded since Trump's inauguration.

Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have called for major spending on health-care and education programs. Former vice president Joe Biden has warned Democrats not to embrace an agenda that calls for unrealistic social policy goals, and Buttigieg declared at a town hall event in Nashua, N.H., on Sunday that it was time to get serious about the rising deficit, even though 'it's not fashionable in progressive circles to talk too much about the debt.'
The dispute comes as the 2020 campaign shapes up to be a sprawling debate about the size and scope of government for Americans of all backgrounds and income levels. Trump's budget offers Democratic candidates big targets, including major cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and domestic programs such as those involving education and environmental protection. Some Democrats, in turn, are proposing huge spending plans that Trump is likely to brand as 'socialist,' as they wrestle with multiple contradictions of their own over how best to handle government spending.
Because the GOP under Trump has largely abandoned the focus on deficit reduction that was a central theme for Republicans during the Obama administration, some Democratic candidates see a vacuum to fill. Moderate members of the party want to seize the deficit-hawk mantle "" as Buttigieg has sought to do "" while the liberal wing wants to significantly expand government programs, which they can justify in part by pointing to Republicans' abdication on the issue.
'Both parties are juggling whether to embrace their expensive priorities and build a dream government, or responsibly reduce the deficit but give up on some of their dreams,' said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank.

Despite the president's lack of public focus on the budget, the document spares cuts to politically sensitive targets Trump had sought to slash in the past. 

These include the Special Olympics and the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative "" a program important to Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, critical states in the presidential election. 




As Biden has campaigned in New Hampshire, he has argued that Trump is morally and economically unfit. On Monday, Biden tried to cite Trump's budget as an example of why the Republican is unfit for office. He contrasted Trump's efforts to cut safety-net programs, including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, with his experience on Saturday handing out food to needy families in New Hampshire.
'It's the United States of America,' Biden said. 'We're standing there handing out bread and food. Some of the little kids couldn't even pick the boxes up. . . . And this president of the United States, as I speak, is cutting SNAP, food stamps. What in God's name is happening to us?'


The leading Democratic presidential candidates have proposed between $5-trillion and $50-trillion in new federal spending, with Biden on one end of the spectrum, Sanders on the other and most of the remaining candidates in between. All the Democratic hopefuls have said their plans would be paid for with tax increases on individuals and corporations, although Sanders said his Green New Deal legislation would be paid for in part by new tax revenue created by the economic growth generated by massive federal investment.
Buttigieg's nod to reducing the deficit was denounced by many liberal economists, who pointed to historically low inflation as a reason to remain focused on spending priorities rather than deficit reduction. Stephanie Kelton, a former Sanders economist, wrote on Twitter that 'cutting the deficit should NEVER be a policy goal.'

TARRANT COUNTY, Tex. - The middle-class suburbs of Fort Worth have been a stronghold for statehouse Republicans for decades. But candidate Joe Drago says he and the other Democratic challengers in this rapidly growing county will break that streak this year. 
""We are seeing working-class people moving out of urban areas and into the suburbs, and that has changed the demographics profoundly,"" he said. ""We believe a lot of these people are Democrats.""
Sprawling housing developments filled with young, diverse families have crowded out the cattle farms and open fields in Drago's district, convincing Democratic leaders that they have a chance to flip his and 21 similar state legislative districts this November. Democrats need nine to take control of the Texas House for the first time since 2003.
The party plans to funnel tens of millions of dollars into the effort, an unprecedented push that could become one of the most consequential political battles of the year. If Democrats are successful, it would raise questions about Texas's future as a Republican bulwark in national politics. 
""Republicans really haven't come to grips with an understanding of what is happening in Texas,"" said Manny Garcia, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party. ""You have a rising, new Texas electorate.""
Minorities now make up more than half of the population in once solidly Republican Tarrant County, where Drago's district is located. Wavering support for President Trump in the suburbs has further boosted Texas Democrats' confidence, as well as blowback to conservative GOP policies on health care and education in the state.
Backed by an infusion of cash from donors nationwide, the state party plans to capitalize on the moment using tactics and organizing efforts rarely deployed in local races, including opposition research.
But many political analysts remain skeptical of Democrats' chances, and Texas Republicans say they are prepared to slow, if not stall, Democrats' suburban gains, which included picking up 14 state legislative seats in 2018. 
GOP strategists' confidence was boosted in January when the party won a special election for a Texas House seat in suburban Houston. Former presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke and a host of other prominent Democrats campaigned heavily to flip the seat in Fort Bend County, but the GOP candidate won by 16 percentage points. 
Republicans are hoping to mount a successful defense statewide and have reenlisted the help of political strategist Karl Rove, who helped shape the GOP's rise to dominance in Texas decades ago. Rove is working with consumer data to identify and register new GOP voters in Texas suburbs. 
""One lesson from the 2018 election is, some of our candidates had gotten a little overconfident,"" said James Dickey, chairman of the Texas Republican Party. ""But nobody is doing that in 2020.""
Republicans are fighting against a tide of demographic change. Since 2016, Texas has added 2 million registered voters, about half of them under age 25, and 36 percent of them Hispanic, according to Tom Bonier, executive director of TargetSmart, a Democratic data firm.
Texas Democrats say they believe there are an additional 2.3 million unregistered eligible voters, the vast majority of whom are people of color or under age 35. 

In parts of Tarrant, which includes Fort Worth and its suburbs, the population changes have turned the area into a political battleground. Tarrant County was an epicenter for tea party opposition to former president Barack Obama's policies. But Trump carried the county with just 52 percent of the vote in 2016, and O'Rourke narrowly won it in his 2018 contest against U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R). 
Now Democrats are targeting five statehouse seats there, and Republicans consider the challenge to be a defining threat to their party's effort to cling to power statewide.
""We are the last urban county in Texas that is red, as all the other large urban counties in Texas have already turned blue,"" said Jeremy Bradford, executive director of the Tarrant County GOP. ""We know we are now ground zero for these races . . . because we are kind of the last defense in keeping Texas red, and that is not something we take lightly.""

Minority voters are registering at higher rates in Tarrant County than they are in Texas and nationally. The number of Hispanic registrants there grew by 6.4 percent since November 2018, higher than the state average of 5 percent, according to a Washington Post analysis of data from L2, a nonpartisan voter data firm.
Drago's district is centered in Mansfield, a suburb where the population has grown nearly tenfold over four decades. 
In the 1960s, Mansfield was nationally known as one of the last Texas school systems to integrate as local officials defied federal court orders for years. Today, white, black and Latino children account for about 30 percent each of the student body. 
Drago said the region's increasing diversity will power his campaign as he works to drive up Democratic turnout in a district that Cruz carried by fewer than 100 votes in 2018.

Drago will be counting on voters such as Bernadette Amao, who in December bought a 4,000-square-foot house in one of Mansfield's newly built subdivisions. She checks the mail regularly to see whether her and her husband's voter registration cards have arrived. 
""I always vote, and that will be especially true this year,"" said Amao, who immigrated to Texas from Nigeria in 1997 and says Trump is too divisive. ""If local Republicans continue to support President Trump blindly, I will not be voting for any of them."" 
Polls show that Trump's popularity has been declining across suburban Texas, which Democrats say helped them pick up two congressional seats in 2018.
""From mid-2016 to now, I just keeping having more and more people come up to me and say, 'I have been voting for Republicans for years, and I just can't do it anymore,' "" said Matt Angle, founder of the Lone Star Project, a Democratic-aligned political action committee.
Angle is referring to voters such as Kathy Griffin, a 68-year-old Mansfield resident who has voted for Republicans in the past - including for Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) during his 2012 presidential campaign. By 2018, she was so disgusted with Trump she planted a sign for O'Rourke, then the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, in her yard.
""I hope we run [Trump] out of town on a rail, tarred and feathered,"" said Griffin, a retired schoolteacher. ""He's a liar . . . so for me, it will be Democratic up and down the ballot.""
Republican leaders say they are confident that Trump won't be as toxic for the party in the suburbs as he was two years ago, particularly if Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a democratic socialist, is the Democrats' presidential nominee.

""Now, there is a choice on the ballot, and it's not just Trump versus nobody or just a question about whether, 'Do you like Trump?' "" said Chris Murphy, an Austin-based GOP strategist. 
The healthy economy achieved under Republican leaders will boost their chances of maintaining control, Republicans say. Drago's Republican opponent, Mansfield Mayor David Cook, predicts that voters - even the diverse newcomers to his district - will reward Gov. Greg Abbott and other Republicans for the state's 3.5 percent unemployment rate, which is near a record low. 
""Texas is still a Republican-leaning state,"" Cook said. ""And the people who are moving to Texas do so for a reason - the economy is great in the U.S., and it's even better in Texas."" 







But when it comes to other local issues, Drago and other Democratic candidates say the political dynamics are on their side, including Republicans' refusal to expand Medicaid and increase funding for public schools.
In Mansfield, for example, parents have been complaining that school overcrowding has forced some students to be bused to other locations.
""Our state constitution charges us with providing a good, strong public education, and there is a tendency on the Republican side to not put an emphasis on public education,"" Drago said. 
In response to the GOP losses in 2018, Abbott and Republican lawmakers pushed through an $11.6 billion plan to boost funding for public schools. 
""On public education, the state is moving in the right direction,"" Cook said. 
One issue in Tarrant County expected to remain especially divisive is gun control. 
Last year, after a shooting at an El Paso Walmart killed 22 people, some Republicans worried their policies were at odds with suburban residents who were clamoring for more restrictions on firearms. But GOP leaders say the political consequences of the gun debate shifted in December when armed security guards at a Fort Worth church shot and killed a gunman who opened fire during Sunday services. 
""You have had absolutely tragic events that have happened with guns, but there have also been equally tragic events that have been prevented by guns, too,"" said Bradford, of the Tarrant County GOP. 
For national Democrats, however, the party's success last year in flipping both houses of Virginia's legislature serves as a model for what they think is possible in Texas. 
Jessica Post, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), noted that Texas and Virginia both allow unlimited campaign contributions to legislative campaigns. Those laws will enable the DLCC to partner with labor unions and other left-leaning groups to spend heavily on Texas races.
""I think we will see even larger levels of spending in Texas than we saw in Virginia,"" Post said.
Still, Cal Jillson, a professor of political science at Southern Methodist University, remains skeptical that Democrats will have the resources to turn out a lot of nontraditional voters. 
""The Democratic institution in Texas has been so weak for so long that even if they knew where every one of those people were, they would not be able to create the volunteer force needed to get there on the doorstep to register and turn them out,"" Jillson said. 
But here in Tarrant County, Democratic House candidate Lydia Bean remains convinced she can pair big money with grass-roots campaigning to help flip Tarrant County. 
Bean's mother ran for the statehouse seat two years ago and received 46 percent of the vote after spending just $30,000. Bean, who runs a nonprofit organization, plans to raise nearly 20 times that amount this year. 
As she canvassed for votes near Six Flags Amusement Park, Bean walked with a digital device identifying names and addresses of potential voters. At the home of one Latino couple, Bean discovered that the wife was not registered to vote. 
""What do you think about Trump?"" Bean asked the couple. 
""I think he is doing a good job, and the economy is good,"" said Gus Medina, surprising Bean. 
Despite that letdown, Bean still considered her visit to be a success. 
""I think he's persuadable, and now we know his wife is not even registered,"" said Bean, who will be back at Medina's door before November.

Democratic candidates delve into conflict abroad, gender and health care in last faceoff before caucuses

DES MOINES "" A whittled-down field of Democratic presidential candidates on Tuesday focused on their shared disdain for President Trump and elaborated on a host of policy differences domestic and foreign in an Iowa presidential debate whose most animated moment turned on whether a woman could become president.
With the Democratic voting beginning in less than three weeks "" and knotted among a quartet of leading contenders "" the candidates differed over the suddenly topical decision of whether to commit troops abroad or remove them from the Middle East, their disparate views on trade deals and their starkly different proposals to remake the country's health-care industry.
Coming on the heels of President Trump's decision to kill Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the debate opened up with a relitigation of the war in Iraq, and a renewed discussion over how and whether the candidates would commit troops in the Middle East. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) committed to bringing combat troops home, while former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg pointed to his own experience in the military. Former vice president Joe Biden cast his experience in that office as invaluable, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) suggested Biden's vote in favor of the Iraq War was disqualifying.
'Joe and I listened to what Dick Cheney and George Bush and [Donald] Rumsfeld had to say,' Sanders said, speaking of the debate after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to give Bush authority to strike overseas. 'I thought they were lying. I didn't believe them for a moment. I took to the floor. I did everything I-could to prevent that war. Joe saw it differently.'
Biden, while focusing on the work he did during the Obama administration to wind down U.S. military involvement in Iraq, did not defend the vote. 
'It was a mistake to trust that they weren't going to go to war,' Biden said about the Bush administration's assurances in 2002. 'They said they were not going to go to war.'

The candidates agreed on the need to reduce the U.S. military footprint in Iraq and Afghanistan, though they differed slightly on timetables and other details. 
'No one has a solution and an endpoint. We need to get our combat troops out,' Warren said. 'They are not helping.' 
Biden and others struck a more nuanced note, arguing that Special Operations forces should remain in the region to guard against a resurgence of the Islamic State and to protect U.S. interests.
The former vice president also said he would not meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, with whom Trump met to-much-orchestrated drama but-with whom he has been unable to strike a deal on nuclear weapons. 
'No. Not now. I wouldn't meet with him without preconditions,' he said, blaming Trump for giving the North Korean legitimacy by meeting with him. 
He also noted that the leader had called him 'a rabid dog who should be beaten to death with a stick.'
'Other than that, you like him,' Sanders joked.
Gender politics, which subsumed the campaign in recent days, provided one of the sharpest exchanges of the night as Warren and Sanders clashed over whether Sanders said in a private 2018 meeting that a woman could not be elected against Trump in 2020.
Sanders denied the claim outright. 'Does anybody in their right mind believe that a woman can't be president?' Sanders said. 'I don't think anybody believes that.'
But Warren, as part of an apparent pivot to embrace her role as the highest-polling woman in the race, stuck to the claim she first made the day before the debate. 
'I disagreed,' she said of her conversation with Sanders in 2018. 'Bernie is my friend, and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie. But look, this question about whether or not a woman can be president has been raised and it's time for us to attack it head-on.'
She went on to divide the stage by gender, saying that she and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) were the only two candidates to have won all of their elections, while the men onstage had collectively lost 10 races. 
Klobuchar laughingly agreed, and later noted that she had an unbroken record of winning in areas similar to those in which Trump had defeated Hillary Clinton.
As the debate ended, Warren could be seen approaching Sanders but declining his offer of a handshake. They both appeared to be testy, Warren wringing her hands and Sanders making frequent gestures. 
The extended confrontation was remarkable, coming four years after the party selected Clinton as its first female nominee. Her loss to President Trump amid what many felt were misogynistic attacks helped energize women who came out for massive marches the day after he was inaugurated, helped fuel the election of record numbers of women to Congress and handed the House speaker's gavel back to Nancy Pelosi.
But Democratic anxiety over Trump, and whether he could defeat another woman, has been one of the looming questions over the primary contest for the-past year, asked everywhere from top party leaders to Democrats attending rallies in early states. 
Biden chimed into the discussion to argue that he alone had the longevity and the experience to knit together a coalition of the whole party. 
'I agree women can win,' Biden said, touting the number of female candidates he helped in 2018 and calling it 'the best group I've ever campaigned for in terms of competence.'
'But the real issue is who can bring the whole party together, represents all elements of the party,' he said. 'I would argue that in terms of endorsements around the country, endorsements, wherever we go, I am the one who has the broadest coalition of anyone running up here in this race.'
The debate came just 20 days before the Iowa caucuses, the results of which are likely to be pivotal in the 2020 nomination fight. 
The major Democratic candidates have gone all-in on the state, and with polls showing a multicandidate tie, with about 1-in 5 voters favoring Biden, Sanders and Buttigieg. Warren is close on their heels with 16-percent support, according to an average of two Iowa polls over the past week. 
The two other candidates on the stage, Klobuchar and the billionaire activist Tom Steyer, have been ranking in the single digits, well below the 15 percent threshold required by party rules-to acquire convention delegates. 
Steyer, who has gained ground in several new polls after a barrage of television ads, made one of his most aggressive arguments around the need to combat climate change. 
'We're going to come to the rescue of Americans who are in-trouble. But this is why climate is my number one priority,' he said. 'And I'm still shocked that I'm the only person on this stage who will say this: I would declare a state of emergency on day one.'
For several of the candidates onstage, the debate marked the final highlighted moment before the Senate impeachment trial diverts the nation's attention and demands their presence in Washington. While Warren, Sanders and Klobuchar will have to serve as jurors, Biden too 
could be roped into the proceedings; some Senate Republicans are seeking to force his son Hunter to testify about his activities in Ukraine when his father was vice president.
Biden said Tuesday night that he had no concern about his family being dragged into the Senate trial. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of either Biden, but it has been a topic the campaign has generally tried to avoid.
'It doesn't really matter whether he goes after me,' Biden said. 'I have got to be able not-only to fight but also to heal, and as president of the United States that's what I will attempt to do.'
Some of the debate reprised earlier such gatherings. For the seventh straight faceoff, the candidates cast different visions on health care, with Sanders continuing to push for Medicare-for-all, which would abolish the private health-care industry. 
'Again, I think it is much better to build on the Affordable Care Act,' Klobuchar said. 'And if you want to be practical and progressive at the same time and have a plan and not a pipe dream, you have to show how are you going to pay for it.'
Several of the candidates tried to address some of their shortcomings. 
Buttigieg responded to concerns in the party, shown in a recent Washington Post poll, that black voters do not support his campaign, even after they learn more about him.
'The black voters who know me best are supporting me,' Buttigieg said, before listing off several recent endorsements. 'The biggest mistake we can make is to take black votes for granted. And I never will.'
In the opening minutes of the debate, Sanders also tried to address the concerns that he is too divisive and wouldn't have enough appeal to a general electorate. 

'I am able to work with Republicans,' he said, citing unsuccessful legislation he co-sponsored with Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). 'I am able to bring people together to try to create a world where we solve conflicts over the negotiating table, not through military efforts.'
