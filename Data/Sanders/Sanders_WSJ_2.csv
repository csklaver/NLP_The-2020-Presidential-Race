WASHINGTON—The increasingly strict public-health measures designed to slow the spread of coronavirus are raising concerns about the feasibility of holding the remaining Democratic presidential primary contests, as well as the logistics of holding a November general election if the pandemic is still under way.
The nation's election system is a complicated thicket of state and federal laws. The process of selecting a presidential nominee is further complicated by the fact that political parties are private organizations and can set their own internal rules.
Depending on the jurisdiction, state officials and party leaders do have some flexibility in altering the dates and possibly the formats of the remaining presidential primary contests in response to the growing pandemic, election-law experts say. Five states have already done so—including Ohio,
where there was a brief struggle between the governor and the state supreme court
before the voting was postponed—and more may follow.
If the pandemic persists into the fall, as some public-health officials fear it could, Congress would need to step into the picture to make any significant alterations to the general election date. That date was fixed as the first Tuesday after Nov. 1 by an act of Congress in 1845 and cannot be changed—not by the president, not by state election officials—absent new legislation.
Courts have granted such strong protections to the rights of citizens to cast a ballot that even the orders of public-health officials, who have sweeping emergency authorities at all levels of government to limit gatherings or impose quarantines, could be trumped.
""While I think that states would have the authority to take reasonable measures to ensure public safety, ultimately they would have to yield to the right to vote,"" said Marc Elias, a Democratic election lawyer who has worked on numerous presidential campaigns.
The Democratic primary contest has already been affected by the virus. On Tuesday, Joe Biden defeated Bernie Sanders in
a trio of states
, but election-day turnout levels appeared to be low compared with similar contests held in the past, The Wall Street Journal reported, with
many voters venturing out of their homes for the first time in days
to cast ballots.
The pandemic may abate in coming weeks as it has in Asia, where life is slowly returning to normal in early outbreak sites like China. But if it doesn't diminish, or returns in the fall, election officials have already expressed concern about how they might hold a general election in the middle of a deadly virus outbreak—and whether an extremely low-turnout election would be seen as legitimate by the voters.
The logistics of holding in-person elections raise additional concerns. Some of the most reliable voters are elderly, a group most at risk for coronavirus complications. In addition, many of the poll workers and volunteers who staff elections across the country are older. The Election Assistance Commission found that 58% of all poll workers in 2018 were over the age of 60.

.
One proposal is for Congress to mandate that states expand vote-by-mail programs to all voters, limiting the need for in-person ballot-casting. Sens. Ron Wyden (D, Ore.) and Amy Klobuchar (D, Minn.) have proposed such a bill, which also would provide $500 million in grants to states for prepaid postage and equipment upgrades.
""Virtually every state already today has an absentee ballot arrangement. What Sen. Klobuchar and I are doing is making available a significant amount of federal funds for states to move to ensure that this fall in the middle of the pandemic, American voters are not going to be forced to choose between their health and voting,"" said Mr. Wyden on MSNBC this week.
There is ample precedent for such an action. Congress has previously mandated that all states allow military voters to cast absentee ballots by mail and that states allow voters to register while renewing or obtaining driver's licenses, for example. Thirty-four states plus Washington, D.C., allow any voter to cast a mail-in ballot for any reason; 16 place restrictions on reasons for requesting mail-in ballots.
Vote by mail is controversial, though. Some liberal activists believe that it dampens turnout among key demographic groups, and they have concerns about programs that don't include paid postage. Some conservatives have additional concerns about fraud with mail-in ballots, or simply support a single, nationwide election day.
Even opponents of universal vote-by-mail say that this year might be an exception and that it is particularly important for the 2020 balloting to be run in an orderly and legitimate way.
""Personally, I think extensive voting by mail is not a good idea. I'd hate to see using this crisis to sneak in permanent voting by mail,"" said Bradley Smith, a former Republican appointee to the Federal Election Commission who now teaches at Capital University Law School.
But for the 2020 election? ""I think it would probably be good in the current circumstances for Congress to pass limited legislation providing for some kind of vote-by-mail,"" he said.

WASHINGTON—U.S. officials have informed Sen. Bernie Sanders that Russia is actively trying to support his campaign for the Democratic nomination as part of Moscow's broader efforts to interfere in the 2020 election, according to two people familiar with the matter.
President Trump and a small number of lawmakers have been briefed on the same intelligence, the people said.
The classified FBI briefing wasn't of the type routinely given to presidential campaigns about election security, those people said. It was given in reaction to intelligence considered compelling enough that Mr. Sanders needed to be alerted, one of the people said. But the intelligence suggested that the Russian effort to bolster Mr. Sanders hasn't approached the scale or scope of operations to support
Mr. Trump's campaign in 2016
, the person said.
The Washington Post earlier reported Mr. Sanders received a briefing that Russia was seeking to support him in the primary.
Speaking to reporters Friday, Mr. Sanders acknowledged a briefing had taken place but said it wasn't clear what role Russia was attempting to play in the election.
""We were told that Russia and maybe other countries were getting involved in the campaign,"" Mr. Sanders told reporters in Bakersfield, Calif. ""And look, here is the message to Russia, 'Stay out of the American election.' ""
Mr. Sanders, who has been criticized for online vitriol some of his supporters have directed against his opponents, also said in a statement that it was possible ""ugly stuff"" that has been attributed to his campaign was actually coming from fake internet accounts.
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security declined to comment.
The reports emerged a month after the briefing on the day before
the Nevada caucuses
. Mr. Sanders is currently leading his Democratic rivals
in national polls
following a first-place finish in the New Hampshire primary this month, and polls suggested he was positioned for a strong finish in Nevada.
""I'll let you guess, about one day before the Nevada caucuses, why do you think it came out?"" Mr. Sanders asked.
Last week, intelligence officials told President Trump and lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee about Russia's apparent preference to have Mr. Trump re-elected, according to people familiar with the matter. During an Oval Office meeting Mr. Trump
lashed out
at Joseph Maguire, his acting director of national intelligence until he was replaced this week, because he was irate that lawmakers received the information first, the people said. The president was also agitated by the content of the intelligence that indicated Russia would again seek to support his electoral prospects in the fall, they said.
It couldn't be determined what Moscow's precise motive was in its effort to support Mr. Sanders, including through social media, the people familiar with the matter said.
Russia has repeatedly denied interfering in U.S. elections.
Mr. Trump, at a campaign rally in Las Vegas on Friday, dismissed reports that U.S. intelligence agencies believe Russia may interfere this year on his behalf, calling them ""disinformation."" He said Russian President Vladimir Putin would want to wait until Democrats pick their nominee.
""Wouldn't he rather have Bernie, who honeymooned in Moscow?"" Mr. Trump asked.
The president's remarks about Mr. Sanders emerged before any reports that the Democratic candidate had been warned about Moscow's interest in aiding his campaign, a sequence pointed to by the Sanders campaign.
Mr. Sanders and his wife traveled to Russia in 1988 on a delegation from Burlington, Vt., where he was mayor, to establish a sister-city program with the city of Yaroslavl. They also celebrated their honeymoon there.
U.S. intelligence officials have been warning for years that Russia and others will likely seek to interfere in the 2020 contest. Former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation found that Russia interfered in
""sweeping and systematic"" fashion
in the 2016 presidential election to help Mr. Trump and denigrate his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton.
But Mr. Mueller's probe also found that Russian intelligence operatives spreading propaganda on social media also showed some favoritism for Mr. Sanders.
""Use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest except for Sanders and Trump—we support them,"" a Russian operative is quoting as saying in an indictment.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of Mr. Sanders's rivals for the Democratic nomination, told reporters Friday she hadn't received a similar briefing.
""I believe that we need as much transparency as possible on any Russian interference,"" she said. ""Understand, this is about disinformation and the way to fight disinformation is to call it out, show what it is, and give everyone full information as quickly as possible. Otherwise, the Russians continue to have too much influence over our campaign, and this is how we fight against that.""
U.S. national security officials have struggled with how to respond to indications that foreign adversaries may be meddling in elections after the Obama administration was criticized by Republicans and Democrats alike for not disclosing more to the public and Russia's interference in 2016.
In November the Trump administration
outlined its plan
for when to notify the public or campaigns of foreign election interference, but the framework received criticism from some election officials who said it was vague and Democrats who argued it could allow for political influence.
Those notification decisions are made to further national-security interests and are ""intended to protect the integrity of political and social discourse,"" according to a one-page public summary of the framework.

The coronavirus pandemic is jolting the political debate over health care in the 2020 election campaign, with Democrats arguing the crisis shows the damage the Trump administration has done to the health-care safety net and the need for a larger federal role in providing coverage.
Health care was already a top issue for voters before the virus began spreading in the U.S. Now, with cases across 46 states and Washington, D.C., coronavirus is providing a platform for Democrats to highlight high medical costs and a lack of coverage, which they say their policy proposals would fix. Democratic presidential candidates are expected to criticize President Trump's response to the virus at Sunday night's debate.
Trump administration officials counter that they have expanded access to more affordable health-care plans. The Trump re-election campaign has sought to criticize some of the most polarizing aspects of the Democratic rivals' health plans, such as coverage for undocumented immigrants. ""Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden are two sides of the same extreme coin,"" the Trump re-election campaign tweeted on March 6. ""They both support making American families and workers pay for health care for illegal aliens.""
Democrats argue that the Trump administration's changes to the Affordable Care Act have weakened coverage for millions of Americans, and could leave people who need treatment for coronavirus with high health-care bills. They point to the expansion of health plans that can deny coverage and don't have to cover all of the ACA's minimum benefits, as well as an administration plan to back states that want to change Medicaid's open-ended federal funding into a more limited block grant that Democrats say would hurt enrollment.
Republicans have praised the administration's response and actions they say the White House has taken to make health coverage more affordable. They have accused Democrats of using coronavirus to score political points.
Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.), who is set to be Mr. Trump's chief of staff, in a Feb. 25 tweet said that ""the left wants to control: your health care.""
References to the coronavirus have recently started to appear in political advertising, as groups aligned with Democrats try to leverage the topic.
A TV ad that mentions the virus and is critical of Republican Sen. Steve Daines first appeared in Montana on Thursday, data from ad-tracking firm Kantar/CMAG shows. The spot is sponsored by Protect Our Care, a group that supports the Affordable Care Act.
""Too many Montana families go to sleep at night worried about health care, coverage, costs and now the fear of coronavirus,"" says the ad, which had run 29 times in Billings and Missoula through Thursday.
""It's absolutely going to be a topic,"" said Ken Goldstein, a University of San Francisco political-science professor who has studied campaign advertising for decades. ""The question for campaigns and strategists and ad makers is how you make it a topic and when you make it a topic.""
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How might a Democratic health-care plan benefit Americans during a health crisis? Join the conversation below.
At a time when Americans have many concerns related to the outbreak on their minds, he said, running political ads now on the outbreak has advantages and disadvantages.
""It may not be the best time to inject political messages,"" Mr. Goldstein said. ""On the other hand, people are going to be watching a lot of television and be on the internet and seeing ads. We are about to see record internet usage, video usage and TV ratings.""
Democratic presidential candidates are on the offensive on the campaign trail. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a proponent of Medicare for All, said at a March 9 rally that the coronavirus outbreak shows the ""insanity"" of a system where people can't afford to see a doctor.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, who has pushed his own plan that would expand the ACA and add an option for people to buy into a federal health plan, blamed Mr. Trump for taking steps to weaken the U.S. health system.
""Protecting the health and safety of the American people is the most important job of any president—and unfortunately, this virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration,"" Mr. Biden said Thursday. ""Our government's ability to respond effectively has been undermined by the hollowing-out of our agencies and the disparagement of science. ""
Billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was among the first to use the virus in TV ads as part of a political campaign. He ran two different spots on the topic, including one that was three minutes long, before he dropped out of the Democratic presidential primary.
Support for the ACA grew to 55% of Americans in February, the highest since the law was enacted 10 years ago, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The support is also up from 51% in October, before coronavirus cases emerged in the U.S.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ran digital ads critical of Trump officials who initially declined to ensure that any vaccine would be affordable. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California criticized the ads as playing politics with coronavirus.
The criticisms tap into a growing public angst about the virus and the administration's response.
""People see Trump making it easier for them to get coronavirus and then harder for them to get health care,"" said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist. ""That seems like a challenging agenda to sell to voters.""
According to a Quinnipiac University poll released on March 9, 49% of voters disapprove of the way Mr. Trump is handling the coronavirus response, while 43% approve,
There are sharp divides along political parties, similar to the president's overall job approval rating: 87% of Republicans approve, 83% of Democrats disapprove, and 50% of independents disapprove.

Bernie Sanders's early strength is putting him on track to scoop up delegates on Super Tuesday. PHOTO: Victor J. Blue for The Wall Street Journal
Joe Biden is betting on a victory in South Carolina to revitalize his campaign. Amy Klobuchar says she still has momentum from New Hampshire. Elizabeth Warren believes her recent debate performances gave her a fresh boost.
Pete Buttigieg is second in the delegate hunt and wants to make it a two-person race. And Michael Bloomberg is about to be on the ballot in a series of states where he has spent more than $100 million in advertising.
Democratic presidential candidates all have different reasons for staying in the 2020 race, but they are bound by a common goal: to stop Bernie Sanders from amassing a majority of delegates.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Why do you think so many Democrats remain in the race? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Sanders's
early strength
—and the more centrist rivals splitting up the vote that doesn't go his way—is putting the Vermont senator on track to scoop up delegates when voters across 14 states, one U.S. territory and party members living abroad head to the polls on March 3, known as Super Tuesday.
Mr. Sanders's rise has fueled concerns within the establishment and among party moderates that his identity as a democratic socialist and liberal policy agenda will doom Democrats in the general election. Mr. Sanders says he can beat President Trump, and
a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll
shows him winning a hypothetical matchup between them.
Only a small percentage of delegates have been awarded so far, and if his trajectory changes, another candidate could overtake him. But if he maintains his lead, they are all hoping to keep him from picking up the 1,991 delegates needed to secure the nomination outright, prompting a contested summer convention in Milwaukee from which another candidate could emerge on top.
Tuesday's contests represent a coming test that could determine whether Mr. Sanders can cruise to a commanding delegate lead. California and Texas, the two biggest delegate prizes, offer a combined 643 delegates, or nearly half of the delegates awarded on Tuesday. Mr. Sanders is leading in California, polls show, and at or near the top in Texas. If only one other candidate crosses the 15% threshold necessary to earn delegates, that could give Mr. Sanders a much easier path than if multiple people win delegates in the two states. 





Sen. Elizabeth Warren addresses the crowd at a rally in Greenville, S.C., on Friday. PHOTO: Victor J. Blue for The Wall Street Journal
""The key to winning is to minimize Sanders's margins on Super Tuesday and rack up delegates in the following contests as the field winnows,"" Mr. Buttigieg's campaign said in a memo released this week.
Mr. Sanders's coming schedule shows how he is trying to thwart his would-be challengers.
The senator was set to hold rallies Friday and Saturday in Massachusetts, Ms. Warren's home state. On Monday, Mr. Sanders will be in Ms. Klobuchar's home state of Minnesota before returning home to Vermont. All three have March 3 primaries.
""He's flexing, and I think he has every reason to,"" said Ian Sams, who worked on the presidential campaigns of Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton. ""He wants to really put Elizabeth and Amy in the corner and say, 'You can't even win your home state and I can. Why are you still pressing on in this race?'""
Ms. Klobuchar—who came in a better-than-expected third place in New Hampshire and has campaigned as the ""practical"" choice—has scheduled a Super Tuesday night party in St. Paul, Minn., and has also been competing in states such as Colorado, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.
Aides to Ms. Warren believe her fiery performance in the Feb. 19 debate in Las Vegas improved her standing in the race, and they have touted a fundraising haul of more than $21 million this month, as of Feb. 22.
Ms. Warren also received a giant lift from a political-action committee supporting her campaign, known as Persist PAC, which announced a $9 million television and digital ad buy late Thursday. The ads will run in nine media markets across three Super Tuesday states: California, Massachusetts and Texas.
Seeking a comeback, Mr. Biden is banking on South Carolina to help give him momentum. Aides believe his strength with African-American voters, who make up more than half of the Democratic primary electorate in South Carolina, could help him win delegates in a group of Southern states voting in March.
""While some people in Super Tuesday states have already voted, many voters are still making up their minds and waiting to cast their ballot until election day. South Carolina could be an important marker in what happens,"" said Becca Siegel, the Biden campaign's chief analytics officer.

What a Bernie Sanders Presidency Would Mean for Business
(Feb. 5, 2020)
Mr. Biden received a boost this week when he was
endorsed by Rep. James Clyburn
of South Carolina, the top-ranking African-American lawmaker in the House, and picked up the support Friday of Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, a former governor who served as Hillary Clinton's 2016 running mate.
His campaign has launched a $2.2 million broadcast and digital ad buy in eight states, an amount that is well behind many of his rivals. Mr. Bloomberg has spent more than $161 million on TV and radio advertising in the states, while billionaire businessman Tom Steyer has spent $42 million and Mr. Sanders has spent nearly $15 million, according to data from Kantar/CMAG.
Divisions over how to pick a nominee if no one secures a majority of delegates also have pitted Mr. Sanders against the rest of the field.
Mr. Sanders has stood alone in arguing that the candidate with the most votes should be at the top of the ticket—even if that individual fails to win a majority of pledged delegates. His rivals have said the nominee should be chosen at the Democratic convention in July if no candidate achieves a majority of delegates through primaries and caucuses.
""The person who wins the most delegates and the most votes should be the nominee,"" said Ari Rabin-Havt, Mr. Sanders's deputy campaign manager.
Democratic National Committee rules stipulate that the nominee must win a majority of delegates. If no one does, delegates are free to support any candidate on the second vote, and superdelegates—mostly party insiders and elected officials—can weigh in.
Speaking at a CNN town hall on Wednesday, Ms. Warren accused Mr. Sanders of reversing his position from 2016, when he argued that the nomination should not be awarded to a candidate with only a plurality of delegates.
""The way I see this is you write the rules before you know where everybody stands, and then you stick with those rules,"" Ms. Warren said.
Ms. Warren added that she was prepared to stay in the race and take the fight to the convention floor.
Mr. Bloomberg has also been laying the groundwork for a divided convention and has been quietly reaching out to party leaders and donors in a bid to corral support should the nominating contest go to a second ballot, according to people familiar with the matter.
The dynamic has drawn contrasts to Mr. Trump's insurgent campaign in 2016, which shocked the Republican establishment and similarly left a crowded field of rivals pinning their hopes on a brokered convention. That scenario never came to pass.
Terry Sullivan, a former senior adviser to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign, said a contested convention was wishful thinking for Democrats in 2020.
""They're hanging onto a thread, just like we were,"" he said. ""They're hanging onto a hope or a prayer that if this goes a contested convention, they can be the guy or the gal that people turn to.""
""But at the end of the day, this is Bernie's to lose,"" he added.

For many voters going to the polls Tuesday in three states, the trip was their first time out of their homes since they started practicing social distancing to deal with
the coronavirus pandemic
.
Some were successful in casting their ballots—with hand sanitizer at the ready, while others had trouble even locating an operating polling site.
Mike Kontos, a 37-year-old real-estate agent who cast his ballot at a fire station in Miami, voted for former Vice President Joe Biden with gloves and disinfectant wipes he brought with him after being cooped up at home for several days. He said Mr. Biden could be boosted by the Trump administration's handling of the coronavirus outbreak.
""If he plays it right, he could have a good chance,"" Mr. Kontos said, as voters trickled into the polling site with no lines.
While at least five states
have postponed their primaries
because of the pandemic, voters in Florida, Illinois and Arizona headed to the polls Tuesday, with many counties reporting a low turnout for in-person voting. Ohio's primary had also been scheduled for Tuesday, but the governor postponed in-person voting there and
polling places were closed
.
The Democratic presidential primary field has narrowed in recent weeks to just Mr. Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and polls in all three states have shown Mr. Biden with a lead.
Stephen Watson, 53, a health-care executive who also voted in Miami, said his trip to the polling station was his first outing after self-quarantining for two weeks because of symptoms he said were consistent with Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus: a temperature of 103 degrees, cough and shortness of breath. He said he wasn't able to confirm he had the virus because he couldn't get tested.
Mr. Watson also voted for Mr. Biden. ""We don't need a revolution,"" he said,
echoing one of Mr. Biden's lines about Mr. Sanders
. ""We just need good leadership.""
In Illinois, there were widespread reports of voters not being able to cast their ballots after polling places closed when election judges didn't show up. Some found handwritten signs telling them the polling site had closed and posted photos on social media.
Election organizers were scrambling to find new polling-place workers in Chicago and suburban counties after hundreds dropped out over concerns about the virus.
Matthew Lindner, 38, who works in marketing in Chicago, said his polling site was moved from a senior citizens home to a church in his neighborhood, with no communication from election officials about the change. A sign at the senior citizens home and the election website confirmed the new location.
But when he got to the church to vote at 8 a.m., poll workers told him that voting machines hadn't made it to the site yet.
""I'm livid with the state,"" he said. ""This is not the first election we've had in Chicago. I think it's 100% related to the pandemic. I've never seen anything like this.""
Mr. Lindner returned to the polling site about five hours later to cast his ballot. The equipment had arrived less than an hour before, and about a dozen people were in line—spaced out about two feet apart. There was no hand sanitizer in sight.
When he reached the front of the line, he and some others were told their precinct had been moved again—to a local library.
LaDonna Miller, 26, a clinical counselor in Chicago, voted early for Mr. Sanders on Monday after hearing about officials still trying to find enough election workers for Tuesday. ""They said there was a shortage of judges,"" she said. ""I had a fear of my polling place being properly staffed.""
Ms. Miller said she waited for two hours in a line with other voters and grew concerned about the conditions they faced. ""We were very clustered together and not following any of the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's] guidelines,"" she said.
Christina Cosentino, 28, a graduate student in Joliet, Ill., said she decided to mail in her ballot for Mr. Biden instead of going to the polls during the outbreak. ""Actually,"" she said. ""I only know a few people who voted today.""

WASHINGTON—President Trump's re-election campaign said Thursday that its war chest stood at more than $100 million headed into the 2020 election year, after raising $46 million in the final three months of 2019.
Mr. Trump faces no significant Republican challenger, putting him at a campaign finance advantage over the many Democrats vying for their party's nomination in a highly competitive and costly primary. Although Mr. Trump is expected to have raised more than any single Democrat last quarter, together those candidates will at least double his haul but are expected to have much less cash on hand.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Where do you expect President Trump's campaign to focus its resources? Where would you like to see them allocated? Join the conversation below.
Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said that this was the president's biggest fundraising quarter during the 2020 campaign cycle, calling him ""an unstoppable juggernaut."" Over the full year, the president's campaign raised a total of $143 million and had $102.7 million in the bank at the end of 2019.
Presidential campaigns must report fourth-quarter fundraising information to the Federal Election Commission by Jan. 31. Mr. Trump's fundraising tops the numbers that have been announced by Democratic presidential hopefuls.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, of Vermont,
brought in $34.5 million
in the final quarter of the year, according to his campaign, and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said he
raised $24.7 million
. Former Vice President Joe Biden said his campaign raised $22.7 million. None of the candidates released updated cash on hand numbers. Some candidates haven't released any numbers yet.
The president also works closely with the Republican National Committee to raise money, and the figures reported by the Trump campaign don't include the RNC's latest finances.
Mr. Trump gave himself an advantage by kicking off his re-election the day he was inaugurated. While recent presidents typically have waited until their third year in office to return to the campaign trail, Mr. Trump
immediately arranged to fundraise
for re-election and never stopped holding the large political rallies that helped him win office in 2016.
Sitting presidents almost always enjoy strong fundraising for re-election. Former President Barack Obama raised about $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, and former President George W. Bush raised $47.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Mr. Bush's campaign had almost $100 million in available cash at the start of his re-election year, the FEC reports show.
An advantage of incumbency is that Mr. Trump has been able to solicit maximum $360,600 donations from individuals, circumventing the far lower $2,800-per-donor cap now in place for the Democratic hopefuls. Those large checks are spread among Mr. Trump's fundraising partners, the RNC and state-level Republican parties. The eventual Democratic nominee also will be able to create a bigger-ticket fundraising program, but Mr. Trump has been benefiting from his arrangement for almost three years already.

Now that Bernie Sanders -- once an obscure socialist senator from Vermont -- is officially the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, it is time to confront what that means.
It does not mean the U.S. is flirting with socialism. That's not going to happen. The meaning of Bernie's ascent is that the Democratic Party, older even than he is, has simply run out of gas.
The Democrats resemble Europe's aging political parties -- Britain's Labour, France's Socialists, Germany's Social Democrats and Christian Democrats. All have simply deflated with voters.
Signs of public fatigue with the Democrats could be seen in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Besides incompetence, the big story out of Iowa was low turnout. In New Hampshire the story was voter indecision. Once past Bernie's 25% cement-block base, many voters were flipping a coin in the voting booth to pick from the other candidates.
What does it mean that Elizabeth Warren, by now a household name, got dropped to fourth place? Joe Biden's humiliating fifth is a personal disaster, but what does that say about the party itself?
Circling overhead is Mike Bloomberg, supposedly the party's savior. The truth is Barack Obama was the party's final savior, and a second coming isn't likely. Recall the talk after the 2016 election about how the Democrats had ""no bench."" They just rolled benchless into 2020.
The Democrats' floundering to find a candidate is deeper than the split between moderates and the left. It looks to me like the accumulated costs of its long history as the self-declared party of government are finally coming due.
The party's problem is that it doesn't look competent anymore. The Iowa caucus debacle came on top of the Trump impeachment, another low-turnout event with the public. People began telling reporters that the three-year death struggle between Democrats and President Trump wasn't their idea of Washington's purpose.
So what, other than hunting Donald Trump, does the Democratic Party stand for?
A recurring argument of this column is that in the U.S. and Europe, the presumed efficiency of governments has been worn down by the programs and responsibilities they've created for themselves, some with good intentions. By now, it's just too much.
During the Depression, Franklin Roosevelt struck a defining bargain with the public: Cede to the government expanded powers over the details of American life, and government will administer it efficiently. For the public, giving government the power to regulate and rule was supposed to be a net plus.
The bargain behind Bernie Sanders's Medicare for All, funded by new taxes on the middle class, is that it too will be a net plus. Come Election Day in November, will 50% of the electorate actually believe Democrats today could competently administer a national health-care system in the U.S.?
Mr. Sanders, who filed as a Democrat for this election, isn't that much of an outlier. All his rivals, including the ""moderates,"" are proposing more additions to the already massive government labyrinth they've built for decades.
But in those places where the modern Democratic Party is in charge, they often govern badly or incompetently on a grand scale. Misgovernance related to crime, homelessness, poor schools and affordability has become the symbol of Democratic control in large U.S. cities such as New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Baltimore, Chicago and St. Louis.
U.S. census data shows people voting with their feet, moving out of the Northeast and Far West into the less bureaucratized Southern and Mountain states. A major reason for these internal refugee flows is that Democratic legislatures and city councils -- New York, Seattle, San Francisco -- reflexively pass progressive policies disconnected from commercial or social reality.
Mike Bloomberg's experience as a Democratic presidential candidate is a case study in the party's flight from basic competence.
The former Republican New York City mayor is running on his record of proven ability, first building his company from nothing into greatness, then running a complex city. But party dogma has forced Mr. Bloomberg to disavow stop-and-frisk, one of the policies that restored order to New York amid a crime crisis.
That success secured Mr. Bloomberg's reputation as a competent public manager. Under his Democratic successor, the progressively pure Bill de Blasio, crime is rising again, along with a generalized sense of administrative incompetence.
Joe Biden tried to run on a greatest hits of legislation. It didn't sell. Elizabeth Warren detailed her expansions of FDR-like government, and voters ran from it.
Look at who's No. 1 and 2. Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg. One is 78, the other is 38, and both are running on not much more than sentiments, levitating themselves above mundane questions of basic competence.
It's notable that Mr. Trump's approval rating has risen while the Democrats debated, campaigned and impeached. Maybe amid the fog of Washington's nonstop wars, voters are making choices about government competence, and concluding that Mr. Trump is by and large what he claimed to be -- a can-do businessman. Imagine voting for that.

WASHINGTON—The Democratic primary is following a similar trajectory to what Republicans experienced four years ago, when a long-shot candidate with a devoted base gained momentum while his party's establishment politicians squabbled over who was best suited to take him on.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist who fell short of winning the Democratic nomination in 2016, has risen to the top of national polls on the heels of a popular vote win in Iowa and a victory in the New Hampshire primary.
A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey of Democratic primary voters
found Mr. Sanders with 27% support
, a double-digit lead over a crowded field of rivals vying to claim the mantle of the so-called alternative. Four of his opponents—former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg—were all clustered within a few points of each other.
The dynamic mirrors a similar point in the Republican presidential race four years ago, when polls showed Donald Trump
gaining ground over a fractured field
of GOP hopefuls who were viewed as more palatable by party stalwarts.
""Close your eyes: There's a septuagenarian presidential candidate with a pretty indestructible level of support who is leading in several early states—who am I talking about?"" said Matt Gorman, an aide to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's unsuccessful 2016 primary campaign. ""Much like Trump, the press and Beltway audiences don't take seriously his ability to win the nomination and keep waiting breathlessly for that inevitable collapse, and neither is happening any time soon.""
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do you see the current Democratic field coalescing behind one candidate? If so, which candidate would that be and why? Join the conversation below.
As Republicans did in 2016,
moderate Democrats have begun fretting
that no candidate will be able to consolidate support and defeat Mr. Sanders. They fear he would lose to President Trump in the general election, though the WSJ/NBC News poll shows Mr. Sanders winning a hypothetical matchup between the two. Republicans' fears four years ago that Mr. Trump would cost them the White House and control of Congress proved wrong.
""Bernie Sanders's campaign is a multiracial, multiethnic, multigenerational campaign of working-class Americans fighting for the values of justice and love,"" said deputy campaign manager Ari Rabin-Havt. ""The fact the elites are scared of our movement says more about them than it does about us.""
Much of the criticism of Mr. Trump centered around signature proposals, such as building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and banning all Muslims from entering the U.S., that his Republican opponents viewed as racist, and he made controversial comments about immigrants and women. Mr. Trump, now 73 years old, also defied the party's conventional views on trade policy.
By contrast, the criticism of Mr. Sanders, who is 78, is more policy-focused. His critics believe his proposed single-payer health-care system, free public college tuition and other ideas are too liberal for the U.S. electorate, though many of his rivals have adopted more moderate versions.
At the time, Mr. Trump's rivals alternated between attacking him and treating him as a sideshow. While candidates including Mr. Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and then-Govs. Chris Christie and John Kasich vied to consolidate support among moderate Republicans and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz fought for grass-roots conservatives, the businessman-turned-reality TV star racked up wins in early nominating contests.
""The establishment no longer picks the nominee in either party,"" said Alex Conant, a former aide to Mr. Rubio's campaign. ""If anything, voters really dislike being told who to vote for.""
""The populist candidates have a ceiling,"" he said. ""But you need to unite the rest of the party against them in order to win.""
For much of 2019, aides to other Democratic campaigns insisted Mr. Sanders had his own ceiling. Now, with him near the top of the delegate hunt and polling in the lead in next-up Nevada, his opponents are struggling with how to criticize Mr. Sanders.
""Like Trump, no matter what you throw at him, it's not going to move his base,"" an aide to a rival candidate said.
The aide said campaigns are likely to begin pointing more to Mr. Sanders's self-ascribed identity as a democratic socialist. During Wednesday's
Democratic presidential candidates' debate
in Nevada, Mr. Sanders dismissed a question about a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll that said two-thirds of those surveyed were uncomfortable with a socialist, pointing out that same poll had him leading the Democratic field.
Earlier this month, Mr. Biden—who is struggling to regain footing after poor performances in Iowa and New Hampshire—said every Democrat running for office in 2020 would have to carry the label of a democratic socialist if Mr. Sanders is the nominee.
""What do you think Trump is going to do with that?"" Mr. Biden said.
Mr. Buttigieg has suggested it would be ""difficult"" for Mr. Sanders to defeat Mr. Trump, and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar raised her hand in a recent Democratic debate when the candidates were asked if they were concerned about ""having a democratic socialist on the top of the ticket.""
""We need someone to head up this ticket that actually brings people with her, instead of shutting them out,"" Ms. Klobuchar said.
Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders weren't longtime members of the party they campaigned to represent. Mr. Trump switched his party affiliation several times before registering as a Republican once again in 2012. Mr. Sanders is an independent in the Senate, although he has caucused with the Democratic Party during his three decades in Congress.
In the 2020 Democratic field, Mr. Bloomberg has held elected office as a Republican and independent, while Warren was once registered as a Republican.
Unlike Mr. Trump, who has changed his views over time on issues such as abortion, Mr. Sanders has largely espoused the same proposals for years. His promises of a Medicare for All health-care system, free college and aggressive approach to climate change have been reflected in variations from the other candidates.
This week, a memo from Mr. Bloomberg's campaign warned that Mr. Sanders might soon become unstoppable.
""The fact is if the state of this race remains status quo—with Biden, Pete and Amy in the race on Super Tuesday—Bernie is likely to open up a delegate lead that seems nearly impossible to overcome,"" campaign manager Kevin Sheekey wrote.
Some Democrats believe Mr. Bloomberg, who didn't enter the race until November and has skipped the early states, is ill-positioned to consolidate a combative Democratic field.
Jennifer Palmieri, a former aide to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, said attempts to stop Mr. Sanders would only make him stronger in the eyes of his supporters.
""He's an unconventional candidate, and it is very hard to run against him,"" she said. ""It's not about his record, it's not about past positions.""
""It's about what he says now and his supporters' belief that he's always held the view of the fundamental change that they think has to happen,"" she added. ""It's about something bigger than just Bernie Sanders.""

HOUSTON—Bernie Sanders's resounding victory in
the weekend's Nevada caucuses
cast him as the clear front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination and enhanced the Vermont senator's argument that he can build a diverse coalition of voters ahead of potentially decisive contests.
At the same time, the senator's latest win, and his momentum ahead of next Saturday's South Carolina primary and the
Super Tuesday contests March 3
, are stirring increasing anxiety among some establishment Democrats who believe a more centrist nominee would have a better chance to beat President Trump in November and help carry down-ballot candidates across the finish line. If Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, performs well on March 3, when more than one-third of the total convention delegates are up for grabs, it could be difficult for any Democratic rivals to overtake him.
Mr. Sanders has said he can expand the electorate by bringing in new voters, which would help him overcome any concerns about ideology in a general election. Nevada, a more diverse state than mostly white Iowa and New Hampshire, gave Mr. Sanders the first opportunity to show he can expand the electorate and build the ""multigeneration, multiracial coalition"" he has said will propel him. This year's Nevada caucuses are on track to break turnout records.
""We have won the popular vote in Iowa, we won the New Hampshire primary, we won the Nevada caucus,"" Mr. Sanders told supporters in Houston on Sunday, at a rally ahead of the March 3 Texas primary. ""Don't tell anybody this, these folks get very, very agitated and nervous, we're gonna win here in Texas, and in November, we're going to defeat Trump here in Texas.""
Mr. Sanders's strong position shows the appeal of running as anti-establishment on both sides of the aisle; Mr. Trump, after all, ran as a GOP outsider in 2016. The Vermont senator's position would have been unimaginable five years ago, when the independent, who has never changed his party affiliation to Democrat in the Senate, launched his first-long shot bid for the presidency.
But with his policy positions long seen as far to the left of many Democrats, many party veterans are haunted by the memory of liberal Sen. George McGovern's 49-state loss to GOP President Richard Nixon in 1972. A nomination of Mr. Sanders would mark a decisive break with the more center-left path forged by Bill Clinton in 1992 and Barack Obama in 2008.

Mr. Sanders leads Mr. Trump
in a poll of a general-election matchup, although his margin is thinner than those of some other top contenders.
With 60% of Nevada precincts having reported by Sunday afternoon, former Vice President Joe Biden—a more moderate candidate who was the national polling leader for most of 2019—was in second place, followed by Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Sen. Amy Klobuchar appeared to be on track for fifth place, while businessman and activist Tom Steyer looked set to place sixth.
Mr. Biden attended church services Sunday in a predominantly black neighborhood of North Charleston, S.C. In an acknowledgment of Mr. Sanders's strength in the three prior contests, Mr. Biden told reporters: ""Whoever wins this primary is going into Super Tuesday very strongly, and I think it's going to be Bernie and me going into Super Tuesday.""

According to entrance polls in Nevada
, Mr. Sanders won nearly every demographic segment—including voters ages 17 to 64, white voters, Latino voters and first time caucus-goers. The only segments he lost to Mr. Biden were black voters, voters over age 65 and voters opposed to a single-payer health-care system. Mr. Sanders supports a program known as Medicare for All.
Mr. Sanders's coalition will be put to the test in the next round of states. In his unsuccessful 2016 primary bid against Hillary Clinton, he struggled to bring in support from minorities. While he trails Mr. Biden in South Carolina, a
Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Friday
showed Messrs. Sanders and Biden running even among black Democratic primary voters nationally, a crucial part of Mr. Biden's constituency in South Carolina and other Southern states.
Mr. Biden mingled with church-goers who generally represent his base of support in the primary. Ken Morris, a 68-year-old retired member of the Marine Corps, said he believed Mr. Sanders couldn't win the general election.
""There's not too many people who believe in socialism,"" Mr. Morris said. ""Joe is more centrist. More people trust him. You can't beat a guy who is all the way to the right by going all the way to the left.""
Voters, particularly those who are younger, say Mr. Sanders's ""consistency"" on the issues of health care, climate change and education is why they back him over the rest of the crowded field. Some older voters who were originally skeptical of Mr. Sanders say they see he has the momentum—backed by a swell of enthusiastic young supporters—to win this cycle.
Steve McCormack, a 49-year-old business owner from the Houston suburb of The Woodlands, attended Mr. Sanders's Houston rally on Sunday. Mr. McCormack voted for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio in the 2016 GOP primary and sat out the general election. But this cycle, he said is going to vote ""blue no matter who,"" and he believes Mr. Sanders may be the nominee.
""I see it might be going this way"" toward Mr. Sanders winning the primary, he said.
Mr. Sanders is benefiting from a fractured field in which voters are splintered among his more moderate opponents. Mr. Trump enjoyed a similar situation on his way to claiming the Republican nomination in 2016, when much of the GOP establishment argued Mr. Trump would turn off too many voters to win the general election.
Super Tuesday states have had less consistent polling than some of the earlier ones, but Mr. Sanders has led recent polls in delegate-rich California and Texas. He has projected confidence about both states and has said a win in California means he would likely be on his way to the nomination.
But some Democrats and groups looking to boost centrists aren't ready to concede the nomination.
""The race is not over, said Jonathan Kott, executive director of the Big Tent Project, which is running ads opposing Mr. Sanders in South Carolina. ""You have a lot of people still in the race, you have a lot of people that could win in different states.""
When asked if nominating Mr. Sanders could put Democrats' House majority in danger, Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, a top member of House Democratic leadership, said on ABC's ""This Week"" that ""a lot of people think so.""
The president's campaign has already signaled it would
tag Democrats as socialists in the general election
, particularly in states like Florida in an attempt to sway Venezuelan- and Cuban-Americans. Mr. Sanders has said his version of democratic socialism is a belief in basic rights for everyone, adding that his policies would be similar to those of former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
After South Carolina, the Democratic field will face former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the approximately $160 million he has spent on television and radio ads across Super Tuesday states, according to data from political-ad tracker Kantar/CMAG. That sum dwarfs that of the next biggest spender, Mr. Steyer. Because Mr. Bloomberg didn't compete in the first four states, Super Tuesday will be the first time candidates face the barrage of ads which could complicate the path for any candidate still in the race.

The presidential election is 10 months away, but Michael Bloomberg's long-shot campaign is running like it's already late October.
The candidate has spent $217 million so far on television and digital advertising, mostly ignoring the Democratic primaries and squarely challenging President Trump. The total is roughly three-quarters of the amount spent by all other campaigns, including Mr. Trump's, combined.
It's the game plan the billionaire used in his campaign for mayor of New York City in 2001, when he outspent his competitor nearly 5 to 1. Big spending has also made his philanthropy a dominant force on climate change, gun control and other issues. And it is how he has managed his lucrative business, paying up to bring in talent.
The flow of cash -- dubbed the Bloomberg effect by media-measurement firm Advertising Analytics LLC -- has upended the financial dynamics of the election. Television ad rates jumped 45% in Houston after the Bloomberg campaign bought $1 million worth of ads in November, Advertising Analytics said. The campaign paid as much as double the going rate for staff and promised jobs to workers through November, whether or not Mr. Bloomberg stays in the race. The candidate, who is funding his run entirely by himself, now has 1,000 campaign staffers.
It's a big part of the reason roughly $20 billion is expected to be spent on political advertising this election cycle, dwarfing the previous record of $12 billion in 2016, according to media research firm, Borrell Associates.
""Everything about what Bloomberg is doing is unprecedented,"" said Rufus Gifford, former finance director for Barack Obama's presidential campaign. Mr. Bloomberg remains a long shot, Mr. Gifford said, ""but when you have Donald Trump as president and one of the 10 richest people running for president, anything can happen.""
Kevin Sheekey, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign manager, said there's more to Mr. Bloomberg's candidacy than his spending, pointing to wealthy but politically inexperienced candidates such as Meg Whitman or Ross Perot who failed in the past. ""Money won't just determine elections,"" he said. ""You have to have a record and a message.""
Lots of rich people have run for office, lots of candidates have claimed excellent business credentials and many have claimed to have top-flight data operations, which Mr. Bloomberg emphasizes. What sets his campaign apart is his $55 billion checkbook.
Mr. Bloomberg is No. 9 on the Forbes list of the world's richest people, ahead of each of the Google founders, either Koch brother and the wealthiest members of the Walton family. A person familiar with the plans said he could spend $500 million on the primaries alone, and Mr. Bloomberg hasn't ruled out spending $1 billion before November if needed.
""Certainly it's going to be disruptive,"" said Robert Wolf, former chairman and CEO of UBS Americas and a longtime Democratic donor. ""We just don't know how yet.""
Mr. Bloomberg, who was mayor of New York from 2002 to 2013, is currently supported by 6% of voters, compared with 27% for former Vice President Joe Biden in the Real Clear Politics average of polls. More voters have a negative than a positive view of Mr. Bloomberg, according to a Quinnipiac University National Poll from mid-December.
Mr. Bloomberg said he entered the race at a moment when polling data suggested voters placed less importance on ideology and more on finding a candidate who could beat Mr. Trump. His campaign believed Mr. Trump was winning the race and was going unchallenged in political ads in competitive states as Democratic candidates focused on the primary battle.
At the time, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was surging. Polls showed Mr. Biden beating Mr. Trump but within the margin of error. Ms. Warren's policies, such as a wealth tax, would likely hurt Mr. Bloomberg, and she is generally disliked by his circle of wealthy New Yorkers, according to a longtime staff member. Mr. Bloomberg has said he will back whoever wins the nomination, even if it is Ms. Warren or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
To offset criticism that he was running out of his own self interest, Mr. Bloomberg pledged $15 million to $20 million to register 500,000 voters before the election. His attacks on Mr. Trump are part of that effort.
""There's a sense that Bloomberg is doing something that the party can't do -- going negative on Trump,"" Mr. Gifford said. ""It's work that the party doesn't have the money to do, and other candidates don't have the ability to do.""
After Mr. Trump's campaign said it had bought a 60-second TV spot during the Super Bowl on Feb. 2, the Bloomberg campaign bought a 60-second spot that will target the president. The Bloomberg campaign declined to disclose how much it was spending for the spot, but advertising tracker Kantar/CMAG estimates it is worth $10 million.
Bloomberg spending has drawn Mr. Trump's attention. When the campaign aired an ad saying the president had broken his promise of protecting those with pre-existing health conditions, Mr. Trump pushed back on Twitter and labeled Mr. Bloomberg ""Mini Mike.""
Mr. Bloomberg's campaign said that because he started late, it is focusing on the Super Tuesday votes on March 3, rather than the early voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire. The plan plays to Mr. Bloomberg's financial advantage and minimizes his weaknesses -- shaking hands and making small talk with voters, and giving stump speeches. The Super Tuesday states, where 40% of delegates will be chosen, instead depend more on television and digital advertising.
In addition to huge TV spending -- $193 million on ads since his campaign began -- the campaign has spent heavily online. It spent $16.1 million on Google ads as of Jan. 11 and $6.8 million on Facebook as of the end of December according to Kantar/CMAG.
Mr. Trump has spent $6.5 million on digital ads, and Tom Steyer, the other billionaire Democratic candidate, has spent $5.6 million since Mr. Bloomberg entered the race in November, as of the end of last year.
The Bloomberg campaign is offering field organizers salaries of $6,000 a month. For state data directors, it's between $10,000 and $12,000 a month, according to job postings.
The campaign's 1,000-person payroll is more typical of an operation in the final months before Election Day. Mr. Biden has roughly 400 campaign staffers, while Mr. Sanders has built an 800-person staff.
The former mayor's late entry into the race has forced the campaign to ""create a sense of momentum and hope people will actually jump on,"" said a person familiar with Mr. Bloomberg's state operations.
Campaign veterans said money won't necessarily bring in the best staff and said many experienced staffers want to work for people they support. Other campaigns, including Ms. Warren's and Mr. Sanders's, already have operations in Super Tuesday states and are ramping up hiring in later states.
Mr. Bloomberg has spent in markets that haven't been targeted by other Democrats. His campaign has plunked down $21.2 million on television advertising in Texas, where none of the leading Democrats have spent a penny. It has spent $8.4 million in Pennsylvania, which doesn't hold its primary until April 28.
It has even poured resources into smaller states that are typically not on the primary radar. In Idaho, it has spent $979,000 so far; in Utah, $1.6 million.
""He is going far, far ahead of where the rest of the guys are scrumming,"" said Kip Cassino, executive vice president at Borrell Associates, the media research firm. ""He is basically saying, 'I'm not going to win in Iowa, and I am not going to get out there and kiss pigs. And I won't win in New Hampshire, but I will win in the rest of the states, and I will get the states that most everyone didn't care about before.'""
At the beginning of January, candidates had spent close to $540 million on political ads in the presidential race over the prior 12 months, about 10 times what would have been expected at this point in this election cycle, Mr. Cassino said.
""We have never seen anything like this,"" Mr. Cassino said, referring to Mr. Bloomberg's spending. ""We are only just starting to see how distorting this might be.""
Mr. Bloomberg's potential handicaps among Democratic voters include his support for Republican candidates in the past, including former President George W. Bush. Other issues that could hurt are his support for charter schools in his education-reform efforts, and the stop-and-frisk policy he adopted as mayor, in which New York police had wide latitude to detain and search passersby for contraband. A federal judge eventually ruled the policy violated the constitutional rights of minorities. Mr. Bloomberg apologized for the stop-and-frisk policy before he kicked off his campaign.
Some Democrats fear Mr. Bloomberg could drag out the primary with his limitless budget, or use his money to try to influence the leading candidates, hoping to pull some of them to the political center, which he sees as the way to beat Mr. Trump.
Mr. Bloomberg's team said the data operation he is building will benefit Democrats overall, which he said are far behind the Republicans on the gathering and use of voter data. His data firm, Hawkfish LLC, launched in the spring. It has hired Facebook's former chief marketing officer and the former CEO of Foursquare, the location tracking firm.
Mr. Bloomberg has cited his research and spending on the 2018 midterm elections as evidence of his commitment to the party's success. Democratic candidates won 21 of the 24 races in which he was involved. In most races, the spending focused on digital advertising early in the election cycle and TV advertising closer to election day, when ad reservations were more expensive and Republican groups could not as easily counter their message.
In an Oklahoma House of Representatives race, which appeared to be a long-shot for the Democrats, Mr. Bloomberg unleashed a wave of last-minute ads that attacked the Republican candidate. Democrat Kendra Horn won by a few thousand votes.
""I supported 24 candidates who were good on guns and good on environment, and 21 of them won, and that flipped the House,"" he said at a recent campaign stop in Philadelphia. ""So if it wasn't for that, you wouldn't have [Speaker of the House Nancy] Pelosi and you wouldn't have impeachment.""

CRESCO, Iowa -- When Democrats start their presidential nomination voting with this state's caucuses early next month, voters like Joe Wacha hang in the balance.
After backing Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, the 63-year-old greenhouse manager says he switched to Donald Trump in 2016. A large number of his fellow Howard County voters did the same.
The rural county, located in northeast Iowa near the Minnesota border, is the only one of America's more than 3,000 counties that voted by more than 20 percentage points for Mr. Obama in 2012 and by more than 20 percentage points for Mr. Trump in 2016. It swung 41 points, the second-biggest flip in the nation.
Recent interviews with dozens of voters here suggest that most of Mr. Trump's 2016 supporters, including Mr. Wacha, plan to stick with him, even though some said they have grown weary of his personal behavior and trade fights. Among those who previously voted for both Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump, many said they are reserving judgment until they see who wins the Democratic nomination.
As for Mr. Trump's impeachment trial, now under way in the Senate, most voters said they haven't followed the case closely and don't expect it to weigh heavily in their decisions. Several said they view it as just more Washington partisanship.
What such swing voters do in 2020 will have national implications. Before Mr. Trump, Howard County hadn't backed a Republican for president since Ronald Reagan in 1984. It is one of the 31 counties in Iowa -- the most of any state -- that backed Mr. Obama twice and then switched to Mr. Trump.
The president won in 2016 partly because he ran up huge victories in small, heavily rural counties. While he is likely to win such areas again, margins could matter. If Democrats can keep him from racking up the kind of gains he did in places like Howard County in 2016, that could help determine whether he will again carry battleground states such as Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
Howard County isn't an overtly partisan place. Almost half of its voters -- 46.8% -- are registered as independents, high enough to rank fourth among Iowa's 99 counties. Trade, government spending and health care were among the most frequently mentioned issues when voters were asked what will help decide their vote.
For Mr. Wacha, the greenhouse manager, all the talk in the Democratic primary race about expanding the role of government is turning him off. ""I wouldn't vote for any of the Democrats running right now,"" he said. ""A lot of their platforms are too far to the left, with free health care and college. None of them have a solution for how to pay for all of this except raising taxes.""
Members of the white working class have been the heart of Mr. Trump's political base, and Howard County is dominated by such voters.
The county's population is 96.4% non-Hispanic white, compared with a national average of 60.4%. It also is less educated than the national norm, with just 14.9% of those 25 and older having a bachelor's degree or higher, compared with 31.5% nationally.
Neil Shaffer, the local Republican Party chairman, sees three main reasons the county flipped so dramatically in 2016: too many new regulations on farmers and water quality, the ""baggage that Hillary arrived with,"" and because rural America likes antiestablishment candidates.
""I believe the county really looks at an individual candidate, not so much a party,"" he said. ""People liked that idea of someone coming in to shake things up.""
A mix of flatland and rolling hills, the county sits atop some of the world's richest soil. Grain silos and church steeples are the tallest structures.
Norman Borlaug, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work to feed the world by helping improve wheat production, was born in the county, but family farms like the one he was raised on are increasingly giving way to corporate agriculture, a transition loaded with anxiety.
The county has received $330 million in agricultural subsidy payments since the mid-1990s, according to the Environmental Working Group in Washington, which opposes such payments. Even so, there is sentiment here that those in capital cities such as Des Moines and Washington are always steering more resources to urban areas, while burdening rural residents with added regulation. Local Democratic and Republican leaders say Mr. Trump's antiestablishment message tapped into those feelings and turned them into political support.
Mr. Trump's supporters said his tariffs have hurt both the county's manufacturing and agricultural sectors. Yet nearly all of the independent or Republican-leaning voters interviewed said they think he has taken on a fight long overdue.
Brandon Reis, a 37-year-old farmer registered as an independent, said his top issue when considering whom to support in 2020 is trade. He declined to say whom he voted for in 2016, but is frustrated with how Mr. Trump has dealt with China.
""It needed to be done, to some degree, but I feel like it has been done poorly,"" he said. ""It has been done in fits and starts, and I don't feel like there was fortitude to go all the way through and finish it.""
Mr. Reis, who with his wife and parents farms about 2,000 acres, said his family's hog operation has been hurt by the trade dispute at a time when the Chinese supply of pork is down because of swine-fever disease there.
""That reduction in their herd created what could have been a huge opportunity,"" he said. ""We are watching that opportunity dry up.""
Besides raising corn and soybeans, the Reis operation produces about 15,000 hogs a year. Prices have ticked up slightly in recent months, but Mr. Reis said his family was losing money on pork for roughly half of 2019.
Mr. Reis said his vote will also be determined by who he thinks is being the most honest. ""I will almost be voting on fortitude: the people willing to tell the hard truths,"" he said. ""It feels like both sides are just telling people what they want to hear.""
About three-quarters of the county's economy is directly tied to agriculture, estimated Andy Ludeking, a 38-year-old Obama-Trump voter who is a vice president of Cresco Bank. Mr. Ludeking said he is open to voting for someone other than Mr. Trump in the fall.
""I don't think he's a great person, but I do like some of the business stuff he's done,"" he said. ""The choices we were given in the last election weren't that great.""
At a recent Saturday afternoon high-school wrestling match, several younger parents said they returned to the county after attending college elsewhere because of family ties and quality-of-life considerations.
""It's a good community and a good place to raise kids,"" said Courtney Shimek, a 32-year-old mother of two who works as an accountant and with her husband on their 100-acre farm. ""We don't have a Target store down the street, but we have a lot of other good things.""
Ms. Shimek likes Mr. Trump's efforts to build a wall on the southern border of the U.S. ""It's not going to solve all our problems by any means, but it's going to help,"" she said.
After supporting Mr. Trump in 2016, she expects to do so again this year. ""Do I agree with everything he does? Absolutely not,"" she said. ""But I think we are headed in the right direction.""
The county, with about 9,200 residents in 2018, has seen its population decline 3.9% since 2010. That isn't as much as some rural counties in the state, but well below the national population gain of 6% during the period.
With historically low unemployment -- 1.9% in November -- many of the county's employers are desperate for workers. A lack of new housing and child care, plus limited retail and restaurants, makes it hard to attract new employees.
Amy Bouska, a 71-year-old member of Cresco's city council and a Democrat, said new housing is a top local issue. A lack of investors willing to build new housing, she said, prevents workers from moving to the area. ""We've got jobs we can't fill,"" she said.
Gary Gooder, a 59-year-old president of a local manufacturing company, said his business and the county in general have seen an economic uptick since Mr. Trump's election. ""We did all right during the Obama years, but, you know, we weren't kicking up into that next gear,"" he said.
Mr. Gooder, a Republican who plans to again vote for Mr. Trump, said the price he pays for the aluminum he uses to make trailers and other products has increased by about 25% because of tariffs. So far, he has managed to pass most of that along to customers.
Barry Christensen and his family have been working the county's rich farmland for five decades. The 39-year-old farmer and seed-corn salesman returned to the county in 2007 to work with his family's 2,000-acre operation after he attended college and worked in the corporate office of a food-processing company in Colorado for five years.
Mr. Christensen voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, after voting for Mr. Obama in 2012. He said he is leaning toward Mr. Trump again, depending on whom the Democrats nominate. Although farm commodity prices are depressed, Mr. Christensen said his stock-market investments are doing well and he is generally positive about the economy.
Mr. Christensen said Mr. Trump's impeachment won't affect his vote. ""It's a show,"" he said. ""It feels like it was done to damage him for November.""
Chuck Weida likes the president's outspokenness and plans to vote for him again. On a recent morning, Mr. Weida sat wearing a red baseball cap near a sign at Sue-Z-Q's, a popular cafe on the edge of town, that says ""Sit Long, Talk Much."" The 71-year-old retired manufacturing worker from nearby Riceville, Iowa, said he took his cap, which had an American flag on the front, to a local embroidery shop to have ""Trump 2020"" added to the side.
""I fear that if he doesn't get re-elected, the Democrats are going to go socialist,"" said Mr. Weida's wife, Linda, a 70-year-old nursing-home worker.
Laura Hubka, the county's Democratic Party chairwoman, said a moderate Democrat such as former Vice President Joe Biden or Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., might have a chance of winning the county against Mr. Trump. She doesn't think more-liberal candidates, like Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts or Bernie Sanders of Vermont, would have as good a chance.
""This is not a liberal bastion,"" said Ms. Hubka, a 55-year-old health-care worker. ""People that are here work for a living -- they feel like they have to do work -- and that nothing was given to them for free. And I think they look at maybe Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders as someone that wants to give people things, and that doesn't play well here.""

HOUSTON -- Bernie Sanders's resounding victory in the weekend's Nevada caucuses cast him as the clear front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination and enhanced the Vermont senator's argument that he can build a diverse coalition of voters ahead of potentially decisive contests.
At the same time, the senator's latest win, and his momentum ahead of next Saturday's South Carolina primary and the Super Tuesday contests March 3, are stirring increasing anxiety among some establishment Democrats who believe a more centrist nominee would have a better chance to beat President Trump in November and help carry down-ballot candidates across the finish line. If Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, performs well on March 3, when more than one-third of the total convention delegates are up for grabs, it could be difficult for any Democratic rival to overtake him.
Mr. Sanders has said he can expand the electorate by bringing in new voters, which would help him overcome any concerns about ideology in a general election.
Nevada, a more diverse state than mostly white Iowa and New Hampshire, gave Mr. Sanders the first opportunity to show he can build the ""multigeneration, multiracial coalition"" he has said will propel him. This year's Nevada caucuses are on track to break turnout records.
""We have won the popular vote in Iowa, we won the New Hampshire primary, we won the Nevada caucus,"" Mr. Sanders told supporters in Houston on Sunday, at a rally ahead of the March 3 Texas primary. ""Don't tell anybody this, these folks get very, very agitated and nervous, we're gonna win here in Texas, and in November, we're going to defeat Trump here in Texas.""
Mr. Sanders's strong position shows the appeal of running as antiestablishment on both sides of the aisle; Mr. Trump, after all, ran as a GOP outsider in 2016. The Vermont senator's position would have been unimaginable five years ago, when the independent, who has never changed his party affiliation to Democrat in the Senate, launched his first long-shot bid for the presidency.
But with his policy positions long seen as far to the left of many Democrats, many party veterans are haunted by the memory of liberal Sen. George McGovern's 49-state loss to GOP President Richard Nixon in 1972. A nomination of Mr. Sanders would mark a decisive break with the more center-left path forged by Bill Clinton in 1992 and Barack Obama in 2008.
Mr. Sanders leads Mr. Trump in a poll of a general-election matchup, although his margin is thinner than those of some other top contenders.
With about 88% of Nevada precincts reporting Sunday evening, former Vice President Joe Biden -- a more moderate candidate who was the national polling leader for most of 2019 -- was in second place, followed by Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Billionaire activist Tom Steyer looked set to place fifth while Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar followed closely behind in sixth.
Mr. Biden attended church services on Sunday in a predominantly black neighborhood of North Charleston, S.C. In an acknowledgment of Mr. Sanders's strength in the three prior contests, Mr. Biden told reporters: ""Whoever wins this primary is going into Super Tuesday very strongly, and I think it's going to be Bernie and me going into Super Tuesday.""
According to entrance polls in Nevada, Mr. Sanders won nearly every demographic segment -- including voters ages 17 to 64, white voters, Latino voters and first time caucus-goers. The only segments he lost to Mr. Biden were black voters, voters over age 65 and voters opposed to a single-payer health-care system.
Mr. Sanders's coalition will be put to the test in the next round of states. In his unsuccessful 2016 primary bid against Hillary Clinton, he struggled to bring in support from minorities.
While Mr. Sanders trails Mr. Biden in South Carolina, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Friday showed the two men running even among black Democratic primary voters nationally, a crucial part of Mr. Biden's constituency.
Mr. Biden mingled with churchgoers who generally represent his base of support. Ken Morris, a 68-year-old retired member of the Marine Corps, said he believed Mr. Sanders couldn't win the general election.
""There's not too many people who believe in socialism,"" Mr. Morris said. ""Joe is more centrist. More people trust him. You can't beat a guy who is all the way to the right by going all the way to the left.""
Voters, particularly those who are younger, say Mr. Sanders's consistency on the issues of health care, climate change and education is why they back him. Some older voters who were skeptical of Mr. Sanders say they see he has the momentum -- backed by a swell of enthusiastic young supporters -- to win.
Steve McCormack, a 49-year-old business owner from the Houston suburb of The Woodlands, attended Mr. Sanders's Houston rally on Sunday. Mr. McCormack voted for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio in the 2016 GOP primary and sat out the general election.
But this cycle, Mr. McCormack said is going to vote ""blue no matter who,"" and he believes Mr. Sanders may be the nominee.
""I see it might be going this way"" toward Mr. Sanders winning the primary, he said.
But some Democrats and groups looking to boost centrists aren't ready to concede.
""The race is not over, said Jonathan Kott, executive director of the Big Tent Project, which is running ads opposing Mr. Sanders in South Carolina. ""You have a lot of people still in the race, you have a lot of people that could win in different states.""

OXON HILL, Md.—The impeachment of President Trump motivated her to fly up from Texas, but after a half day at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Cathie Broten was convinced a more sinister force is in play.
""It's like Custer's Last Stand: the Republicans vs. the socialists,"" said Ms. Broten, 70 years old, wearing a pin reading, ""Kiss me, I'm a capitalist.""
Mr. Trump, greeted by wild applause as he took the CPAC stage on Saturday afternoon, sought to portray Democrats as seeking policies that would turn the U.S. into a ""large-scale Venezuela.""
""But we will never let them do that,"" he said. Mr. Trump trash-talked the Democratic presidential candidates, at one point ducking down to mock Michael Bloomberg's height.
He acknowledged the rise of Sen. Bernie Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist, as the front-runner for the party's nomination. He asked the crowd to cheer to indicate which candidate he should compete against in November, either Mr. Sanders or former Vice President Joe Biden.
By the cheers, the crowd seemed itching for the ideological showdown that is the official theme of the four-day CPAC conference: America vs. Socialism. ""We'll probably end up with Crazy Bernie,"" Mr. Trump said.
The event's theme shows how Republicans plan to frame the November election, with or without Mr. Sanders as the nominee. Repeatedly, speakers portrayed the Democrats' agenda on health care, the environment, college tuition and other issues as an attempt to radically transform America.
""Donald Trump and his allies are getting a little bit nervous about facing Sen. Sanders in a general election, and they're all quickly realizing that the only way to attack someone who spent his entire life standing with the working class is to lie,"" said Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca.
Amid the ""crazy Bernie"" and communist Cuba references at CPAC were warnings about being overconfident.
""Get your laughs out of the way and get the mockery out of the way and then get deathly serious,"" said the young conservative activist Charlie Kirk. ""Because we should not do what the left did in 2016 and dismiss an outsider populist candidate from thinking that person can't win the White House.""
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How can President Trump's relationship with CPAC benefit him during the 2020 election season? Join the conversation below.
When Mr. Trump spoke at CPAC in 2011, saying he might run for president the following year, many in the Republican establishment laughed it off as a publicity grab. He skipped it in 2016 while some conservatives still fought to prevent his march to the nomination.
This year showed how Mr. Trump commands the GOP, injecting his own sense of grievance and fight. The mere mention of Mitt Romney, the party's 2012 nominee who
voted earlier this month in the Senate to convict Mr. Trump
on one article of impeachment, brought boos. Conference-goers stuffed ballot boxes to judge the ""phoniest"" conservative, picking from a list of other Republicans who have criticized Mr. Trump.
Before noon on Thursday, attendees had sat through four panels focused on ""the coup,"" with speakers dismissing the impeachment and other investigations into Mr. Trump as the work of Democrats and a bureaucratic deep state.
""They're never going to stop,"" said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio. ""They tried to overturn the will of 63 million Americans—all of us who voted for President Trump.""
Democrats hit back at claims like Mr. Jordan's, calling it ""the oldest trick in the GOP playbook.""
""Republicans are trying to distract because they know they can't win on the issues. In 2017, 2018 and 2019 Democrats won on a message of expanding access to health care,"" said Daniel Wessel, a Democratic National Committee spokesman.
In addition to panels, actors Dean Cain and Kristy Swanson performed a dramatic reading of anti-Trump text messages between former FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, favorite targets of Mr. Trump in his complaints about the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
The CPAC gathering in past years was animated by Ron Paul-style libertarians; now it is dominated by Trump loyalists in red MAGA hats as the president continues to redefine the GOP on foreign policy and trade. There was little mention of the ballooning national debt.
For some, it was a venue to apologize for being wrong about Mr. Trump in 2016.
""Look, I was late to the Trump train,"" said Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. ""I was about as late as one can be. I had my doubts about whether he was a conservative. I had my doubts about whether he was electable."" But Mr. Lee said the president has followed through on his promises, including moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, slashing regulations and nominating conservative judges.
Vice President Mike Pence ticked off those accomplishments and the strong economy and
declared victory over the impeachment
. ""President Donald Trump was acquitted forever,"" he said to wild cheers. Like others, Mr. Pence acknowledged the appeal of Mr. Sanders's policy proposals to young people in particular and said Republicans must engage them and explain the differences between ""freedom and socialism.""
""We definitely need to a better job of reaching young people and address their concerns,"" said Alexander Bowles, 18, of St. Louis, who said Mr. Trump also should moderate the way he speaks to avoid losing more suburban voters.
Outside the ballroom, people who have become celebrities in the Trump era were flocked by fans. Biceps poking from a black T-shirt, the Fox News regular Dan Bongino posed for selfies. Nigel Farage, one of Brexit's most-visible architects, was greeted with applause as he rode down an escalator holding a wooden doll depicting Mr. Trump.
Vendors sold Trump hats, towels, T-shirts and pins. A red-white-and-blue hammock with the word ""Deplorable"" was being offered at 10% off the $499 price tag with an extra 10% discount for anyone from a battleground state.

RALEIGH, N.C. -- Democratic voters from here to California said they struggled to choose between pragmatism and policy on Tuesday, mirroring a national debate over whether sweeping political and economic changes or moderation were the keys to defeating President Trump.
Freelance marketing consultant Julie Cook, who had considered Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders because of his health-care plans, woke up Tuesday planning to vote for former Vice President Joe Biden, but hours later bubbled in former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Ms. Cook said she liked that Mr. Bloomberg plans to spend whatever it takes to win, noting she has struggled to explain Mr. Trump's verbose behavior to her 4- and 6-year-old daughters.
Mr. Trump ""is ridiculous,"" said Ms. Cook, 37 years old. ""It's gotten to the point that I can't stand to look at him on TV anymore.""
In Houston, onetime Hillary Clinton-backer Julia Kibbel voted for Mr. Sanders because of her work with the uninsured as a nurse practitioner in the county health department.
""He seems to be consistent, and he's more"" focused on social services, said Ms. Kibbel, 40.
Mr. Biden enjoyed a boost in the 72 hours before Super Tuesday, scoring a blowout win in South Carolina's primary Saturday and then securing endorsements from three opponents who left the race -- former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke.
Many voters said the recent near-daily shifts in the Democratic field have made their choices fluid.
In Modesto, Calif., semi-retired ironworker Scott Szuggar, 54, said he was glad he held on to his mail-in ballot for a week.
""I kind of had a feeling that people were going to drop out,"" he said, as he left his ballot at a downtown voting center.
Mr. Szuggar said he had been leaning toward Mr. Bloomberg but cast his vote for Mr. Biden because he seemed to have momentum. ""He is starting to pick up a little steam here,"" he said.
Andrew Morrison, 50, a resident of Los Alamitos, Calif., who works in plastics manufacturing, voted for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, though he said she wasn't likely to get the nomination. ""If she can pick up some California delegates, it gives her more power to become a player later,"" he said.
At the Community College of Denver, Rebecca Turner, 26, an eco-psychology major, voted early for Mr. Sanders but worries that he may not fare well in the general election.
""In a perfect world, Bernie Sanders would be my president,"" she said. If he doesn't get the nomination, she said she would vote for Mr. Biden. ""Bernie is the, 'Oh I wish,' and Biden is the 'That'll probably do.'""
In Raleigh, roofer Larry Bostic, 34, said he chose Mr. Biden after watching last week's feisty debate in Charleston, S.C. ""That thing was fierce,"" he said. ""Biden was the only one up there maintaining professionalism. Everyone else was throwing jabs. We don't need that right now.""
Mr. Bostic, who is African-American, said Mr. Sanders's criminal-justice policies would help some of his friends who have made bad choices. But he said he couldn't get comfortable with his style.
""Imagine if you went to work one day and somebody asked you what you were doing and you just went, 'Rah rah!'"" he said, holding up his arms and shaking his wrists. ""You got to leave your feelings at the door a little bit.""
Lighting a cigarette, Mr. Bostic looked at the ground and said he had to admit that he had considered not voting. He said he had felt like his vote for Mrs. Clinton in 2016 didn't count when she won the popular vote but Mr. Trump won the White House.
""It feels hopeless to a lot of Americans,"" he said. ""But the idea of not doing anything and having an opinion? If you're not going to vote, don't complain.""

Joe Biden won all three primaries held Tuesday on a day filled with anxious voting, building a lead in the Democratic presidential nomination race that appears increasingly difficult for Bernie Sanders to overcome.
For up-to-the-minute news on the Democratic presidential primaries, please see
WSJ's Live Coverage

The two-man race lurched forward against major disruptions triggered by
the coronavirus pandemic
as the first balloting was held—in Florida, Illinois and Arizona—since the crisis engulfed the nation. As of Wednesday morning, the former vice president had 52.8% of the delegates allocated so far and 57.6% of the number needed to win the nomination.
In Florida, a critical battleground state in the general election, Mr. Biden won nearly three times as many votes as the Vermont senator and carried all 67 counties. With 99% of Illinois precincts reporting, Mr. Biden had 59.1% of the vote versus 36.1% for Mr. Sanders. In Arizona, with 88% of the vote in, the former vice president had 43.6% against his rival's 31.6%.
The latest large victories for Mr. Biden are likely to place more pressure on Mr. Sanders to exit from the race so the party can focus on President Trump. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Sunday showed
Mr. Biden was favored nationally, 61% to 32%
, among those who have already voted in the Democratic primary or plan to do so.
Mr. Biden, speaking from his home in Wilmington, Del., said his campaign is moving toward winning the nomination as he reached out to his rival's supporters. He delivered his address via a live stream to avoid gathering supporters during the pandemic.
""We've moved closer to securing the Democratic Party's nomination for president, and we're doing it by building a broad coalition,"" he said.
Mr. Biden said he and Mr. Sanders ""may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision"" on issues such as health care, wealth inequality and climate change. He told young voters inspired by Mr. Sanders, ""I hear you, I know what's at stake.""
Mr. Biden already is trying to unify the party behind him, endorsing policy proposals related to bankruptcy laws and college tuition
in a bid to woo liberals
. Mr. Sanders acknowledged last week that he's losing the ""debate over electability"" among Democrats.
During a live stream address Tuesday evening, Mr. Sanders outlined his proposals to blunt the effects of the coronavirus outbreak. He didn't mention the primary elections or his narrowing prospects.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee noted Tuesday night that Mr. Trump had secured enough delegates through the GOP primaries to become the party's ""presumptive nominee"" for president.
""Nobody motivates our base more than President Trump, as evidenced by the historic turnout we've seen in state after state this primary season,"" Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement. ""Fueled by both our longtime supporters and the thousands of new voters that continue to join our movement, we are united and enthusiasm is on our side.""
Ohio had been expected to hold a primary on Tuesday, but it joined a growing list of states
that have delayed their contests
until May or June in hopes the coronavirus situation will improve.
On the eve of the balloting, a court there rejected a request to postpone the state's primary until June 2 as Republican Gov. Mike DeWine had recommended. The in-person voting was subsequently placed on hold after the state's top health official ordered polls closed.
The Ohio Supreme Court denied a last-minute legal challenge to the postponement, and county election boards were deluged with phone calls from confused, frustrated voters.
In a statement released late Tuesday, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez called for states with upcoming primaries and caucuses to use vote by mail and other alternatives to casting ballots in person.
""What happened in Ohio last night has only bred more chaos and confusion,"" he said, adding that states should focus on figuring out how to make voting easier and safer as opposed to postponing primaries ""when timing around the virus remains unpredictable.""
This round of contests might be the last significant ones for some time, if more states announce primary postponements.

Voters, sobered by the crisis, also cast ballots in local and state contests as they confronted school closures, travel limitations, event cancellations and a stressed global economy. Germs were also on their minds.
At a polling location inside a Miami fire station, workers wore gloves as they inspected voter identification cards and dispensed hand sanitizer to visitors. Some voters arrived with their own pens, gloves and disinfecting wipes.
Officials in Chicago, the biggest city within the three states that voted Tuesday, said election-day turnout was low as nervous voters stayed home. Still, many had cast ballots early. Officials said the previous primary record for such voting was easily surpassed and vote-by-mail applications more than tripled compared with 2016.
James Allen, a Chicago Board of Election Commissioners spokesman, told reporters Tuesday that city election officials failed last week to convince Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker to cancel in-person voting and replace it with vote-by-mail balloting.
Pritzker spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh said in a statement that the governor's office had offered ""to provide the National Guard to help staff the election"" as well as assistance in recruiting volunteers to fill in for election workers anxious about staffing polling places.
Share Your Thoughts
Were you surprised by the results from Tuesday's primaries, and why? Join the conversation below.
""The governor cannot unilaterally cancel or delay an election,"" she said. ""Elections are the cornerstone of our democracy and we could not risk confusion and disenfranchisement in the courts. No one is saying this is a perfect solution. We have no perfect solutions at the moment. We only have the least bad solutions.""
Some Chicago polls opened late because workers didn't show up or equipment wasn't delivered on time, while some voters were confused about where they were supposed to vote after about 200 of the city's 2,069 precinct voting locations had to be moved.
Voting-rights advocates said they fielded questions from confused voters and poll workers in multiple states because of changes made to polling locations to avoid nursing homes and other vulnerable sites.
""It's unprecedented for us to be addressing this much confusion around basic questions that voters have during a primary election, like where is my polling place,"" Ami Gandhi, senior counsel at the Chicago Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, told reporters.

Anya McGrath said she voted for Mr. Sanders inside an elementary school auditorium in the city's Mar Vista neighborhood. ""He is just more in touch with people like me, middle America,"" said Ms. McGrath, 36, a preschool teacher. ""He speaks for underserved people. I'm kind of all about getting money out of the hands of billionaires and getting it back to the people.""

MANCHESTER, N.H. -- States conducting presidential nominating contests in the coming weeks are facing new scrutiny of their voting processes, after glitches caused confusion over which candidate prevailed in Iowa's caucuses.
Federal and local law-enforcement officials huddled at a Manchester conference center on Friday morning, gaming out responses to hypothetical hacking scenarios ahead New Hampshire's Tuesday primary. The meeting included representatives from the U.S. Secret Service and from the police forces of Manchester, Concord and Nashua, along with private-sector experts.
The Manchester gathering, which had been scheduled for months, is one example of intensified efforts nationwide to secure the voting process since 2016, when Russia was found to have interfered in the U.S. presidential election.
Such efforts have taken on a new urgency after Iowa's debacle. The failure of a results-reporting app, due to what the Iowa Democratic Party called a coding issue and a series of problems cascading from those glitches, showed that foreign meddling isn't the only risk, experts say.
""When you see what happened in Iowa,"" said former Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis, who participated in the Manchester event, ""we can tell that this is a very real threat.""
The cause of Iowa's problems ""was very likely not malicious,"" said Yonatan Striem-Amit, chief technology officer and co-founder of Cybereason, a security firm which has organized election security meetings, including the one in Manchester. It appeared to be unintentional glitches, he said.
Iowa, in some respects, is an outlier. It is one of only a handful of states to have presidential caucuses that are run by state parties and aren't regulated like primaries, which are overseen by state and local bureaucrats.
In Nevada, the third early nominating state, the state Democratic Party scrapped a caucus results app after a similar one failed in Iowa. It is now cobbling together a new plan for its Feb. 22 caucuses.
""We eliminated the option of using any app at any stage of our caucus process and right now, we're testing and fully evaluating our backup plan to ensure it is secure, efficient, and simple,"" party spokeswoman Molly Forgey said Saturday.
Officials in North Dakota and Wyoming, both caucus states, said they won't use such apps.North Dakota's process is different from Iowa's caucuses, where supporters physically separate into groups for their candidate. Instead, North Dakota voters can show up on March 10 to their polling locations and mark paper ballots, or vote early by mail.
Democrats in Wyoming give voters the option to mail or drop off paper ballots ahead of their April 4 caucuses.
David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said the Iowa case was unusual and that election officials generally allow time for more thorough testing, training and certification before deploying new technology.The Iowa Democratic Party's race to commission and deploy a new app ""doesn't look like any kind of plan that any election official in the country has ever employed,"" Mr. Becker said.
Many states, for instance, freeze changes to election systems 90 days before voting, said Maurice Turner, an election expert at the nonprofit Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington.
In New Hampshire, voters typically fill out paper ballots that voting machines scan, with the original saved for record-keeping. ""We don't have apps that deal with voting or tallying the votes,"" said New Hampshire's chief election official Bill Gardner.
Elsewhere, there are efforts to expand mobile voting -- casting ballots by smartphone -- which supporters say will increase participation by making voting more convenient. But some security experts say personal smartphones are difficult to protect.
West Virginia is expanding mobile voting to support voters with physical disabilities, as well as overseas and military voters. The state allowed some overseas and military voters to cast ballots using their smartphones in 2018.
""Our election workers will be trained and ready,"" said Michael Queen, deputy chief of staff to West Virginia's Secretary of State.
Meanwhile, the Associated Press said it still can't declare a winner in the Iowa caucuses after reviewing updated results provided by the state's Democratic Party on Sunday evening. The Iowa Democratic Party's latest results, from all precincts, show Pete Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Ind., ahead of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders by two state delegate equivalents out of 2,152 counted.

Maryland Glitch
Puts Plan on Pause
Some say Iowa's problems show the need for elections to be run by career bureaucrats, but such systems aren't immune to glitches.
In Maryland last week, a day after the Iowa caucuses, state election officials rolled out an expanded wireless network for a special congressional primary in Baltimore. Voters in both parties chose nominees to run for the seat once held by Rep. Elijah Cummings, who died in October.
The network was designed to transfer information such as who registered at polling places to the state election office, but it didn't work as planned.
The network connected electronic pollbooks -- which poll workers use to check in voters -- to a state government server, said Nikki Charlson, deputy state administrator of elections. The pollbooks are separate from ballot machines, she said.
The state, which recently introduced same-day voter registration, planned to require some large jurisdictions to use the networking equipment in its April 28 primary. But state officials on Friday put that plan on pause after the network delayed checking in some voters, forcing officials to shut it down by disconnecting the pollbooks from the network.
Doing so resolved the delays within about an hour after they were reported to state officials, Ms. Charlson said, adding that it didn't stop anyone from voting or affecting the results.

It was pretty clear the 2020 presidential election was going to be divisive. Who would have guessed it would contribute to the splintering of one of the most famous political groups in hip-hop history?
On Sunday, Public Enemy, the pioneering rap group, announced it was parting ways with longtime member Flavor Flav. He and
Chuck D, the group's leader
, had been quarreling for some time. Politics played a role. So did money. And now we have another topic on which the nation is split.
Flavor Flav's camp said the star didn't want his likeness used to promote Chuck D's performance at a campaign rally for Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders. Chuck D's defenders say politics has little to do with it, and that Flavor Flav simply won't appear if he isn't paid, which they find anathema to Public Enemy's social-minded mission.
The very public spat has
rap music fans
engaging in a debate of their own—over Flavor Flav and Chuck D,
the legacy of hip-hop's first explicitly political superstar group
and the role of music in politics.
""The situation is indicative of a bigger problem, regarding the growing political divide in this country,"" says James Payton, a 35-year-old information security analyst in Texas, and a fan. Added a user on Twitter: ""Lot of people need to decide: Are you Chuck D or do you want to be Flavor Flav?""
In the 1980s, Public Enemy, which also included Terminator X and Professor Griff, revolutionized hip-hop by making it directly political, including on their landmark 1988 album, ""It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back,"" and songs such as ""Fight the Power.""
Before Public Enemy, many rap artists such as Run-DMC were relatively lighthearted. Public Enemy's protest anthems and militant image were novel and shocking for mainstream audiences. The group entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013 in its first year of eligibility—one of the first hip-hop entrants.
A key ingredient in Public Enemy's sauce was the balance between Chuck D and Flavor Flav, whose jokey ad-libbing and zany presence offset the group's seriousness. In many ways, Flavor Flav's role as ""hype man,"" or sidekick, helped Public Enemy's message spread by broadening the group's appeal.
The disagreement erupted over a Sunday campaign rally in Los Angeles and a performance by Public Enemy Radio, a recent offshoot of Public Enemy that doesn't include Flav. Two days before, Flavor Flav's attorney, Matthew Friedman, issued a cease-and-desist letter to the Sanders campaign, citing the use of Flavor Flav's likeness—and his trademark clock—in promotional materials.
""While Chuck is certainly free to express his political views as he sees fit, his voice alone does not speak for Public Enemy,"" Flav's lawyer said in the letter. In a handwritten note at the bottom of his attorney's letter, Flavor Flav said: ""Hey Bernie, don't do this.""
Chuck D fired back in a response to music-news outlets. ""Flavor chooses to dance for his money and not do benevolent work like this. He has a year to get his act together and get himself straight or he's out.""

Chuck D or Flavor Flav? Join the conversation below.
Then, right before the Los Angeles rally, Public Enemy issued a written statement that sounded like something that could have come from the White House, saying Flavor Flav was out of Public Enemy altogether. ""We thank him for his years of service,"" the statement said. Public Enemy Radio will be releasing a new album in April.
On Twitter, Chuck D further clarified that the Los Angeles rally wasn't the only cause. ""My last straw was long ago,"" he said. ""It's not about BERNIE and Flav…he don't know the difference between [former NFL running back] Barry Sanders or Bernie Sanders. He don't know either.""
He said Flavor Flav had refused to support other political activities, too. ""If there was a $bag, Flav would've been there front & center. He will NOT do free benefit shows.""
Flavor Flav's attorney responded: ""Flav's willingness to lend his efforts and platform to issues he believes in cannot be questioned,"" and that his only beef was with the marketing. Representatives for the Sanders campaign, Public Enemy and Chuck D couldn't be reached.
Jorge Maestre, 47, who grew up in New York City in the 1980s, says Public Enemy's social mission has been core to their reputation.
""Hip-hop, to that point, was fun, it was braggadocios. [Public Enemy] were the first ones to say, 'Hey, there is more.' "" Flavor Flav's recent projects, including ""Flavor of Love,"" a reality-TV show, suggest he was veering away from the group, says Mr. Maestre, who works in the technology industry.
When he heard the news, ""my immediate reaction was, 'This is long overdue.' ""
Judy Branfman, a 68-year-old filmmaker and activist who attended the Sunday event, says she is not a big follower of Public Enemy or Public Enemy Radio, but she ""loved their message last night for us all to get off our butts,"" adding that the act said this a bit differently.
Ari Melber is the host of ""The Beat with Ari Melber,"" an MSNBC show that covers news, politics and culture and often peppers in hip-hop references. When it comes to politics and music, he said, the bigger question is how much music can galvanize supporters.
As Public Enemy put it, he said, this is ""harder than you think.""

Voters head to the caucuses Saturday in Nevada, where the few recent polls show Sen. Bernie Sanders as the favorite, followed by other top candidates vying for second place.
Here's a guide to the race and our planned coverage.
When Are the Nevada Caucuses?
The caucuses are being held Saturday, Feb. 22, at more than 250 locations across the state; check-in starts at 10 a.m. PST (1 p.m. EST), and proceedings are called to order at noon. Results could start to become available within a few hours. In 2016, the Associated Press called the race for Hillary Clinton shortly after 5 p.m. EST.
For the first time,
Nevada this year allowed
several days of early voting, in which voters submitted a preference card indicating their top three to five choices for the Democratic nomination; also, a new law approved by the Democratic-controlled state legislature and signed by the governor allows ex-felons to vote. Another interesting fact: Voters can register or change party the day of the caucuses, if desired.
Why Is Nevada Important?
Nevada is more diverse than the first two nominating states of Iowa and New Hampshire, with a large Latino population testing the broader appeal of the Democratic candidates. Nevada has 36 Democratic delegates up for grabs, and a win there could solidify a candidate as a front-runner—or as an also-ran. The GOP isn't holding presidential caucuses in Nevada this election cycle.
How Do the Caucuses Work?

Caucuses are different
from primaries, in which voters mark a ballot and leave. In caucuses, they stand up for the candidate they support. As in Iowa, in Nevada, there are two rounds of voting and candidates must reach the 15% threshold to be viable. After the first round, caucus participants who supported a nonviable candidate can choose to join the campaign of a still-viable candidate or pool together with the untethered supporters of another nonviable candidate to try to reach the 15% threshold. Organizers will make a second and final count of all votes, again including early votes.
How Does the Democratic Race Stand Now?
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg emerged as the
leading contenders after Iowa and New Hampshire
. But Nevada's contest, which features a large Latino electorate, and South Carolina's, the first with a large African-American voting population, will test whether Messrs. Sanders and Buttigieg can appeal to a more diverse electorate. Sen. Sanders has taken
sole possession of the lead nationally
, a new WSJ/NBC News poll found, with four candidates essentially tied for second place amid declining support for former Vice President Joe Biden. With several contenders vowing to stay in the race for the White House, party leaders are again bracing for the likelihood of a protracted fight for the nomination.
Three Key Things to Watch For
Counting the votes. Nevada's Democratic Party will use iPads, Google web forms and telephone hotlines to report results, a process devised in the 10 days since the party ditched an app similar to the one that caused problems in Iowa. Nevada also faces the other challenge that plagued Iowa—for the first time, the state has to report three sets of results Saturday: first alignment of voters, a final vote total (after realignment and the elimination of candidates not reaching the 15% viability threshold) and a county convention delegate number, which is the metric the state party says is the most important.
Sanders's strength. Mr. Sanders could be hurt by a recent dust-up with the powerful Culinary Workers Union, which has criticized his Medicare for All plan and said it would eliminate health benefits for which members have bargained. The union said some of Mr. Sanders's supporters harassed labor leaders over the disagreement,
prompting the senator to say
during the debate Wednesday in Las Vegas, ""I disown those people; they are not part of our movement.""
Sorting out the field. Mr. Buttigieg needs to prove in Nevada that he can win nonwhite voters following strong finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota faces a similar challenge after she finished fifth in Iowa and third in New Hampshire. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is hoping a strong debate performance earlier this week could provide a new spark. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on his campaign, isn't competing in Nevada.

While some Democrats are nervous about Sen. Bernie Sanders capturing the Democratic presidential nomination, he cites polls suggesting he can beat President Trump in November. PHOTO: Victor J. Blue for The Wall Street Journal
MYRTLE BEACH, S.C.—Some Democrats in Southern states from North Carolina to Florida are anxious about Bernie Sanders winning the Democratic presidential nomination, saying it could jeopardize a closely-won governor's seat, reverse recent gains in state legislatures and turn what might be competitive congressional races into GOP landslides.
South Carolina House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford said Mr. Sanders, who has
surged to the top of the national polls
in the Democratic presidential primary, would bomb with South Carolina Democrats, including the socially and fiscally moderate constituents in his predominantly African-American district that includes Columbia.
Mr. Rutherford recently endorsed Democratic candidate Michael Bloomberg, even though the former New York mayor isn't on the ballot in Saturday's primary. He said he wanted to send up a flare that Democrats need resources and momentum to derail a Sanders nomination and beat President Trump.
""How do we explain to our people what democratic socialism is when we don't even know?"" Mr. Rutherford said, referring to Mr. Sanders's self-described ideology. ""It would be a bloodbath.""
At a Wednesday rally of 2,800 people in this fast-growing retiree mecca, Mr. Sanders said his critics were ignoring nearly 50 national polls that show he is the Democratic candidate who would beat Mr. Trump.

""We are putting together the strongest grass roots movement we've seen in a long time,"" he said, to cheers. ""We are beating Trump because our agenda is the agenda of the working families of this country.""
State Rep. Justin Bamberg, a longtime Sanders backer who represents a rural district in the central part of South Carolina, said Mr. Sanders would bring voters to the polls, which he said will help other Democrats on the ballot. To say otherwise is a scare tactic, he said.
""If you can't beat him straight up, you play Jenga with him, and try to undermine him,"" he said. ""It's not gonna work.""
Across the border in North Carolina, Mr. Sanders's ascendancy sent some leading Democrats from supporting former Vice President Joe Biden to rallying behind Mr. Bloomberg.
At a recent Bloomberg rally in Raleigh, Senate Minority Leader Dan Blue said a far-left candidate like Mr. Sanders would lose big in a state nearly evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, where President Obama won in 2008 and lost in 2012.
A loss at the top of the ticket could jeopardize Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's re-election chances as well as Democrats' prospects of gaining seats in the GOP-led legislature, said Mr. Blue, who in his previous role was the first African-American speaker of the state House. Mr. Cooper won the governor's chair in 2016 by roughly 10,000 votes—out of more than 5 million cast.
Democrats won enough seats in 2018 to break a GOP supermajority in the North Carolina House, and they picked up seats in the Senate, making it easier to advocate for increased teacher pay and other Democratic priorities, Mr. Blue said. Maintaining or adding to their ranks is critical in 2020 because of the coming round of redistricting and the possibility of approving Medicaid expansion, he said.
""Who we nominate matters for our country, but it also matters for our state races,"" Mr. Blue said. ""Beating Trump is one thing, but after that, we have a lot of problems to solve.""
Tommy Hendrickson, a former Democratic state chairman and longtime fundraiser who co-hosted an event in October for Mr. Biden, shifted his support to Mr. Bloomberg in mid-February.
""If we nominate Bernie, everybody's vulnerable,"" he said. ""Bernie for us is the equivalent of (George) McGovern,"" the liberal Democratic senator who lost 49 states in 1972 to GOP President Nixon.
Mr. Bloomberg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is also running for the Democratic nomination, are the advertised headliners for a Saturday rally in Charlotte hosted by the North Carolina Democratic Party, with Mr. Cooper and Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez expected to attend. The state's primary is on Super Tuesday, March 3. The state party said it invited all Democratic candidates, including Mr. Sanders.

What would a winning strategy for moderate Democrats look like? Join the conversation below.
Earlier this week, Florida Democrats fretted over Mr. Sanders's potential alienation of constituencies like Cuban-Americans and Jewish voters, with
his characterization of the late Fidel Castro's education policie
s in Cuba and his stated refusal to attend the annual conference of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee. The Florida Democratic Party issued a statement noting that party members ""need to understand our immigrant communities' shared stories.""
In South Carolina, Democratic leader Mr. Rutherford said a Sanders nomination would wipe out the hope of picking up seats in fast-growing places, including suburbs of Charlotte that are just south of the state line.
At a luncheon this week for House Democrats, Mr. Rutherford said a Sanders nomination would, at best, let him hold his 44 seats in the House to Republicans' 80. Forget about gains, he said, or holding on to Democrats' newly won Charleston congressional seat.
""With Bernie, you're only competitive where you already are,"" he said. ""In districts that could swing the other way, we all lose.""

Bernie Sanders concedes he is currently losing the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination. But the
Vermont senator is staying in the fight
to try to win a bigger war: his lifelong crusade to push the party's economic agenda further to the left.
The
candidate wants to dramatically expand government
in order to address ""the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality in this country,"" as he put it Wednesday.
Mr. Sanders's uncompromising adherence to his liberal ideals has been both his strength and weakness in this campaign. It energizes his core supporters, who favor his purity over more flexible rivals. But it has also turned off

Democrats who dislike his ideas or worry they are unrealistic
, and that his stubbornness would keep him from the give-and-take necessary to accomplish change in Washington. As Mr. Sanders himself has acknowledged, many also worry that his far-left position could make it hard to draw enough voters to beat President Trump in a general election. The escalating coronavirus crisis might also make Americans more risk-averse when choosing a leader.
Mr. Sanders argues that voters agree with his platform, even if they are skeptical of his candidacy. ""Poll after poll…shows that a strong majority of the American people support our progressive agenda,"" he said, in explaining why he would continue his
campaign against front-runner Joe Biden
, despite two straight weeks of big primary losses and mounting calls for him to drop out and unify the party against Mr. Trump.
He vowed to use this Sunday's debate, the first solely between the two candidates, to press his rival for detailed plans for expanding health care, reducing childhood poverty and curbing the political power of billionaires. The candidates face primaries on Tuesday in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio.
Mr. Sanders's bid to
remake Democratic economic thinking
remains one of the most intense conflicts in this election cycle, pitting him against affluent party donors and longtime policy makers who share many of his general goals, but prefer a less government-oriented, or more tempered approach.
Surveys indicate a party electorate torn. A February Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed 53% of Democratic voters preferred a candidate pushing Sanders-like ""larger scale policies that might cost more"" and ""bring major change,"" versus 41% favoring a Biden-like candidate ""who proposes smaller scale policies that…will bring less change.""
But the same poll found Democrats, by 53% to 42%, favored a candidate ""with the best chance to defeat Donald Trump"" over one ""closest to your views""—and they have increasingly concluded Mr. Biden has the best chance.
When Mr. Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, appeared ascendant last month in the nominating contest, his sweeping platform of national health care, universal free college and a Green New Deal drew blistering criticism from Democratic stalwarts.
Harvard economist Lawrence Summers, a top adviser to both Presidents Clinton and Obama, predicted ""major adverse consequences"" for workers, markets and business investment should Mr. Sanders prevail. Former Obama White House chief economist Jason Furman, also now at Harvard, said the Sanders program would lead to ""too many individuals too constrained from choices"" and ""a weaker economy."" The Progressive Policy Institute, a Washington center-left think tank, branded the Sanders platform ""fiscal fantasy.""
None of that moved Mr. Sanders to soften his policies. Instead, Mr. Sanders and his aides have blasted the criticism and the critics as tainted and out of touch. They blame moderate Democratic economists and think tanks, as much as Republicans, for long-term wage stagnation and other economic worries still haunting millions of Americans despite the long expansion.
""We need to think outside the box,"" said Warren Gunnels, Mr. Sanders's longtime policy adviser. ""Over the past 45 years we've seen a massive increase in income and wealth inequality while the working class continues to struggle. It's too late for establishment economics.""
Mr. Sanders is more likely to discuss fostering a ""moral economy"" than strategies to boost gross domestic product, business investment or corporate profits. With his ""economic bill of rights,"" he wants Washington to guarantee all Americans a job, health insurance, college and housing.
Many Democratic economists ""would argue those are fine aspirations, but in order to achieve them, you'd have to intervene in markets beyond levels they're comfortable with,"" said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the chief economist in the Obama administration for then-Vice President Biden.
Mr.
Sanders proposes sharply higher taxes
, bigger government spending and more regulation. He would boost the size of the federal government's share of GDP to a level exceeded only once, during World War II.
While many Democrats over the past few decades have tried to balance government intervention with market forces, Mr. Sanders has less trust in the power of markets to improve lives. On Thursday, he said his big-government vision of a national health-care plan and price controls on drug companies would put the country on stronger footing to address crises such as the coronavirus pandemic.
At times, he has dismissed cost concerns outright. Asked at a Feb. 18 CNN Las Vegas town hall about the price and feasibility of his plan to phase out fossil fuels, he replied: ""You tell me how much is too much if we're talking about saving this planet.""
Mr. Sanders wants to smash the conventional wisdom that he says has constrained thinking in Washington since Ronald Reagan—a consensus that treats higher taxes and new government programs with suspicion—and reopen discussion of liberal ideas that haven't been seriously considered since the 1970s.
The candidate already claims victory on that front, recounting how proposals from his failed 2016 bid, dismissed at the time as too far left, have since been embraced by Democratic party leaders.
One fight with Hillary Clinton, who won the 2016 Democratic nomination, was over his push to double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. The Democratic-led House last year passed a bill seeking to make that law, while all his 2020 rival candidates endorsed the goal. Mr. Sanders's 2016 proposal for a Wall Street tax on certain financial transactions was also embraced by much of the 2020 field. Mr. Biden's current positions on many issues, such as expanding the Social Security and Medicare entitlement programs, have moved him closer to Mr. Sanders than the longtime Delaware politician has been for much of his career.
""I have been called radical and extreme,"" Mr. Sanders said during an Iowa campaign stop last year. ""Over the last four years…a whole lot of other people have become radical and extreme.""
Even some mainstream center-left economists praise Mr. Sanders's bid to shake up the Washington consensus on restricting spending. ""All upper-income democracies in the world have much more generous welfare states than the U.S. and do fine,"" said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank that has long advised both Republican and Democratic administrations. ""We've gone so far off the rails in terms of underinvestment in the public sphere that even a massive shift would only get us part way to where we should be,"" Mr. Posen said.
The Sanders campaign has been the only major one in this election cycle to avoid even talking to top advisers of previous Democratic presidents. Economists who weren't part of the Clinton or Obama administrations have been close to the Sanders campaign. One is
Stephanie Kelton, a professor at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, N.Y., who served as an aide to Mr. Sanders on the Senate Budget Committee
. She is the leading proponent of ""modern monetary theory,"" which argues that governments shouldn't fret over debt and deficits.
Another is
Darrick Hamilton of Ohio State University, whose work focuses on what he calls ""economic justice."" He aims to narrow the wealth gap between black and white households
and has been a proponent of the federal job guarantee idea that Mr. Sanders has endorsed.
Mr.
Sanders's wealth tax
was written with the help of two French economists at the University of California, Berkeley, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren had a similar plan influenced by their work. Until she dropped out in early March, she was Mr. Sanders's competitor for the liberal lane in the nominating contest.
The Progressive Policy Institute estimates that Mr. Sanders is proposing adding just over $50 trillion in spending over 10 years, nearly doubling the federal government's current outlays. The new funds would mainly be used to expand the social safety net and to increase infrastructure spending.
That is more than eight times the spending proposed by Mr. Biden, and about 40% more than what Ms. Warren had proposed, according to PPI estimates.
Mr. Sanders would boost taxes by more than $20 trillion over 10 years, according to PPI, through increases in income, payroll and corporate taxes, as well as the new wealth tax. That could increase revenues collected under current policies by about half. That is about the same as Ms. Warren had planned but is six times the tax hikes laid out by Mr. Biden.
Most mainstream economists say spending and taxes on that scale would so distort the economy and private-sector activity that it would undermine growth. They warn that significantly higher tax rates could damp incentives for businesses and individuals to invest, while bigger payouts to households could curb incentives to work. They add that attempts by regulators to override market outcomes can impose costly inefficiencies in affected industries.

Has Bernie Sanders changed the economic agenda of the Democratic Party? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Gunnels, the Sanders aide, dismissed concerns about boosting the size of government. ""If we were a poor country…these would be legitimate questions,"" he said. ""We're not living in a Third World country. It's not too much to ask that everybody in this country has a decent standard of living.""
Sanders allies said his platform has successful 20th-century parallels: Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1930s New Deal, which created Social Security and a raft of new government programs and regulations; and Lyndon B. Johnson's 1960s Great Society, which created Medicare and new antipoverty initiatives.
Harvard's Mr. Summers said the scale of Mr. Sanders's proposals would far exceed anything FDR or LBJ enacted, or even what South Dakota Democratic Sen. George McGovern proposed during his 1972 landslide loss to Richard Nixon, a defeat that helped usher in the party's retreat from liberalism.
If Mr. Sanders were able to enact his full program, government as a share of GDP would jump from the 2017 level of about 38%, one of the lowest levels in the developed world, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, to more than 50%. That is well above any peacetime level in U.S. history, but in line with European countries such as France and Denmark.
Mr. Sanders and his supporters have embraced the European model—in 2016, in response to gibes he wanted ""America to look more like Scandinavia,"" he replied, ""What's wrong with that?""
He also envisions
a raft of new government regulations
, from national rent control to new rules for CEO pay to an outright ban on fracking.
While some Democratic economists prefer to address climate change with market incentives, such as a carbon tax, Mr. Sanders would rely more on direct government orders. To protect energy workers who might lose their jobs as Mr. Sanders moved to phase out fossil fuels, he promises five years of government-guaranteed salary, plus housing assistance, pension support and retirement subsidies for those who decide not to continue working.
That ""would be an utter nightmare to enforce,"" said Dean Baker, an economist at the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, saying it would be difficult to flesh out the criteria for who exactly would qualify. ""What about the person who works for the supplier to an oil company? What about the person who lost his job one month before the Green New Deal? It's quite hard to do these things as a practical matter.""
Mr. Sanders would aim to shrink the role of the financial sector in the economy by, among other things, breaking up the largest banks, and reimposing Depression-era limits on banking activity.
He would make it harder for employers to fire workers, unionized or not, and would require big companies to give workers shares of company stock and the right to choose nearly half the seats on corporate boards. His goal is to recalibrate the balance of power between corporations and unions, who have seen their clout erode steadily over the past 40 years.
""In Bernie Sanders's world, the market doesn't come from a state of nature, it comes out of an allocation of power,"" said Robert Reich, a Berkeley public policy professor, who served as President Clinton's labor secretary and has periodically defended Mr. Sanders against attacks from other academics. ""The standard economic view is that the market is filled with potential win-win opportunities, but when you're talking about power, it's more complicated. Some people gain it and others lose it.""

Sen. Bernie Sanders, facing a shrinking path to the Democratic presidential nomination, made a case for continuing in the 2020 race as front-running rival Joe Biden sought to unite the party behind his candidacy.
Mr. Sanders said on Wednesday he intended to participate in a scheduled debate Sunday in Phoenix, where he said he would press the former vice president to move in a more liberal policy direction on issues such as health care and college affordability. The senator from Vermont also offered a frank assessment of his chances a day after Mr. Biden strengthened his bid for the nomination with victories in Tuesday's contests, most notably a blowout in Michigan.
The previous evening ""was not a good night for our campaign,"" Mr. Sanders said in Burlington, Vt. He said his campaign often hears on the trail that voters see Mr. Biden as a better bet against President Trump in November, even as some of Mr. Sanders's progressive policy ideas are popular among Democrats.
""While our campaign has won the ideological debate, we are losing the debate over electability,"" Mr. Sanders said.
Mr. Biden won in Michigan by 17 percentage points over Mr. Sanders, and he also scored victories in Missouri, Mississippi and Idaho with a coalition of African-Americans, suburbanites and older voters. It was a further sign of Mr. Biden's surge in a matter of weeks from a candidate who appeared headed for a third failed presidential bid to the delegate leader and front-runner. The wins also prompted calls from inside the party to unite around his candidacy and direct its full attention to defeating Mr. Trump, a Republican.
""Last night, Joe Biden expanded his coalition and continues to demonstrate he is the candidate who can unite the Democratic Party,"" T.J. Ducklo, a Biden campaign spokesman, said Wednesday.
The former vice president's turnaround has reordered the contest for the Democratic nomination over the past few weeks and put pressure on Mr. Sanders to prove he has a viable path forward.
On Wednesday morning, Mr. Sanders was declared the winner in North Dakota, while the candidates were locked in a tight race in Washington state.
Tad Devine, the chief strategist of Mr. Sanders's 2016 campaign who most recently helped the presidential campaign of Andrew Yang, said in an interview he didn't see ""a realistic pathway to the nomination"" for Mr. Sanders.
""The question he has to confront this time, which was not on the play last time, is: Are you going to enable another four years of Donald Trump by participating in this process longer? And are you going to handicap Biden's ability to defeat Trump? That's a very big issue,"" said Mr. Devine, who noted he hadn't spoken to the senator since the last presidential bid.
Mr. Biden addressed the senator's supporters Tuesday evening as he sought to position himself as the candidate the party could rally around.
""I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion,"" Mr. Biden said in Philadelphia. ""We share a common goal and together, we'll defeat Donald Trump. We'll defeat him together.""
Encouraged by Tuesday's results, Mr. Biden's allies began making plans for a monthslong battle against Mr. Trump.
Unite the Country, a pro-Biden super PAC, said in a memo to supporters that ""the functional primary phase of this election is over.""
The group said it had raised nearly $10 million, ""with triple that in commitments,"" during the past 10 days.
Mr. Biden's strong performance, after winning 10 states a week ago on Super Tuesday, also spurred two deep-pocketed liberal groups to get behind him and say the general-election campaign against Mr. Trump was starting. Priorities USA and American Bridge had remained neutral throughout the primary.
With those groups lining up behind Mr. Biden, Sunday's debate took on more importance as it will be the first time the two men will go head-to-head.
Rep. Tim Ryan (D., Ohio), a Biden supporter, said on CNN that he would welcome a debate of ideas this weekend but cautioned that Mr. Sanders shouldn't use the opportunity to tear down Mr. Biden.
""I think at this point, trashing each other is not in the best interest of, not just the Democratic Party, but bringing some unity to this country,"" he said.
Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said Wednesday on CNN that the campaign wouldn't tell Mr. Sanders what to do. Instead, she made an appeal to his supporters and young voters.
""I think there is a tremendous amount that we agree on, and I would say to Bernie Sanders supporters that if they're looking for a home, they've got one with Joe Biden,"" Ms. Bedingfield said.
Mr. Biden's edge over Mr. Sanders in convention delegates was 861 to 710 Wednesday afternoon, according to a Wall Street Journal tracker. The Biden campaign suggested in a memo Wednesday night that it may have a lead of more than 300 delegates over Mr. Sanders after next week's primaries in four states.
""Should our broad base of support remain. . .it will be nearly impossible for Sanders to recoup his current delegate disadvantage,"" the campaign said. The Sanders campaign didn't respond to the memo.
The campaigns have competed for votes against the backdrop of growing concerns over the spread of the coronavirus. Both candidates have questioned Mr. Trump's handling of the crisis, and on Tuesday they each canceled rallies in Cleveland.

Seven Democratic presidential candidates
took the stage
in New Hampshire on Friday night, days ahead of the state's the first-in-the-nation primary next week.
The top finishers in the
Iowa caucuses
this week, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg drew the most attention from their rivals. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose Iowa results fell short of what they'd hoped, tried to make their case to voters across the country. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, billionaire climate activist Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang also shared the debate stage. The candidates squared off over experience and who was best suited to take on President Donald Trump in the general election.
Pete Buttigieg was in opponents' crosshairs.
""We have a newcomer in the White House, and look where it got us.""—Amy Klobuchar
Why this matters: Ms. Klobuchar was citing President Trump's political novelty as she hit Pete Buttigieg over his inexperience compared with the other top Democratic contenders. Ms. Klobuchar and Joe Biden trained their ire on Mr. Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Ind., who appears to have tied with Mr. Sanders to win the Iowa caucuses this week. The trio of more moderate candidates are vying for independents in New Hampshire and center-left Democrats across the country.
As she warned that the country shouldn't take another risk on a political newcomer, Ms. Klobuchar also chided Mr. Buttigieg, ""Mayor Pete, while three of us were jurors in the impeachment hearing, you said you wanted to turn the channel and watch cartoons. It's easy to go after Washington. It's much harder to lead.""
Mr. Buttigieg responded to those kinds of attacks by contrasting himself to the third-term Minnesota senator and Mr. Biden, a senator and vice president for 4½ decades. ""We cannot solve the problems before us by looking back,"" Mr. Buttigieg said.
Bernie Sanders pressed on identifying as a ""democratic socialist.""
""Bernie said he wrote the damn bill, but didn't say how he'll pay for the damn thing.""—Joe Biden
Why this matters: Mr. Biden hammered Mr. Sanders over his refusal to talk about how he would fund his Medicare for All plan. The candidates opened the three-hour debate with a discussion of their health care plans—and immediately showed more willingness to confront each other than in past debates. Early on, a moderator asked the candidates to raise their hands if they thought having a democratic socialist at the top of the ticket was a problem. Ms. Klobuchar appeared to be the only candidate on the stage to do so.
Earlier, Mr. Biden had said that Mr. Trump would apply the label socialist to ""everyone running with Bernie if he's the nominee."" Mr. Sanders responded to such criticism by saying Mr. Trump lies about everything, so it doesn't matter what people worry he might say. He also argued he could bring broad swaths of Americans together by rallying them around more affordable health care and decrying income inequality.
Michael Bloomberg looms large despite not being on stage.
""I don't think anyone ought to be able to buy their way into the nomination or being president of the United States.""—Elizabeth Warren
Why this matters: The debate moderators asked the candidates on stage what they thought about billionaire former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg's self-financed effort to win the Democratic nomination despite sitting out the first four primary contests. Mr. Bloomberg hasn't qualified for any of the debates so far, but the Democratic National Committee recently changed its criteria in such a way that he could be on future stages.
Ms. Klobuchar cited her working-class upbringing and spouted another Trump-themed zinger. ""I don't think people look at the guy in the White House and think, 'Can we get someone richer?'""
A moderator baited Mr. Sanders on the topic by saying the former mayor had said ""we need evolution, not revolution,"" a riff on Mr. Sanders's campaign theme. Mr. Sanders called it ""nonsense"" that Mr. Bloomberg can spend hundreds of millions of dollars on his own campaign, and plugged his 1.5 million donors who had given an average of just over $18 each.
Candidates wrestle with abortion and the Supreme Court.
""I will never nominate any person to the Supreme Court or the federal courts in general who is not 100% pro Roe V. Wade.""—Bernie Sanders
Why This Matters: Other candidates on stage gave sometimes meandering answers to a question about whether they would only nominate Supreme Court judges who would keep abortion legal. ""I would only appoint judges that would respect precedent. And one of those key precedents is Roe v. Wade,"" Ms. Klobuchar said. Mr. Biden gave a lengthy answer about the kinds of justices he had backed in the past.
Mr. Sanders said that he would only nominate justices fully supportive of upholding Roe v. Wade, referring to the 1973 court decision that legalized abortion. Billionaire Tom Steyer said he, too, has a litmus test and argued that all of the candidates were in agreement. ""Everybody on this row feels exactly the same way about a woman's right to choose,"" he said.
Candidates forced to disavow their own surrogates
""I believe he's sorry for what he said.""—Joe Biden
Why this matters: Mr. Steyer confronted Mr. Biden over a remark that his longtime friend and campaign surrogate in South Carolina Dick Harpootlian made. Mr. Harpootlian, a Democratic state senator, said the head of the state's black legislative caucus only backed Mr. Steyer because he was paid to do so, something other black lawmakers decried as a racist remark. Mr. Harpootlian denies that his comment was racially motivated, according to the Associated Press, and on the debate stage, Mr. Biden said he'd spoken to Mr. Harpootlian and believed he was sorry.
Soon after, a debate moderator asked Mr. Sanders about an opinion piece his campaign co-chair Nina Turner wrote asserting that Mr. Biden has ""repeatedly betrayed black voters."" Mr. Sanders said he did not agree with Ms. Turner's assessment. ""Joe Biden is a friend of mine, and I'm not here to attack him,"" he said.

If history is any guide, the 2020 election year may not bode well for stocks in the health-care or technology sectors.
But the S&P 500 as a whole may do just fine.
The health-care and technology segments of the S&P 500 typically suffer their worst performance of the four-year election cycle during the years Americans go to the polls to name a president.
That is according to an analysis of sector performance by Dow Jones Market Data going back to 1928, the year in which Republican Herbert Hoover won the presidency by defeating Democrat Al Smith.
The broader market, on the other hand, has averaged its best performance in the year before elections, followed by the year in which voters pick a new occupant for the White House.
This year, the outlook for stocks is bolstered by an economy that is marching along as well as by recent progress on trade agreements, said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group.
""That should clear the decks for markets to do quite well throughout this year,"" he said.
Last year's standout S&P 500 advance of 29% -- its best showing since 2013 -- fit the historical trend and beat the average gain of 13.5% in pre-election years. Investment-bank strategists expect more modest results in 2020. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., for one, predicts the index will end the year at 3400, which would mark a 5.2% rise. Its average gain in election years is 9.1%.
As far as the historical election-year laggards: The health-care sector has received particular attention from investors during the current presidential campaign, with some Democratic candidates proposing major changes to how Americans get health insurance.
Bernie Sanders has proposed a Medicare-for-All plan that would move every American to a government-run health-insurance plan, even if they have insurance through their employer. Elizabeth Warren has endorsed a similar approach.
Although health-care stocks often are considered defensive investments -- demand for health care doesn't generally fluctuate with the economy -- they can be vulnerable to changes in government policy.
Health-care stocks were the next-to-worst performing sector in the S&P 500 in 2019, after energy. Some analysts pegged their trajectory to the progressive Democrats' rise and fall in the polls. So far in 2020, the shares are slightly underperforming the broader market, rising 2.5% versus a gain of 2.8% by the S&P 500. Their average gain in election years is 7.9%
Technology stocks, on the other hand, had a standout year in 2019, surging 48%. They continue to lead the S&P 500 in 2020, with a gain of 5.8% -- slightly ahead of the average increase of 5% in election years.
Shares of technology companies have powered the decadelong bull market, with investors putting their money behind rapidly growing enterprises that many expect will outperform the broader economy. That is even as big tech companies face antitrust probes and controversies over their handling of user data.
Those concerns, combined with the relative priciness of technology stocks, could pose risks for the sector in 2020, Mr. Cox said.
""It could be this year tech is beaten up by candidates more than health care,"" he said.
In contrast, three sectors have had their best average performance in presidential-election years: financials, utilities and energy. Those are generally considered slower-growing companies. Financial and energy shares are often categorized as value stocks, or those with a low price-to-book value, while utilities are deemed safety stocks because of their high dividend yields.
DJMD's sector analysis excludes returns from 2008, when the S&P 500 suffered an outsize decline of 38% in the depths of the financial crisis. When including performance from that year, seven of the 11 sectors in the index average their weakest performance during presidential-election years.

When the going gets tough, Bernie Sanders's aides talk about what happened on Oct. 4.
That was the day the Vermont senator left the hospital after a heart attack, just after the lowest point in his presidential bid, and a reminder that the campaign has proven it can turn things around.
This week, after chaotic results out of the Iowa Democratic Party and no clear answer about who won the state's presidential caucuses, aides acknowledged frustration. So the campaign sought to reset ahead of next week's New Hampshire primary, declaring victory in Iowa while results were still coming in and disclosing massive January fundraising.
Mr. Sanders had a lead in the popular vote with 97% of precincts reporting as of Thursday. But he and former South Bend Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg were locked in a tight race for the metric that Iowa Democrats consider most important, so-called state delegate equivalents.
On Thursday, the Associated Press said it would be unable to declare a winner in the contest, citing the close margin between Messrs. Buttigieg and Sanders as well as ""irregularities in this year's caucus process.""
And the chairman of the Democratic Party called for a recanvass—the auditing of paper records from each precinct's caucus—after technical problems marred the tabulation of results.
""Where I come from and where everybody else comes from, the person who gets the most votes wins,"" Mr. Sanders said during a press conference in Manchester, N.H. ""We got the most votes.""
In interviews, Mr. Sanders's top aides said they plan to stick with their strategy of appealing to young people and minorities, saying the candidate did well in Iowa precincts with large populations of those groups. On Thursday,
the campaign announced it received $25 million from grass-roots donors in January
—more than many candidates raised in entire quarters last year—and said it is investing $5.5 million in advertising in 10 states set to vote in late February and early March.
Mr. Sanders has been leading in polls in New Hampshire, too.
""I am confident that here in New Hampshire, I know you'll be able to count your votes on election night,"" Mr. Sanders told a crowd in Milford, N.H., Tuesday night. ""And when you count those votes, I look forward to winning here in New Hampshire.""
The Iowa results carried some warning signs for Mr. Sanders.
The close race with Mr. Buttigieg
, a 38-year-old Washington outsider who has sought to appeal to moderates, reveals the Democratic Party remains ideologically divided and is still deciding what type of candidate should take on President Trump.
Some more centrist voters worry that Mr. Sanders—a self-described Democratic socialist—could scare off moderate Republicans and independent voters looking for an alternative to Mr. Trump. And Mr. Sanders could face difficulty expanding his base if the field narrows. His strategy to rack up delegates relies on a fractured Democrats field. If candidates were to drop out, early voters could coalesce around one of his opponents.
Share Your Thoughts
Are you awaiting the official results of Iowa's Democratic caucuses to help decide between candidates? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
The caucuses also saw lower-than-expected turnout, despite the Vermont senator's vow to expand the electorate.
Mr. Sanders narrowly lost the state in his long-shot bid for the Democratic nomination in 2016. This time, Mr. Sanders announced his run in February with strong name identification and a more experienced team.
To move ahead of a crowded field, the Sanders campaign invested in its ground game in Iowa. On Feb. 1, the campaign announced it had knocked on half a million doors since the beginning of January. As of Monday, the Sanders campaign had bought nearly $11 million worth of TV and radio advertisements in the state, trailing just businessman Tom Steyer, who spent over $16 million.
Jane O'Meara Sanders, Mr. Sanders's wife, also said campaigning in the final days before the caucuses felt different than it did four years ago.
""I felt that in 2016, we were introducing him at every venue, we were introducing Bernie Sanders to Iowa,"" Mrs. Sanders said in an interview the weekend before the Iowa caucuses.

While nine out of 10 people in Iowa are white, the Sanders campaign also
focused on increasing turnout from voters in minority communities
and sent organizers to talk with people in areas with large Latino populations, said Misty Rebik, his Iowa state director. Mr. Sanders also held an event on a Native American settlement in Iowa and focused on how his policies would affect those in attendance. Mr. Sanders and the rest of the field have struggled for the support of African-American voters, particularly older ones, who have flocked to former Vice President Joe Biden.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez met with Latinos on her trips to the state. Her decision to endorse the Vermont senator while he was still in the hospital last fall helped give a shot of energy to a lagging campaign, as did those of two other liberal congresswomen, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.).
All three were in Iowa for Mr. Sanders in the last two weeks, campaigning across the state as he was stuck in Washington for the impeachment trial of Mr. Trump.
Aides believe Mr. Sanders was able to consolidate support in the final weeks after voters looked at other candidates and compared them to Mr. Sanders, who has been calling for the same policies for decades.
Heather Purdy, a 45-year-old professor from Des Moines, said she had decided on Mr. Sanders the week before the caucuses. Ms. Purdy had been considering Mr. Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, but she said the Vermont lawmaker's consistency ultimately won her over. ""He's had the same platform for the last 40 years,"" she said.

Glitches to a mobile app and a backup phone-in plan for reporting results in Iowa's Democratic presidential caucuses delayed the outcome and heightened concerns about the integrity of the voting process in the 2020 elections.
After Monday night's failure, some Democratic Party officials in the 1,700-plus caucus sites complained about the rollout and difficulties in downloading and using the app. Some said a final version was only made available this past weekend. Still, others said that when they tried to phone results to party leaders, they were put on hold or disconnected.
The faulty kickoff led Democratic candidates to express frustration. Nevada's State Democratic Party, which holds its caucuses later this month, announced that it wouldn't use the app that malfunctioned in Iowa.
Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said the app ""did not function adequately"" and won't be used again in any future primary election contest.
The Iowa Democratic Party had been warned by security experts that the app hadn't been stress tested or vetted for statewide use. Bob Lord, the DNC's cybersecurity chief, also urged Iowa to drop plans to use the app, an overture that was ignored, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Lord declined to comment.
The Iowa Democratic Party chairman, Troy Price, said that no cyber intrusion occurred and that paper records ensure the data on results are accurate. While the data was collected accurately by the app, he said, an underlying coding error that affected how figures were reported was discovered and corrected.
""We took the steps we felt was necessary, but we found a coding error last night once we discovered some irregularities,"" Mr. Price said during an afternoon press conference held almost a full day after the caucuses began, shortly before partial results were released. Apologizing for the problems, Mr. Price promised a full, transparent investigation. ""What happened last night was simply unacceptable.""
The debacle in Iowa's first-in-the-nation nominating contest threatened to shake voter confidence in the electoral process at the start of the 2020 voting season, election and cybersecurity experts said.
""The big risk is that disruptions and uncertainty like this will be exploited to discourage people from voting,"" said Matt Blaze, an election security expert and professor of computer science at Georgetown University.
The app at the center of the controversy was built by a small Washington, D.C.-based company, Shadow Inc., the tech arm of a nonprofit progressive digital strategy firm Acronym. State records show that the Iowa Democratic Party paid Shadow a little more than $63,000 over two payments in November and December.
Shadow, in a series of tweets, apologized on Tuesday for the app's performance and said that the company ""worked as quickly as possible overnight to resolve this issue.""
Cybersecurity experts and U.S. election security officials said that while no hacking or other foul play had been detected, the app hadn't been security tested or vetted for statewide use—something Mr. Price disputed.
""Our Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency had offered to test the app,"" Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said Tuesday on ""Fox & Friends,"" the Fox network's flagship morning program. ""They declined."" Mr. Price said he wasn't aware of any offer.

Some Democratic campaigns, including those of former Vice President Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, have used a Shadow-built app to send text messages to supporters and solicit donations, according to federal campaign expense records and people familiar with the matter. The Biden campaign halted its use of that app amid concerns about its reliability.
""Our campaign used Shadow only once and on a very small scale, for sending text messages to voters about our campaign kickoff in Philadelphia,"" a Biden aide told The Wall Street Journal. ""Our IT team expressed security concerns about it, and it ultimately did not pass our cybersecurity checklist, so we declined to use it again.""
Election security became a priority for state officials, the political parties and the campaigns after the hacking of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman's email and divisive social media postings by what U.S. intelligence agencies say were Russian groups roiled the 2016 election.

In a partisan political atmosphere when elections are sometimes decided by thin margins, delays in reporting results may stoke doubt. Overhauls in many states still allow a lengthy period to complete and certify results; California, which moved its primary to early March from June, has 30 days from election day
to final certification
.
In Iowa, the confusion over the app fueled intraparty squabbling among Democrats. Supporters for Bernie Sanders, who had been leading in several polls, took to social media to revisit grievances from the 2016 election when hacked Democratic National Committee emails showed some bias by party officials in favor of Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Sanders.
Trump campaign officials also seemed to touch on Democratic divisions, questioning whether the app problems and the Iowa party's checking of the data were designed to favor a particular candidate. ""Quality control = rigged?"" tweeted Brad Parscale, manager for President Trump's re-election campaign.
Acronym distanced itself from Shadow, saying in statements that it is one of a number of investors in the company and that the two ""are distinct organizations, with separate teams of employees."" Acronym said it wasn't involved in the development of the app or in Shadow's work with the Iowa Democratic Party.
Last year, Acronym Chief Executive Tara McGowan said it was launching Shadow as part of an acquisition of a political customer-relationship management tool.
Acronym is led by Ms. McGowan, a Democratic political strategist, and has several related arms, including a political-action committee with a roughly $75 million advertising budget to target voters in swing states. She is married to a senior aide in Mr. Buttigieg's campaign, a connection that earned widespread attention on social media.
Mr. Buttigieg's campaign ""didn't have anything to do with the design of the app,"" a Buttigieg aide said, while adding the campaign's contract with the firm predates that of the Iowa Democratic Party.
Until Monday night, party officials declined to identify the app's developer. The office of Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) asked the Democratic National Committee three times about details regarding the app during the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses, but received no reply, an aide to the senator said.
Problems with the Shadow app surfaced Monday in Iowa before voting started, with some precinct leaders saying they had trouble downloading or logging onto the app. The Iowa Democratic Party said the reported issues were mainly from areas with poor cell service or involved minor user errors that were being resolved.
Some precinct officials in rural areas didn't know about the app until a few weeks ago, received no training and decided not to use it, said Tracy Freese, chair of the Democratic Party in Grundy County, who also serves as a precinct chair. She opted to call in results, as she did for previous caucuses.
Ms. Freese said she tried to get her results through on the hotline, but was put on hold and gave up after 12:30 a.m. She called back early this morning and didn't get someone on the phone until 6 a.m. Mr. Price, the Iowa Democratic Party chief, answered.
""I don't know what the hell is going on,"" she said.
The state party said last month that it would record votes from the Iowa caucuses using the smartphone app because that would be easier and faster to report results.
The app was intended to help the precinct chairs record the results from each round of voting and take care of the calculations to apportion delegates. Then the precinct chair was supposed to use the app to send the results to the Iowa Democratic Party.
But the final version wasn't ready until this past weekend, according to precinct chairs.
Joel Miller, county auditor and commissioner of elections in Cedar Rapids who volunteered to host his precinct's caucus, said he downloaded the final version of the app onto his iPhone on Saturday. When he did, he received a download link that took him to TestFlight, which is used to test new apps not ready to be shared via the Apple Store. Through TestFlight, Mr. Miller said he was able to access the vote reporting app.

CONCORD, N.H.—Sen. Bernie Sanders won the New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary Tuesday night in a narrow victory that ensures the race to challenge President Trump this November will remain heated.
With more than 85% of precincts reporting, Mr. Sanders, who is from neighboring Vermont, had 25.7% of the vote, followed by Pete Buttigieg with 24.4% and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota with 19.7%.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joe Biden, who each have previously led the Democratic field in national polling, lagged well behind with less than 10% of the vote.
""Let me say tonight that this victory here is the beginning of the end for Donald Trump,"" Mr. Sanders said to loud cheers at a watch party in Manchester. He also struck a tone of unity as he thanked his fellow candidates, who he said he respected.
""No matter who wins, and we certainly hope it's going to be us, we're going to unite together. We are going to unite together and defeat the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country,"" Mr. Sanders said.
The 78-year-old self-described democratic socialist
had expected a strong showing here
would propel him into contests in Nevada and South Carolina, two states where he lost to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential primary. That year, Mr. Sanders easily won in New Hampshire with more than 60% of the vote.
Mr. Sanders's win, following his near-tie with Mr. Buttigieg in last week's Iowa caucuses, showcased the resilience of a candidate who only months ago suffered a
heart attack while campaigning in Nevada
. The Associated Press called the New Hampshire primary for Mr. Sanders shortly after 11:40 p.m. EST.

The victory came as candidates seeking to challenge Mr. Trump began shifting focus to two more diverse states and to later primaries with big delegate hauls up for grabs. The race appeared likely to remain competitive until later contests provide more clarity.
Speaking to supporters in Nashua, Mr. Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Ind., congratulated Mr. Sanders, saying he had admired him when he was in high school and respected him now. He also thanked supporters who saw him as having crossover appeal for voters in the political middle.
""Thanks to you, a campaign that some said shouldn't be here at all, has shown that we are here to stay,"" Mr. Buttigieg said.
""So many of you decided that a middle-class mayor, a veteran from the industrial Midwest was the right choice to take on this president, not in spite of that experience, but because of it,"" he said.
While Tuesday was a second strong finish for Mr. Buttigieg, the race gets tougher after this. The former mayor hasn't been polling as well nationally or with minorities, whose support he will need to be successful in the next two contests.
Ms. Klobuchar, who came in fifth in Iowa but outperformed her polling and then had a
strong debate performance in New Hampshire
, now moves on to states on which she has put less emphasis. Her campaign on Tuesday rolled out a seven-figure TV ad buy in Nevada and plans to increase its footprint in that state and in states that will hold contests March 3, known as Super Tuesday.
Ms. Klobuchar pitched herself in remarks Tuesday evening in Concord as the candidate able to assemble a coalition of Democrats, independents and moderate Republicans.
""Hello, America, I'm Amy Klobuchar, and I will beat Donald Trump,"" she said. ""While there are still ballots to count, we have beaten the odds every step of the way.""
Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren lagged behind, each below 10% support Tuesday with not all votes counted. Both candidates had played down the significance of this state, with the former vice president leaving early to attend a campaign party in South Carolina.
Ms. Warren took the stage early at her election night event in Manchester and praised Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg for having ""strong nights."" She also congratulated Ms. Klobuchar ""for showing just how wrong the pundits can be when they count a woman out.""
The crowded Democratic field also narrowed as results were coming in, with Colorado Sen.
Michael Bennet
and entrepreneur
Andrew Yang
both ending their bids.
""The math just didn't work out,"" said Yang campaign manager Zach Graumann.
Though New Hampshire awards just 24 delegates to the Democratic National Convention—candidates need 1,990 to secure the nomination—the state, along with Iowa, can help candidates establish early momentum. Now after races in states that with largely white electorates, the candidates head to Nevada, which has sizable Hispanic and black populations, and South Carolina, where black voters wield considerable power in the state's Democratic primary.
Shortly after South Carolina's Feb. 29 primary will be Super Tuesday, in which the 16 contests will go a long way toward deciding the Democratic nominee.
Exit polls released by television networks indicated that nearly half—48%—of New Hampshire voters surveyed made their decision within the past few days, another indication of a dynamic electorate.
Mr. Biden, who for the past year has attracted the wide majority of support from black voters in polls, is banking on a strong showing in South Carolina to swing the race back his way going into Super Tuesday on March 3. He placed a disappointing fourth in Iowa despite leading in national polling for much of the past year.
Attempting to bypass the loss in New Hampshire, Mr. Biden told supporters in Columbia, S.C., that the country had only heard from two states so far.
""Where I come from, that's the opening bell, not the closing bell,"" Mr. Biden said. ""And the fight to end Donald Trump's presidency is just beginning.""
He pointed to the diversity of the electorate in coming states such as Nevada and South Carolina, noting that most of the nation's black and Latino voters had yet to cast a ballot.
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's impact on the race is also uncertain. He isn't competing in the states voting in February but has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in states that hold primaries in March and later.

Democratic presidential primary voters now overwhelmingly back Joe Biden over Bernie Sanders, a dramatic reversal in their standings of just one month ago, the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows.
Among those who have already voted or plan to do so, 61% support the former vice president, while 32% would prefer the Vermont senator as their party's nominee.
The standings are a major change from mid-February, when the survey showed Mr. Sanders backed by 27% of Democratic primary voters and Mr. Biden favored by just 15%.
At the time, Mr. Sanders stood alone as the party's front-runner, while Mr. Biden was among four candidates essentially tied for second place. But Mr. Biden's fortunes changed significantly following his win in South Carolina's Feb. 29 primary and dominance in a string of field-narrowing primaries since then.
The share of Democratic primary voters who say they have definitely settled on a candidate has skyrocketed in the past month, from 37% to 80%, giving Mr. Sanders little room for growth beyond his current base.
Moreover, the coronavirus pandemic, which has altered many aspects of the campaign, is making it harder for Mr. Sanders to break through with his message. It has also eliminated the large rallies that provide much of the fuel for his campaign.
""Bernie Sanders is on a cement trampoline -- not a lot of bounce,"" said Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who worked on the survey with Jeff Horwitt, also a Democrat, and Republican Bill McInturff.
""The race is sort of locked into place,"" said Mr. McInturff. ""This is very clear, definitive data about the status of this race and the things Bernie Sanders was unable to do to create a coalition.""
A televised debate set for Sunday night between the two Democratic candidates will compete for attention with news of the pandemic, which is producing dramatic headlines almost by the hour. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii), who drew 4% support in the poll, didn't meet Democratic National Committee criteria to qualify for the debate.
The race doesn't look more different among the half of Democrats who have yet to vote than among those who already have cast ballots. Mr. Biden leads by 63% to 30% among primary voters in states that have already held primaries or caucuses and by 60% to 34% in the states that haven't voted.
""There is no indication that this gets easier for Bernie Sanders in the remaining half of the vote,"" Mr. McInturff said.
The level of enthusiasm among Democratic primary voters for Mr. Biden has also grown in the past month. Some 74% feel enthusiastic about or comfortable with him, up from 56% in February. The share enthusiastic about or comfortable with Mr. Sanders has been stable, at about 66%.
Groups that have swung most dramatically behind Mr. Biden in the last month include African-Americans, among whom he leads by 77% to 18%, as well as liberals and voters who say they are ""strongly"" aligned with the Democratic Party. Mr. Biden leads by nearly three-to-one among that group.
Looking to the general election, Mr. Biden led President Trump in the new survey by 9 percentage points, 52% to 43%, in a test match-up, while Mr. Sanders led by 4 points, 49% to 45%. Both margins were essentially unchanged from February.
The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll was based on nationwide telephone interviews of 900 registered voters. It was conducted from March 11-13, 2020, by the polling organizations of Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies and Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates.
The sample was drawn in the following manner: Individuals were randomly selected from national lists of registered voters and were chosen by a systematic procedure to provide a balance of respondents by sex. Respondents reached on their cellphone were randomly selected from national lists of cellphone numbers.
Of the 900 interviews in the weighted data, 495 respondents were reached on a cellphone and screened to ensure that their cellphone was the only phone they had. In addition, 13 respondents were reached on a cellphone but reported also having a landline.
The margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus 3.27 percentage points. Additional interviews were conducted on some questions from a random national sample of Democratic primary voters. For the sample of 438 Democratic primary voters, the margin of error is plus or minus 4.68 percentage points.

Bernie Sanders concedes he is losing the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination. But the Vermont senator is still fighting a bigger war: his lifelong crusade to push the party's economic agenda to the left.
The candidate wants to dramatically expand government in order to address ""the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality in this country,"" as he put it Wednesday.
Mr. Sanders's uncompromising adherence to his liberal ideals has been both his strength and weakness in this campaign. It energizes his core supporters, who favor his purity over more flexible rivals. But it has also turned off Democrats who dislike his ideas or worry they are unrealistic, and that his stubbornness would keep him from the give-and-take necessary to accomplish change in Washington. As Mr. Sanders himself has acknowledged, many also worry that his far-left position could make it hard to draw enough voters to beat President Trump in a general election. The escalating coronavirus crisis might also make Americans more risk-averse in choosing a leader.
Mr. Sanders argues that voters agree with his platform, even if they are skeptical of his candidacy. ""Poll after poll . . . shows that a strong majority of the American people support our progressive agenda,"" he said, in explaining why he would continue his campaign against front-runner Joe Biden, despite two straight weeks of primary losses and calls for him to drop out and unify the party against Mr. Trump.
He vowed to use Sunday's debate, the first solely between the two candidates, to press his rival for detailed plans for expanding health care, reducing childhood poverty and curbing the political power of billionaires. The candidates face primaries on Tuesday in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio.
Mr. Sanders's bid to remake Democratic economic thinking remains one of the most intense conflicts in this election cycle, pitting him against affluent party donors and policy makers who share many of his general goals, but prefer a less government-oriented, or more tempered approach.
Surveys indicate a party electorate torn. A February Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed 53% of Democratic voters preferred a candidate pushing Sanders-like ""larger scale policies that might cost more"" and ""bring major change,"" versus 41% favoring a Biden-like candidate ""who proposes smaller scale policies that . . . will bring less change.""
But the same poll found Democrats, by 53% to 42%, favored a candidate ""with the best chance to defeat Donald Trump"" over one ""closest to your views"" -- and they have increasingly concluded Mr. Biden has the best chance.
When Mr. Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, appeared ascendant last month in the nominating contest, his sweeping platform of national health care, universal free college and a Green New Deal drew blistering criticism from Democratic stalwarts.
Harvard economist Lawrence Summers, a top adviser to both Presidents Clinton and Obama, predicted ""major adverse consequences"" for workers, markets and business investment should Mr. Sanders prevail. Former Obama White House chief economist Jason Furman, also now at Harvard, said the Sanders program would lead to ""too many individuals too constrained from choices"" and ""a weaker economy."" The Progressive Policy Institute, a Washington center-left think tank, branded the platform ""fiscal fantasy.""
None of that moved Mr. Sanders to soften his policies. Instead, Mr. Sanders and his aides have blasted the criticism and the critics as tainted and out of touch. They blame moderate Democratic economists and think tanks, as much as Republicans, for long-term wage stagnation and other economic worries still haunting millions of Americans.
""We need to think outside the box,"" said Warren Gunnels, Mr. Sanders's policy adviser. ""Over the past 45 years we've seen a massive increase in income and wealth inequality while the working class continues to struggle. It's too late for establishment economics.""
Mr. Sanders is more likely to discuss fostering a ""moral economy"" than strategies to boost gross domestic product, business investment or corporate profits. With his ""economic bill of rights,"" he wants Washington to guarantee all Americans a job, health insurance, college and housing.
Many Democratic economists ""would argue those are fine aspirations, but in order to achieve them, you'd have to intervene in markets beyond levels they're comfortable with,"" said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the chief economist in the Obama administration for then-Vice President Biden.
Mr. Sanders proposes sharply higher taxes, government spending and regulation. He would boost the size of the federal government's share of GDP to a level exceeded only during World War II.
While many Democrats over the past few decades have tried to balance government intervention with market forces, Mr. Sanders has less trust in markets to improve lives. On Thursday, he said his big-government vision of a national health-care plan and price controls on drug companies would put the country on stronger footing to address crises such as the coronavirus pandemic.
At times, he has dismissed cost concerns outright. Asked at a Feb. 18 CNN Las Vegas town hall about the price and feasibility of his plan to phase out fossil fuels, he replied: ""You tell me how much is too much if we're talking about saving this planet.""
Mr. Sanders wants to smash the conventional wisdom that he says has constrained thinking in Washington since Ronald Reagan -- a consensus that treats higher taxes and new government programs with suspicion -- and reopen discussion of liberal ideas that haven't been seriously considered since the 1970s.
The candidate already claims victory on that front, recounting how proposals from his failed 2016 bid, dismissed at the time as too far left, have since been embraced by Democratic party leaders.
One fight with Hillary Clinton, who won the 2016 Democratic nomination, was over his push to double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. The Democratic-led House last year passed a bill seeking to make that law, while all his 2020 rival candidates endorsed the goal. Mr. Sanders's 2016 proposal for a Wall Street tax on certain financial transactions was also embraced by much of the 2020 field. Mr. Biden's current positions on many issues, such as expanding Social Security and Medicare, have moved him closer to Mr. Sanders than the longtime Delaware politician has been for much of his career.
""I have been called radical and extreme,"" Mr. Sanders said in Iowa last year. ""Over the last four years . . . a whole lot of other people have become radical and extreme.""
Some mainstream center-left economists praise Mr. Sanders's bid to shake up the Washington consensus on restricting spending. ""All upper-income democracies in the world have much more generous welfare states than the U.S. and do fine,"" said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank that has long advised both Republican and Democratic administrations. ""We've gone so far off the rails in terms of underinvestment in the public sphere that even a massive shift would only get us part way to where we should be.""
The Sanders campaign has been the only major one in this election cycle to avoid even talking to top advisers of previous Democratic presidents. Economists who weren't part of the Clinton or Obama administrations have been close to the Sanders campaign. One is Stephanie Kelton, a professor at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, N.Y., who served as an aide to Mr. Sanders on the Senate Budget Committee. She is the leading proponent of ""modern monetary theory,"" which argues that governments shouldn't fret over debt and deficits.
Another is Darrick Hamilton of Ohio State University, whose work focuses on what he calls ""economic justice."" He aims to narrow the wealth gap between black and white households and has been a proponent of the federal job guarantee idea that Mr. Sanders has endorsed.
Mr. Sanders's wealth tax was written with the help of two French economists at the University of California, Berkeley, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman.
The Progressive Policy Institute estimates that Mr. Sanders is proposing adding just over $50 trillion in spending over 10 years, nearly doubling the federal government's current outlays. The new funds would mainly be used to expand the social safety net and infrastructure spending.
That is more than eight times the spending proposed by Mr. Biden, according to PPI.
Mr. Sanders would boost taxes by more than $20 trillion over 10 years, according to PPI, by increases in income, payroll and corporate taxes, as well as the new wealth tax.
That is six times the hikes laid out by Mr. Biden.
Most mainstream economists say spending and taxes on that scale would so distort the economy and private-sector activity that it would undermine growth. They warn that significantly higher tax rates could damp incentives for businesses and individuals to invest, while bigger payouts to households could curb incentives to work. They add that attempts by regulators to override market outcomes can impose costly inefficiencies in affected industries.
Mr. Gunnels, the Sanders aide, dismissed concerns about boosting the size of government. ""If we were a poor country . . . these would be legitimate questions,"" he said. ""We're not living in a Third World country. It's not too much to ask that everybody in this country has a decent standard of living.""
Sanders allies said his platform has successful parallels: Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1930s New Deal, which created Social Security and a raft of new government programs and regulations; and Lyndon B. Johnson's 1960s Great Society, which created Medicare and new antipoverty initiatives.
Harvard's Mr. Summers said the scale of Mr. Sanders's proposals would far exceed anything FDR or LBJ enacted, or even what South Dakota Democratic Sen. George McGovern proposed during his 1972 landslide loss to Richard Nixon, a defeat that helped usher in the party's retreat from liberalism.
If Mr. Sanders enacted his full program, government as a share of GDP would jump from the 2017 level of about 38%, one of the lowest levels in the developed world, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, to more than 50%. That is well above any peacetime level in U.S. history, but in line with European countries such as France and Denmark.
He also envisions a raft of new government regulations, from national rent control to new rules for CEO pay to an outright ban on fracking.
While some Democratic economists prefer to address climate change with market incentives, such as a carbon tax, Mr. Sanders would rely more on direct government orders. To protect energy workers who might lose their jobs, he promises five years of government-guaranteed salary, plus housing assistance, pension support and retirement subsidies for those who decide not to continue working.
That ""would be an utter nightmare to enforce,"" said Dean Baker, an economist at the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, saying it would be difficult to flesh out the criteria for who exactly would qualify.
Mr. Sanders would aim to shrink the role of the financial sector in the economy by, among other things, breaking up the largest banks, and reimposing Depression-era limits on banking activity.
He would make it harder for employers to fire workers, unionized or not, and would require big companies to give workers shares of company stock and the right to choose nearly half the seats on corporate boards. His goal is to recalibrate the balance of power between corporations and unions, who have seen their clout erode steadily over the past 40 years.
""In Bernie Sanders's world, the market doesn't come from a state of nature, it comes out of an allocation of power,"" said Robert Reich, a Berkeley public policy professor, who served as President Clinton's labor secretary and has periodically defended Mr. Sanders against attacks from other academics. ""The standard economic view is that the market is filled with potential win-win opportunities, but when you're talking about power, it's more complicated. Some people gain it and others lose it.""

The rapid ascent of Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries -- despite a weak showing in Saturday's South Carolina vote -- confronts American business with the once unthinkable: The most powerful policy maker in the world could soon be a strident, lifelong critic of capitalism and big business.
Current and former business leaders and analysts have greeted the prospect with a mix of concern, skepticism and disbelief. Most doubt the Vermont independent, who calls himself a democratic socialist and caucuses with Democrats, could win against President Trump in November, and if he does, could not or would not implement his boldest ideas.
If they are wrong, some see an existential threat. For most businesses, contingency planning boils down to one word: Congress. Health companies assume a Republican-controlled Senate would block Medicare for All, which would ban private insurance.
If, along with a Sanders win, the Democrats take both the House and Senate, ""There would be a close to apoplectic reaction"" in the health-care sector, said Chet Burrell, former chief executive of CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, which offers coverage in Maryland and the Washington, D.C., area. ""There would be an intense effort to intercede. . .and shape what would happen.""
In energy, Mr. Sanders seeks to shut down the extraction of oil and gas, in particular by banning hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking,"" of shale deposits, to deal with climate change.
""The shale revolution has created many, many jobs in the last decade,"" said J. Nelson Wood, chief executive of Wood Energy Inc., a small oil and gas producer in Illinois, that employs 25 people and operates 200 wells. ""That effectively ends if his policies are implemented.""
Mr. Sanders and his supporters argue policies under past presidents of both parties have disproportionately benefited the wealthy and corporations while ordinary workers' wages stagnated. They say his policies would address essential needs such as health insurance and climate change. They say jobs lost would be more than offset by jobs gained elsewhere.
They also play down the socialist label. Mr. Sanders has said he doesn't want the government to take over the means of production, the textbook definition of socialism. ""What democratic socialism is about is saying, 'Let's use the federal government to protect the interests of working families,' "" he said on ""60 Minutes.""
""If you're a modern day robber baron, then the policies of a Bernie Sanders administration will not be to your liking,"" said Josh Orton, Mr. Sanders's policy director, in an interview. ""If you are a small or medium-size businessthat desperately needs infrastructure, [such as] high-speed internet access to prosper in rural areas, or a manufacturing company or worker sick of free-trade agreements that have offshored production, then you will like the agenda of a Bernie Sanders administration.""
Mr. Sanders places himself in the tradition of previous Democratic presidents like Franklin Delano Roosevelt -- whose policies, Mr. Sanders has noted, were often labeled socialism. Mr. Roosevelt eschewed the socialist label even as he created a social safety net and enacted sweeping curbs on business.While running for re-election in 1936, he claimed, ""The old enemies of peace: business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering. . .are unanimous in their hate for me -- and I welcome their hatred.""
Today, critics on the right predict Mr. Sanders's policies would be catastrophic for the economy. Casey Mulligan, an economist at the University of Chicago who served in Mr. Trump's White House, predicted Mr. Sanders's policies would significantly shrink gross domestic product by discouraging work and investment with higher taxes and by replacing private ownership in some industries with less efficient public ownership.
Left-of-center economists dismiss those estimates as unfounded. Gabriel Zucman, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley who has advised Mr. Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, another presidential candidate, on tax policy, noted in Scandinavia, which has an economic system closest to what Mr. Sanders seeks, average income per adult and average wealth per adult are about the same as in the U.S. He said broadening access to education and health care historically has helped growth, and he said Medicare for All would significantly boost household purchasing power by eliminating insurance premiums.
Only once has Mr. Sanders ever actually held the reins of government, as mayor of Burlington, Vt., from 1981 to 1989. ""Bernie understood that you need business making a profit in order to do the social, environmental and cultural good that he espouses,"" said Tom Torti, current president of the Lake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce, who has known Mr. Sanders since then and is neutral in the current race.
At the time, a private businessman wanted to redevelop the waterfront. Mr. Sanders intervened to favor a different plan that resulted in below-market rate boat slips for local residents, public access and a community sailing center, Mr. Torti said. It is now ""a profitable development,"" he said. ""People make money. It's capitalism working with a social conscience.""
Nowadays, Mr. Sanders seldom utters the word capitalism without modifiers like ""unfettered,"" ""out of control"" and ""casino."" By contrast, Ms. Warren, who advocates many of the same policies, such as Medicare for All, calls herself a ""capitalist to my bones.""
Yet business and investors have been less exercised about Mr. Sanders's rise to front-runner than when Ms. Warren briefly reached the same position last fall.
Sarah Bianchi, a policy analyst at broker Evercore ISI, said one reason is that they thought Ms. Warren could beat Mr. Trump, but that Mr. Sanders couldn't. Prediction markets show that as the probability of Mr. Sanders winning the nomination rose clearly above 50% this year, so did the probability of Mr. Trump being re-elected.
Another reason, Ms. Bianchi said, is that Ms. Warren's affinity for the minutiae of policy suggests she would be more determined and effective at implementing her ideas.
By contrast, Mr. Sanders has been criticized for his lack of detail, in particular how he will pay for his programs. Cornerstone Macro, an investment research firm, estimates Mr. Sanders's promises would cost $67 trillion over the coming decade, but his tax increases would raise less than half that.
Mr. Sanders told ""60 Minutes"" he didn't have a price tag for all of his proposals but said ""we have options out there"" to finance Medicare for All. These include income-based premiums on individuals and employers that, his campaign said, would be lower than what most now pay in premiums.
Mr. Sanders has proposed sharply cutting drug costs, which he says are inflated by pharmaceutical companies, to what other wealthy countries pay. He would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices and allow importation of drugs from other countries, and set prices according to an index based on international rates.
Ian Spatz, a health-care consultant, said the moves would hurt the development of new medicines. ""When push comes to shove, do members of Congress want to kill the goose that lays the golden pharmaceutical eggs,"" he said.
Even without passing Medicare for All, Mr. Sanders could crimp health insurers' growth or margins through regulatory actions -- for instance, tweaking the rules on how they manage the private version of Medicare plans, a key business for the industry.
In energy, Mr. Sanders would withhold federal permits for any fossil-fuel infrastructure such as pipelines. He would also require electricity and transportation to be entirely based on renewable energy by 2030. Yet the necessary technology, such as for electric cars that are affordable for most consumers and profitable for manufacturers, doesn't yet exist.
""Nothing he does and says will make cars and trucks move without gasoline,"" said Chris Wright, chief executive of Liberty Oilfield Services, which operates fracking equipment. ""All he can do is harm domestic production, drive up prices, and turn us from an exporter to importer.""
Mr. Sanders's campaign proposes ""massive investments in research and development"" to ""drastically reduce"" the cost of energy storage and electric vehicles.
Kevin Book, research director at ClearView Energy Partners, an energy research firm, said a ban on private fracking wouldn't pass Congress so long as the Senate requires 60 votes for major legislation, and Trump-appointed judges would likely curb overly expansive regulatory action.
Mr. Book said that, much as Mr. Trump declared a national emergency on the southern border to justify redirecting federal funds to build a wall, Mr. Sanders could use his proposed designation of climate change as a national emergency to ban fossil fuel exports and shut down offshore drilling.
Mr. Orton of the Sanders campaign said that because scientists say the world has a tight window to take action before climate change does irreparable damage, ""We are not going to let the fossil-fuel industry complain that we're not going to compromise. They were uncompromising in their greed for the 40 years that they spent causing this crisis.""
Some of the fiercest opposition to Mr. Sanders comes from Wall Street. In an op-ed in Time Magazine, JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive James Dimon said socialism would be ""a disaster for our country."" Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, a lifelong Democrat, told the Financial Times ""I might find it harder to vote for Bernie than for Trump.""
Mr. Sanders, who advocates the Depression-era separation of banks and securities dealers and a tax on financial transactions, has reveled in their criticism. He has shot back at Mr. Blankfein on Twitter with barbs about his pay. One of his ads called Mr. Dimon ""the biggest corporate socialist"" in the country, citing the financial-crisis era bank bailouts and fines. JPMorgan has said it didn't need a bailout in 2008 and accepted one only at the urging of the Treasury, and quickly repaid it.
Yet some on Wall Street don't consider Mr. Sanders much more risky than other Democratic candidates, all of whom, including Mr. Bloomberg, have promised to tax or regulate finance more. ""No one is freaking out,"" said one banker. ""It will be tougher under a Democratic president, but it can be tougher in a 100 different ways."" Most presidents, he said, have only enough political capital to accomplish one or two big things in their first term, and Mr. Sanders is likely to spend his on health care rather than banking, which has attracted little attention in the campaign.
Compared to energy and health care, Mr. Sanders's ideas for remaking corporate governance have drawn less attention but are potentially more sweeping. He proposes that employees own at least 20% of large or public companies' shares and elect 45% of their directors. Companies that lay off employees because of foreign outsourcing or automation would have to issue them shares as compensation. Companies with larger gaps between executive and worker pay would pay higher tax rates. A new federal charter, mandatory for large and public companies, would require boards to consider the interests not just of shareholders, but of workers, customers and communities. Companies could be required to include women and minorities on boards.
Steven Fazzari, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis, said increased stock ownership by middle- and lower-income Americans could help offset rising income and wealth inequality, while rules ""that would push big business to improve diversity could be helpful in addressing multiple dimensions of inequality over time.""
Corporate governance experts said the plans would create internal governance problems. Employees wouldn't be independent directors, so conflict-of-interest rules would prevent them from serving on committees overseeing audits, board nominations and executive compensation, ""which is where the critical work of the company gets done,"" said Amy Borrus, deputy director of the Council of Institutional Investors.
Issuing 20% of shares to employees would, by diluting existing shareholders' returns, make a company's stock less attractive, encouraging it to issue more debt, said Nicholas Bloom, an economist at Stanford University. That would make it more leveraged and vulnerable to bankruptcy, he said.
And shareholders would likely sue to contest the expropriation of ownership and control from existing shareholders to employees, said B. Espen Eckbo, a finance professor who founded Dartmouth College's corporate-governance research center.

DEMOCRATS' WARINESS OF WALL STREET MONEY has complicated the political giving of one of the Street's most prominent M&A lawyers.
H. Rodgin Cohen, chairman of law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, is a prolific Democratic donor, giving to state parties and House, Senate and presidential campaigns. He has donated between $2,500 and $5,600 to six Democratic Senate challengers and four incumbents running for re-election this cycle—Michigan's Gary Peters, Alabama's Doug Jones, Minnesota's Tina Smith and Virginia's Mark Warner. He has donated to multiple Democratic presidential campaigns, including Joe Biden's and Pete Buttigieg's.
But Buttigieg returned
Cohen's donations
following a flurry of press about Cohen's Wall Street dealings, which included advising firms at the center of the 2008 financial crisis such as Lehman Brothers and American International Group Inc. (Some candidates, such as Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have been explicit about not accepting any financial industry donations.)
The campaigns were contacted by the Journal and informed of Cohen's Wall Street history, as well as his 2015 review of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein's personnel file for his company's board, in which Cohen found ""no unresolved claims that could result in liability."" After being asked for comment, the Peters and Jones campaigns said they were each donating $5,000 to nonprofits focused on sexual assault, equivalent to the amount of Cohen's donations.
Weinstein Co.'s board hired Cohen to look at the file after Weinstein's expenses and women's allegations of misconduct came to their attention. Cohen's review of Weinstein preceded the board's decision to renew Weinstein's contract later that year. Weinstein was convicted on sex-crimes charges this week in New York. Cohen declined to comment. Warner's campaign declined to comment. The Smith and Biden campaigns didn't respond to requests for comment.

Do you expect more Democratic candidates will refuse money from Wall Street-connected donors? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
TRUST IN AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS faces yet another test with the coronavirus epidemic. Some public health experts are alarmed at the rhetoric of elected and Trump administration officials relating to the outbreak. Some have presented a rosy outlook for the virus, with White House adviser Larry Kudlow on Tuesday claiming that the virus is ""contained,"" contradicting Centers for Disease Control officials. ""The impulse to mitigate economic harm is not a bad one,"" said Dr. Margaret Bourdeaux, research director for Harvard Belfer Center's Security and Global Health Project. ""But you can't PR your way out of a crisis.""
Republican Sen. Tom Cotton and Homeland Security's Ken Cuccinelli have suggested that the virus could have been developed as a biological weapon in a laboratory in Wuhan, China, the epidemic's epicenter.
A group of scientists pushed back strongly
on that theory in the Lancet, a medical journal. ""We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,"" they wrote of the virus. Cotton has said
he ""cannot rule out any explanation yet
,"" and Democratic and Republican leaders have traded insults about each other's handling of the crisis.
MASSACHUSETTS sees dogfight ahead of its Super Tuesday primary. Warren's advisers believe they can win her home state, though some have said they expect to see a competitive race.
A recent poll
shows Warren and Sanders almost tied in the state, with Buttigieg, Biden and Michael Bloomberg not far behind. Warren received a boost from the Boston Globe on Wednesday, which endorsed her after saying in December 2018 that she shouldn't run.
Sanders makes an overt play for the state with rallies there Friday and Saturday. Buttigieg put staffers on the ground in Massachusetts last week, and Bloomberg opened a Boston suburban field office in Medford, his hometown, with actor Michael Douglas. Sen. Amy Klobuchar has made digital ad investments and aims to pick off delegates in specific congressional districts. Biden still has hopes of winning the state or at least amassing delegates, and he has won the support of numerous party and union leaders in the state.
ANTI-PIPELINE ACTIVISTS aim to push fight against Atlantic Coast Pipeline into public consciousness, like previous battles against Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments Monday on whether to reinstate a construction permit for the pipeline, which would be built through two national forests and the Appalachian Trail. Twelve activists were arrested outside the court as a majority of the
justices signaled they were likely to allow
the permission process to go forward.
AMERICAN CATHOLICS disapprove of Trump at similar rates as the general population, and most would favor a Democratic challenger over the president in the election, according to
a new poll
from RealClear Opinion Research and EWTN News, a Catholic broadcast network. Among devout Catholics, who accept all or most of the Church's teachings, Trump's approval ratings are the highest: 63%, with 59% planning to vote for him. The devout Catholics surveyed were 41% Hispanic, which suggests higher support for Trump than the Hispanic population at large, which gave Trump around 28% of their votes in 2016, according to exit polls.

RALEIGH, N.C.—Democratic voters from here to California said they struggled to choose between pragmatism and policy on Tuesday, mirroring a national debate over whether sweeping political and economic changes or moderation were the keys to defeating President Trump.
Freelance marketing consultant Julie Cook, who had considered Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders because of his health-care plans, woke up Tuesday planning to vote for former Vice President Joe Biden, but hours later bubbled in former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Ms. Cook said she liked that Mr. Bloomberg plans to spend whatever it takes to win, noting she has struggled to explain Mr. Trump's verbose behavior to her 4- and 6-year-old daughters.
Mr. Trump ""is ridiculous,"" said Ms. Cook, 37 years old. ""It's gotten to the point that I can't stand to look at him on TV anymore.""
In Houston, onetime Hillary Clinton-backer Julia Kibbel voted for Mr. Sanders because of her work with the uninsured as a nurse practitioner in the county health department.
""He seems to be consistent, and he's more"" focused on social services, said Ms. Kibbel, 40.
Mr. Biden enjoyed a boost in the 72 hours before Super Tuesday, scoring a blowout win in South Carolina's primary Saturday and then securing endorsements from three opponents who left the race—former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke.
Many voters said the recent near-daily shifts in the Democratic field have made their choices fluid.
In Modesto, Calif., semi-retired ironworker Scott Szuggar, 54, said he was glad he held on to his mail-in ballot for a week. ""I kind of had a feeling that people were going to drop out,"" he said, as he left his ballot at a downtown voting center.
Mr. Szuggar said he had been leaning toward Mr. Bloomberg but cast his vote for Mr. Biden because he seemed to have momentum. ""He is starting to pick up a little steam here,"" he said.

Andrew Morrison, 50, a resident of Los Alamitos, Calif., who works in plastics manufacturing, voted for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, though he said she wasn't likely to get the nomination. ""If she can pick up some California delegates, it gives her more power to become a player later,"" he said.
At the Community College of Denver, Rebecca Turner, 26, an eco-psychology major, voted early for Mr. Sanders, but worries that he may not fare well in the general election.
""In a perfect world, Bernie Sanders would be my president,"" she said. If he doesn't get the nomination, she said she would vote for Mr. Biden. ""Bernie is the, 'Oh I wish,' and Biden is the 'That'll probably do.' ""
Voting centers on the Westside of Los Angeles were busy Tuesday morning, with some voters popping their heads in to judge the lines before committing to casting ballots before work.
Anya McGrath said she voted for Mr. Sanders inside an elementary school auditorium in the city's Mar Vista neighborhood. ""He is just more in touch with people like me, middle America,"" said Ms. McGrath, 36, a preschool teacher. ""He speaks for underserved people. I'm kind of all about getting money out of the hands of billionaires and getting it back to the people.""
Ms. McGrath said Ms. Warren was ""a close second,"" adding, ""I would take her,"" as she sat on a bench outside Beethoven Street Elementary School. ""I would take anyone but Trump.""

Back in Raleigh, roofer Larry Bostic, 34, said he chose Mr. Biden after watching last week's feisty debate in Charleston, S.C. ""That thing was fierce,"" he said. ""Biden was the only one up there maintaining professionalism. Everyone else was throwing jabs. We don't need that right now.""
Mr. Bostic, who is African-American, said Mr. Sanders's criminal-justice policies would help some of his friends who have made bad choices. But he said he couldn't get comfortable with his style.
""Imagine if you went to work one day and somebody asked you what you were doing and you just went, 'Rah rah!' "" he said, holding up his arms and shaking his wrists. ""You got to leave your feelings at the door a little bit.""
Lighting a cigarette, Mr. Bostic looked at the ground and said he had to admit that he had considered not voting. He said he had felt like his vote for Mrs. Clinton in 2016 didn't count when she won the popular vote but Mr. Trump won the White House.
""It feels hopeless to a lot of Americans,"" he said. ""But the idea of not doing anything and having an opinion? If you're not going to vote, don't complain.""

PARIS—Iowans who gathered here Monday for one of the Democratic Party's first-ever overseas caucuses gave two delegates to Elizabeth Warren and one each to Bernie Sanders and Amy Klobuchar.
There weren't many of them—just 17—but the overseas Iowans traveled from far and wide to get to the City of Light.
They included a U.S. military officer living in Cairo (for Bernie Sanders), an English teacher from London (also for Mr. Sanders), and a military spouse living in Germany, who arrived undecided but broke late for Ms. Klobuchar.
This is the first election cycle in which the Democratic National Committee has allowed so-called satellite caucuses abroad. Iowans also held caucuses in Glasgow, Scotland, and Tbilisi, Georgia. The Paris caucus took place in the ornate town hall of the 2nd arrondissement in the center of the French capital.
Emily Hagedorn, an Elizabeth Warren supporter, chaired the proceedings.
""I did both an online training and video call training for this,"" said Ms. Hagedorn, 20, a student at the University of Iowa who is doing a semester abroad in Paris.
Health care was a major issue for the caucus-goers here. Edmund Dean, the English teacher, said he previously voted for Republicans but was supporting Mr. Sanders because of the issue.
""A lot of it was living in Europe and enjoying free health care,"" Mr. Dean said.
Kate Vann-Lorenz, who works at a French aerospace company, said she supported Ms. Warren because of her Medicare-for-all plan.
""America has become a country where you're only OK if you're rich or your family is rich,"" she said.
Paige Greene, a veteran and military spouse, came to the Paris caucus from Germany. She said Ms. Klobuchar's centrism drew her support in the end.
""I think she'll be able to bring more conservative people to the party,"" Ms. Greene, 31, said.
Ms. Hagedorn led her fellow Iowans through the arcane process of the caucus. People grouped themselves in different areas of the room based on their preferred candidates. To pass the ""viability threshold"" and move to the ""second alignment,"" candidates need to get 15% of the vote.
Ms. Warren led with seven votes. Mr. Sanders had five, Ms. Klobuchar three and Pete Buttigieg two.
Mr. Buttigieg fell short of the threshold. So during the second alignment, supporters for the other candidates wooed them.
The final vote was eight for Ms. Warren, six for Mr. Sanders and three for Ms. Klobuchar. Then came the process of calculating how many delegates each candidate got.
""The rounding rules get a little crazy here,"" Ms. Hagedorn said.

MANCHESTER, N.H.—President Trump encouraged his supporters to vote in New Hampshire's Democratic primary, urging a rally crowd in Manchester on Monday to cast a ballot for whoever would be easiest for him to beat.
""Pick the weakest one you think,"" Mr. Trump said at Southern New Hampshire University Arena in his first campaign rally since his
acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial
. ""I don't know who it is.""
New Hampshire election laws allow independent voters to cast ballots in either a Republican or Democratic primary. Mr. Trump's political advisers generally view Sen. Bernie Sanders as the easiest to beat, they have said, but others on his team privately warn that early-state momentum for Mr. Sanders could carry into the general election.
A Democratic Party spokeswoman said, ""His effort tonight to encourage Republicans to interfere in the Democratic primary is an unsurprising and desperate attempt to fool voters.""
""Granite Staters are fed up with Trump's distractions, and will hold him accountable for his broken promises in November,"" said Maya Hixson.
Some of Mr. Trump's critics in the Republican Party opened a similar campaign over the weekend, urging independents to support a centrist candidate who would appeal to moderate voters in the fall. Their texts and phone calls didn't mention a specific candidate, but Bill Kristol, founder of the conservative Weekly Standard magazine, told the NH Journal that the effort was aimed at slowing the momentum of Mr. Sanders, who was leading primary polls in the state.
The president's rally was timed to counterprogram
Tuesday's Democratic presidential primary in the state
. Similarly, Mr. Trump held a rally within
days of the Iowa caucuses
last week, and held his high-profile campaign events during Democratic presidential debates.
Mr. Trump and his team have identified New Hampshire as one of their best opportunities to win new states in 2020, and have been pouring resources into this region for months. In 2016, Mr. Trump lost the New Hampshire by 0.3%, or about 2,700 votes out of 694,000 cast.
New Hampshire was among the first states in which the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee hired field staff. Their top staffers were announced in August.
With a little less than nine months before Election Day, the Trump team has knocked on 55,000 doors and made more than 70,000 phone calls to voters in the state, according to the Trump campaign. The campaign has held 80 volunteer training sessions and 160 meetups for Trump supporters, part of an effort in 17 key states to build campaign infrastructure ahead of the election.
Still, polls show Mr. Trump consistently trailing the major Democratic contenders in New Hampshire, which has four electoral votes. In a Marist College poll in January, Mr. Trump trailed former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg by 10 points, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders by 8 points and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren by 4 points.
Mr. Trump's approval rating has improved recently in New Hampshire, following national trends, but remains underwater at 42%, or 14 points below where it was when he was first elected, according to Morning Consult.
One of Mr. Trump's strongest pitches to voters this year, both nationally and in New Hampshire, his team says, is the performance of the economy during the past three years. The unemployment rate in New Hampshire is 2.6%, lower than the national average. Low-income workers, whose incomes stagnated during the 2007-09 recession, have seen wage growth in recent years, according to the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute.
But overall economic growth in New Hampshire trails the national average. Job growth has been fueled mostly by the real estate and insurance industries, according to federal data. Meanwhile, jobs in manufacturing, an industry Mr. Trump promises to revitalize, have been dropping in New Hampshire since 2018 but remain above levels when Mr. Trump took office.
Following the rally, Mr. Trump flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to meet the bodies of two
U.S. soldiers killed Saturday
in Afghanistan, the White House said. The soldiers were identified as Sgt. First Class Antonio R. Rodriguez and Sgt. First Class Javier J. Gutierrez. Vice President Mike Pence was also scheduled to attend.

The rapid ascent of Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries—despite
a weak showing in Saturday's South Carolina vote
—confronts American business with the once unthinkable: The most powerful policy maker in the world could soon be
a strident, lifelong critic of capitalism and big business
.
Current and former business leaders and analysts have greeted the prospect with a mix of concern, skepticism and disbelief. Most doubt the Vermont independent, who calls himself a democratic socialist and caucuses with Democrats, could win against President Trump in November, and if he does, could not or would not implement his boldest ideas.
If they are wrong, some see an existential threat. For most businesses, contingency planning boils down to one word: Congress. Health companies assume a Republican-controlled Senate would block Medicare for All, which would ban private insurance.
If, along with a Sanders win, the Democrats take both the House and Senate, ""There would be a close to apoplectic reaction"" across the health-care sector, said Chet Burrell, former chief executive of CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, which offers coverage in Maryland and the Washington, D.C., area. ""There would be an intense effort to intercede in that and shape what would happen.""
In energy, Mr. Sanders seeks to shut down the extraction of oil and gas in the U.S., in particular by banning hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking,"" of shale deposits, to deal with climate change.
""The shale revolution has created many, many jobs in the last decade,"" said J. Nelson Wood, chief executive of Wood Energy Inc., a small oil and gas producer in Illinois, that employs 25 people and operates 200 wells. ""That effectively ends if his policies are implemented.""
Mr. Sanders and his supporters argue policies under past presidents of both parties have disproportionately benefited the wealthy and corporations while ordinary workers' wages stagnated. They say his policies would boost the working class by taxing the rich and corporations while addressing essential needs such as universal health insurance and climate change. They say jobs lost in sectors such as fossil fuels would be more than offset by jobs gained elsewhere, such as in green energy.
They also play down the socialist label. Mr. Sanders has said he doesn't want the government to take over the means of production,
the textbook definition of socialism
. ""What democratic socialism is about is saying, 'Let's use the federal government to protect the interests of working families,' "" he said on ""60 Minutes"" a week ago.
""If you're a modern day robber baron, then the policies of a Bernie Sanders administration will not be to your liking,"" said Josh Orton, Mr. Sanders's policy director, in an interview. ""If you are a small or medium-size business that desperately needs infrastructure, [such as] high-speed internet access to prosper in rural areas, or a manufacturing company or worker sick of free-trade agreements that have offshored production, then you will like the agenda of a Bernie Sanders administration.""
Mr. Sanders places himself in the tradition of previous Democratic presidents like Franklin Delano Roosevelt—whose policies, Mr. Sanders has noted, were often labeled socialism. Mr. Roosevelt eschewed the socialist label even as he created a social safety net and enacted sweeping curbs on business. While running for re-election in 1936, he claimed, ""The old enemies of peace: business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering…are unanimous in their hate for me—and I welcome their hatred.""
Today, critics on the right predict Mr. Sanders's policies would be catastrophic for the economy. Casey Mulligan, an economist at the University of Chicago who served in Mr. Trump's White House, predicted Mr. Sanders's policies would significantly shrink gross domestic product by discouraging work and investment with higher taxes and by replacing private ownership in some industries with less efficient public ownership.
Left-of-center economists dismiss those estimates as unfounded. Gabriel Zucman, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley who has advised Mr. Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, another presidential candidate, on tax policy, noted in Scandinavia, which has an economic system closest to what Mr. Sanders seeks, average income per adult and average wealth per adult are about the same as in the U.S. He said broadening access to education and health care historically in the U.S. and throughout the world has helped growth, and he said Medicare for All would significantly boost household purchasing power by eliminating insurance premiums.
Only once has Mr. Sanders ever actually held the reins of government, as mayor of Burlington, Vt., from 1981 to 1989. ""Bernie understood that you need business making a profit in order to do the social, environmental and cultural good that he espouses,"" said Tom Torti, current president of the Lake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce, who has known Mr. Sanders since then and is neutral in the current race.
At the time, a private businessman wanted to redevelop the waterfront to feature hotels, stores, condominiums and a marina. Mr. Sanders intervened to favor a different plan that resulted in below-market rate boat slips for local residents, public access to the waterfront and a community sailing center, Mr. Torti said. It is now ""a profitable development,"" he said. ""People make money. It's capitalism working with a social conscience.""
Nowadays, Mr. Sanders seldom utters the word capitalism without modifiers like ""unfettered,"" ""out of control"" and ""casino."" By contrast, Ms. Warren, who advocates many of the same policies, such as Medicare for All, calls herself a ""capitalist to my bones.""
Yet business and investors have been less exercised about Mr. Sanders's rise to front-runner than when Ms. Warren briefly reached the same position last fall.
Sarah Bianchi, a policy analyst at broker Evercore ISI, said one reason is that they thought Ms. Warren could beat Mr. Trump, but that Mr. Sanders couldn't. Prediction markets show that as the probability of Mr. Sanders winning the nomination rose clearly above 50% this year, so did the probability of Mr. Trump being re-elected.
Another reason, Ms. Bianchi said, is that Ms. Warren's affinity for the minutiae of policy and insider's grasp of the law suggests she would be more determined and effective at implementing her ideas.
By contrast,
Mr. Sanders has been criticized by Republicans and other Democratic candidates for his lack of detail
, in particular how he will pay for his programs. Cornerstone Macro, an investment research firm, estimates Mr. Sanders's promises would cost $67 trillion over the coming decade, but his tax increases would raise less than half that.
Mr. Sanders told ""60 Minutes"" he didn't have a price tag for all of his proposals but said ""we have options out there"" to finance Medicare for All. These include income-based premiums on individuals and employers that, his campaign said, would be lower than what most now pay in premiums.
Many businesses believe Mr. Sanders's plans are unworkable, promising significant loss of jobs and investment in existing industry with little guarantee that new jobs and services will take their place.
Mr. Burrell, the former CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield CEO, said if Mr. Sanders's Medicare for All plan paid hospitals and other health-care providers at the rates currently paid by Medicare, ""You'd probably bankrupt the health-care system…That's not sustainable.""
Mr. Sanders has proposed sharply cutting drug costs, which he says are inflated by pharmaceutical companies, to what other wealthy countries pay. He would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices and allow importation of drugs from other countries, and set prices according to an index based on international rates.
Ian Spatz, a health-care consultant, said the moves would hurt the development of new medicines. ""When push comes to shove, do members of Congress want to kill the goose that lays the golden pharmaceutical eggs,"" he said.
Even without passing Medicare for All, Mr. Sanders could crimp health insurers' growth or margins through regulatory actions—for instance, tweaking the rules on how they manage the private version of Medicare plans, a key business for the industry.
In energy, Mr. Sanders would withhold federal permits for any fossil-fuel infrastructure such as pipelines. He would also require electricity and transportation to be entirely based on renewable energy by 2030. Yet the necessary technology, such as for electric cars that are affordable for most consumers and profitable for manufacturers, doesn't yet exist.
""Nothing he does and says will make cars and trucks move without gasoline,"" said Chris Wright, chief executive of Liberty Oilfield Services, which operates fracking equipment. ""All he can do is harm domestic production, drive up prices, and turn us from an exporter to importer.""
Mr. Sanders's campaign proposes ""massive investments in research and development"" to ""drastically reduce"" the cost of energy storage and electric vehicles.
Kevin Book, research director at ClearView Energy Partners, an energy research firm, said a ban on private fracking wouldn't pass Congress so long as the Senate requires 60 votes for major legislation, and Trump-appointed judges would likely curb overly expansive regulatory action.
But he said that energy executives don't realize the rest of the world increasingly sees them as part of the problem of climate change. Having spent careers learning how to deliver oil and gas cheaply and efficiently, they ""can't understand there are people who have spent their careers figuring out how to shut them down,"" he said. Mr. Sanders ""is one of them.""

Democratic Candidates Target Bernie Sanders in South Carolina Debate

Mr. Book said that, much as Mr. Trump declared a national emergency on the southern border to justify redirecting federal funds to build a wall, Mr. Sanders could use his proposed designation of climate change as a national emergency to ban fossil fuel exports and shut down offshore drilling.
He added that Mr. Trump's repeal of a rule limiting methane emissions from fracking wells leaves Mr. Sanders free to issue a new rule that is so restrictive it effectively makes fracking uneconomical.
Mr. Orton of the Sanders campaign said that because scientists say the world has a tight window to take action before climate change does irreparable damage, ""We are not going to let the fossil-fuel industry complain that we're not going to compromise. They were uncompromising in their greed for the 40 years that they spent causing this crisis.""
Some of the fiercest opposition to Mr. Sanders comes from Wall Street, which leans more Democratic than most industries. In an op-ed in Time Magazine, JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive James Dimon said socialism would be ""a disaster for our country."" Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, a lifelong Democrat, told the Financial Times ""I might find it harder to vote for Bernie than for Trump.""
Mr. Sanders, who advocates restoring the Depression-era separation of banks and securities dealers and a tax on financial transactions, has reveled in their criticism. He has shot back at Mr. Blankfein on Twitter with barbs about his pay. One of his ads called Mr. Dimon ""the biggest corporate socialist"" in the country, citing the financial-crisis era bank bailouts and fines. JPMorgan has said it didn't need a bailout in 2008 and accepted one only at the urging of the Treasury, and quickly repaid it.
Yet some on Wall Street don't consider Mr. Sanders much more risky than other Democratic candidates, all of whom, including Mr. Bloomberg, have promised to tax or regulate finance more. ""No one is freaking out,"" said one banker. ""It will be tougher under a Democratic president, but it can be tougher in a 100 different ways."" Most presidents, he said, have only enough political capital to accomplish one or two big things in their first term, and Mr. Sanders is likely to spend his on health care rather than banking, which has attracted little attention during the campaign.
Share Your Thoughts
How would your business fare if Bernie Sanders won the election? Join the discussion below.
Compared to energy and health care, Mr. Sanders's ideas for remaking corporate governance have drawn less attention but are potentially more sweeping. He proposes that employees own at least 20% of large or public companies' shares and elect 45% of their directors. Companies that lay off employees because of foreign outsourcing or automation would have to issue them shares as compensation. Companies with larger gaps between executive and worker pay would pay higher tax rates. A new federal charter, mandatory for large and public companies, would explicitly require boards to consider the interests not just of shareholders, but of workers, customers and communities. Companies could be required to include women and minorities on their boards.
Increasing worker ownership of companies is a longstanding goal of Mr. Sanders. Last year, he attended the annual general meeting of Walmart Inc. in Rogers, Ark., to support a proposal that hourly employees be considered for positions on the board. Just 0.01% of shareholders backed it.
Steven Fazzari, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis, said increased stock ownership by middle- and lower-income Americans could help offset rising income and wealth inequality, while rules ""that would push big business to improve diversity could be helpful in addressing multiple dimensions of inequality over time.""
Corporate governance experts said the policies would create enormous internal governance problems. Employees wouldn't be independent directors, so conflict-of-interest rules would prevent them from serving on committees overseeing audits, board nominations and executive compensation, ""which is where the critical work of the company gets done,"" said Amy Borrus, deputy director of the Council of Institutional Investors.
Issuing 20% of shares to employees would, by diluting existing shareholders' returns, make a company's stock less attractive, encouraging it to issue more debt, said Nicholas Bloom, an economist at Stanford University. That would make it more leveraged and vulnerable to bankruptcy, he said.
And shareholders would likely sue to contest the expropriation of ownership and control from existing shareholders to employees, said B. Espen Eckbo, a finance professor who founded Dartmouth College's corporate-governance research center.

WASHINGTON—Sen. Elizabeth Warren said that Sen. Bernie Sanders, one of her rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, told her during a private 2018 meeting that a woman couldn't win the U.S. presidency—a statement Mr. Sanders denies.
Ms. Warren, in a statement distributed by her campaign Monday evening, said that she and Mr. Sanders met for more than two hours just over a year ago when each senator was laying the groundwork for a White House bid.

""Among the topics that came up was what would happen if Democrats nominated a female candidate. I thought a woman could win; he disagreed,"" Ms. Warren said. ""I have no interest in discussing this private meeting any further because Bernie and I have far more in common than our differences on punditry.""
The Massachusetts Democrat added: ""We have been friends and allies in this fight for a long time, and I have no doubt we will continue to work together to defeat Donald Trump and put our government on the side of the people.""
The statement drives a wedge into what largely had been a
friendly rivalry
between the two most liberal remaining contenders in the 2020 primary. Ms. Warren's remarks came hours after CNN reported that she had told associates that Mr. Sanders, an independent from Vermont, had made the comment about a woman being unable to be elected president. Mr. Sanders denied that notion in a lengthy statement of his own.
""It is ludicrous to believe that at the same meeting where Elizabeth Warren told me she was going to run for president, I would tell her that a woman couldn't win,"" Mr. Sanders said, adding that Ms. Warren's staff were ""lying about what happened"" to reporters.
At that time on Monday, Ms. Warren herself hadn't directly weighed in. A representative for the Sanders campaign said Monday night that Mr. Sanders stood by his earlier comment.
Though he rejected that he said a woman couldn't win the presidency, Mr. Sanders in his statement did allow that gender would play a role in the election if a woman won the 2020 Democratic nomination.
""What I did say that night was that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could. Do I believe a woman can win in 2020? Of course! After all, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 3 million votes in 2016,"" Mr. Sanders said.
Mrs. Clinton won the popular vote in the last presidential election, while Mr. Trump won more electoral votes.
Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have largely teamed up during Democratic debates to defend the party's leftward flank—and ideas like a single-payer health care plan—from criticism by more moderate candidates. Allies of Ms. Warren suggested Monday night that the senators should begin to de-escalate the conflict over the meeting ahead of Tuesday's debate in Iowa.
The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a group backing Ms. Warren, called the narrative ""counter-productive for progressives.""
""In this pivotal moment of the campaign, progressives must work together to defeat Donald Trump and prevent a less-electable establishment candidate like Joe Biden from getting the nomination,"" the PCCC said in a statement by its two co-founders.
Iowa will kick off the Democratic balloting contest with caucuses on Feb. 3.

WASHINGTON -- House lawmakers are readying to campaign in the post-impeachment landscape, with Democrats eager to focus on policy issues and Republicans planning to attack swing-district Democrats for voting to remove a president whom many of their constituents support.
Democrats plan to defend the majority, and specifically their 30 seats in districts that President Trump won in 2016, by discussing the issue that gave them the gavel in 2018: lowering health-care costs. Lawmakers expect to stay far away from talking about the two articles of impeachment the House passed against the president in December.
Republicans, meanwhile, will largely embrace running on the ballot alongside Mr. Trump. Their message will be national: attacking Democrats for impeachment and tying themselves to successes in the economy and the president.
""The Democrats who voted for impeachment from districts that Trump won with a majority are in serious trouble,"" said David Wasserman, the House race analyst from the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. Twelve House Democrats won in districts where the president won more than 50% of the vote, while 18 Democrats took districts that Mr. Trump won with a plurality.
Republicans credit the impeachment investigation for boosting fundraising. In the first six weeks of this year, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has raised over $1.5 million online, according to an aide. By comparison, he raised $1.3 million in the final quarter of 2019.
""They are going to lose the House because they haven't accomplished anything . . . . They made a promise to the American people that they were going to be different,"" Mr. McCarthy (R., Calif.) said of Democrats on Thursday. He plans to meet with donors in Key Biscayne, Fla., this weekend, along with 50 House GOP members.
Mr. Wasserman said it is more likely that Republicans pick up a few seats, but not enough to win the majority.
Democrats counter that they have passed hundreds of bills, and laid out a legislative agenda that largely hasn't been taken up by the GOP-controlled Senate. Democrats expecting competitive races spent the off-year building war chests for a year where they will have to campaign in areas that Mr. Trump won in 2016. The House Democrats' campaign arm raised $125 million in 2019 and outraised the National Republican Congressional Committee every month, according to information from the committees. That shifted in January when the NRCC bested the Democrats.
Republican incumbents have been admonished by leadership for low fundraising numbers. NRCC Chairman Rep. Tom Emmer (R., Minn.) said last month that ""members need to get their act together and raise more money.""
""Our members and candidates need to get better with their individual fundraising so the NRCC can go on offense this fall,"" said NRCC spokesman Chris Pack. ""If we're playing defense in seats, that significantly hinders our chance to make a run at the majority.""
While Republicans need to win a net of 18 seats to take the majority, Democrats will benefit from North Carolina redistricting that puts two seats in their favor and four Republican retirements in swing districts in Texas and Georgia. Republicans acknowledge that they will likely need to win 25 seats to compensate for those expected Democratic wins, an unlikely effort.
Last year, vulnerable Democrats raised a collective $93 million, with 13 of those lawmakers having over $2 million in cash to spend on their re-election. None plan to focus on impeachment on the campaign trail, and they say the effort to punish the president for pushing a foreign power to investigate his rivals doesn't come up when they talk to constituents.
""No one's talking to me about impeachment,"" said Rep. Haley Stevens (D., Mich.).
Democrats who won GOP-held seats in 2018 are more frantic about Sen. Bernie Sanders's strong showing in the first two presidential primary contests than impeachment attacks and they see the self-proclaimed democratic socialist's rise as putting the majority at risk.
""I do worry, if Bernie Sanders is at the top of the ticket, the impact it will have all the way down,"" said Rep. Dina Titus (D., Nev.), who is backing former Vice President Joe Biden.
The House Republican Conference was left with just 13 women lawmakers after losses in 2018, but a record-breaking number of Republican women are running for office this cycle, after a widespread effort by the party and groups such as Winning for Women, the first GOP super PAC dedicated solely to electing women. Nine of the 13 seats the Republicans see as top targets in November have a viable woman running in the primary.
Still, several Republican strategists concede that they have failed to recruit strong candidates in districts that could have been more winnable, such as those of Rep. Antonio Delgado in New York and Ms. Stevens in Michigan.
While the big landmark bills that Democrats have highlighted this year, such as a bill to lower the cost of prescription drugs or expanding background checks for gun purchases, have languished in the Senate and have little chance of becoming law, several House Democrats can tout minor legislative success uniquely focused on their districts.
Several pieces of legislation including the National Defense Authorization Act gave freshmen lawmakers something to point to. For example, Rep. Anthony Brindisi of New York pushed a bill that requires the Department of Defense to purchase American-made flatware and dinnerware for service members, legislation that will benefit manufacturing in his district.

NASHUA, N.H.—Democrats in search of a centrist nominee to challenge President Trump are increasingly worried after contests in
Iowa
and
New Hampshire
consolidated liberal support behind Bernie Sanders and divided the larger moderate vote among multiple candidates.
The party's center lane is crowded with the rising former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Vice President Joe Biden. Looming in the
March 3 Super Tuesday states
and beyond is former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, buoyed by
campaign spending that dwarfs all his opponents combined
.
With no clear centrist front-runner, vulnerable freshman Democrats in Congress are texting each other anxiously, a Biden-allied fundraiser warns of a ""doomsday scenario"" and party strategists fret about what mixed early-state turnout means for November.
Predictions about which candidates are the most electable and which will prevail through a long primary season have proven unreliable in the past, particularly at this early stage of the process, before voting in the diverse states of South Carolina and Nevada. Barack Obama faced intraparty doubts in 2008, as did Mr. Trump in 2016.
With multiple contenders vowing to stay in the race, party leaders are yet again bracing for the likelihood of a protracted fight for the nomination that may not be settled by the time of the July convention in Milwaukee.
Adding to some Democrats' worries is the president's
acquittal from impeachment
and his strength among his most fervent supporters, as evidenced by the more than 11,000 who turned out for his
Monday night rally in Manchester, N.H.
, a larger crowd than any assembled by a Democrat campaigning in the state.
""There is one thing that's universal, and that is anxiety,"" said Rufus Gifford, who served as finance director for President Obama's re-election campaign and has contributed to several campaigns.

The fear among some Democrats is predicated on the idea that Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator and self-described democratic socialist, would struggle to defeat Mr. Trump in November. Mr. Sanders and his supporters believe the party could unite around him if he is the nominee and that he could energize young voters and those in crucial Rust Belt states who swung to the GOP in 2016.
The Sanders campaign disputed the notion he would hurt Democrats in swing districts, noting that candidates in states that will be crucial in 2020 had requested his help during 2018 midterms.
Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg, a 38-year-old newcomer to the national scene, essentially tied in Iowa and finished one-two in New Hampshire. Ms. Warren has faded in the first two contests but is pressing forward, while Ms. Klobuchar, the No. 3 finisher in New Hampshire, is eyeing delegates when her home state of Minnesota votes on March 3.
If Mr. Biden has a strong showing in South Carolina and Nevada, he could regain lost momentum and potentially persuade wavering Democrats to stick with him through subsequent states.
Mr. Bloomberg meanwhile has poured more than $350 million of his fortune into a series of March states, including California, Texas and North Carolina.
Philip Levine, a former mayor of Miami Beach, Fla., who supports Mr. Bloomberg, said in an interview he received ""an avalanche"" of phone calls and emails Wednesday from donors asking how they could help, and from elected officials, whom he didn't name, asking his advice on ""how to tactfully retract"" their endorsements of Mr. Biden and shift their support to Mr. Bloomberg.
Some Democratic donors say privately there will be a lot of pressure for Mr. Biden to get out after South Carolina if he performs poorly there.
""We are going to compete in Super Tuesday states,"" said Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a Biden campaign co-chairman. ""Bloomberg is spending an awful lot of money, but he's also not had his turn in the barrel. He has not been on the debate stage. He's untested.""
Larry Rasky, who leads a pro-Biden super PAC called Unite the Country, sought to rally Biden donors in a fundraising memo Sunday by telling them that if they hedge their bets on Mr. Biden because of Mr. Bloomberg, they could be creating a ""doomsday scenario.""
""The Sanders-Warren wing of the Party is ready for the Bloomberg fight. Democrats cannot afford a split Convention. Do you really think the Sanders voters wing will support Mike Bloomberg? Do you think all the camps who have busted their butts and played by the rules will happily sign on"" to Mr. Bloomberg's campaign, he wrote.
The party's attempt to present itself as a steady, competent alternative to Mr. Trump has been
marred by the chaotic Iowa caucuses
, where more than a week later Mr. Sanders narrowly trails Mr. Buttigieg in state delegates, but Mr. Sanders leads in the popular vote. Both candidates have requested a recanvassing of certain precincts.
Party strategists are watching early-state turnout closely for clues about whether Democrats are energized to vote.

More than 176,000 people participated in the Iowa Democratic caucuses this year, a slight increase from four years ago but well behind the nearly 240,000 who caucused in 2008. New Hampshire was a brighter spot for Democrats: Turnout reached about 297,000 voters in the Democratic primary, compared with about 255,000 in 2016 and nearly 290,000 in 2008.
""Everything is splintered,"" said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist and former adviser to West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. ""And it just shows that voters aren't falling in love with any of these candidates, and that's a problem.""
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who has conducted focus groups in early-voting states and general-election battlegrounds, said she has been struck by ""the duality of who you like and who you think can beat Trump. And they're not necessarily the same thing.""

In a sign of Democrats' interest in finding an alternative to Mr. Biden, some moderate House Democrats have embraced Mr. Bloomberg, including Reps. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Haley Stevens of Michigan and Scott Peters of California. On Wednesday, two African-American members of Congress, Reps. Lucy McBath (D., Ga.) and Gregory Meeks (D., N.Y.) said they were backing Mr. Bloomberg. All are members of the centrist New Democrat Coalition.
Rep. Stephanie Murphy, the chairwoman of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition caucus, said Mr. Sanders wouldn't be able to win over swing voters, and if he becomes the party's nominee, he could put the new House majority at risk. ""For many moderate districts and Trump-won districts, Bernie Sanders at the top of the ticket would create headwinds for house members running for re-election,"" she said.

Former Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, who supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, said in a tweet Tuesday that ""Sanders is just as polarizing as Trump AND he'll ruin our economy."" Mr. Sanders's campaign manager tweeted back: ""This is what panic from the Wall Street elite looks and sounds like.""
For most of the campaign, Mr. Biden has presented himself as the candidate best able to win states narrowly carried by Mr. Trump, including his boyhood state of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.
""He did not have a shot to win Iowa or do well in Iowa,"" said Rep. Tim Ryan (D., Ohio), who endorsed Mr. Biden after his own candidacy failed. ""His two strongest groups are communities of color and older voters, and both are pretty much excluded from the caucus process.""
Mr. Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, joined a conference call with the campaign's top financial donors on Wednesday afternoon, according to three participants, and noted the campaign's strength in Nevada and South Carolina among Latinos and African-Americans.
Polls indicate that Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar both have struggled to appeal to African-American voters. Mr. Bloomberg apologized for a second time Tuesday amid a fresh round of criticism for his support of stop-and-frisk policing in New York City.
Mr. Sanders has argued that Democrats must nominate someone who can generate enthusiasm and mobilize young people and infrequent voters who were turned off by their choices in the 2016 election. The senator has arguably the best ability to command large crowds, evidenced by more than 7,500 people who showed up for a primary eve rally and concert at the University of New Hampshire.
In the last week, Mr. Sanders has taken the lead in the RealClearPolitics average of national Democratic primary polls, after Mr. Biden had led for months.
While Mr. Biden's candidacy has foundered, Mr. Bloomberg has courted members of Congress. In January, Mr. Bloomberg flew to Salt Lake City where Rep. Ben McAdams (D., Utah) hosted the former mayor at his home with local Democrats and Republicans. Mr. Bloomberg talked about his hope for a pragmatic government and answered questions on climate change and fiscal responsibility.
Mr. McAdams said he was looking for someone he could support, but also said he was looking for someone who understood a congressional district like his own, which the president carried by 7 percentage points in 2016.
About a week later, he endorsed Mr. Bloomberg.

Iowa caucus officials on Monday. Nevada's Democratic Party says it is evaluating backup plans after ditching an app like the one that malfunctioned in Iowa. PHOTO: Christopher Lee for The Wall Street Journal
With its caucuses about two weeks away, Nevada's Democratic Party is assessing plans for reporting results, scrambling to meet a tight timeline now that it has ditched an app
like the one that upended Iowa's contest
.
The Nevada State Democratic Party told presidential campaigns Tuesday night that ""everything is on the table"" and that it is evaluating backup plans. Options could include relying on phones and not using an app, party spokeswoman Molly Forgey said. Earlier Tuesday the party said it wouldn't use an app commissioned from Shadow Inc., the company that created the app that glitched in Iowa.
Nevada's Ms. Forgey said the party's contingency and backup plans have been in place for more than a year, and it is evaluating the next steps even though time is running short.
""We know we need to get it right,"" Ms. Forgey said Wednesday. ""Our timeline is ASAP.""
Nevada is the third early nominating state, after Iowa and New Hampshire, and the first nominating contest with a diverse population. Its caucuses take place on Feb. 22, with early in-person voting beginning Feb. 15 for four days.
Election-security experts warn that putting any new solutions in place under such a compressed timeline increases the risk of error.
In Iowa, party officials rolled out the app built by Shadow several weeks ago, though the final version wasn't issued until a few days before Monday's caucuses, precinct officials said. The app malfunctioned, with a coding error affecting the reporting of results. Backup phone systems jammed too, delaying tabulation of the outcome. Paper records were used to tally the results.
Maurice Turner, an election expert at the nonprofit Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington, said it is ""healthy that the Nevada Dems are reassessing their plans"" given the Iowa debacle. Any new app, however, wouldn't likely undergo thorough testing for security and reliability in time, he said, pointing out that many states freeze changes to election systems 90 days before voting.
""If an app is used in Nevada, it has to be perfect,"" Mr. Turner said. ""There is no room for error.""
Nevada's Ms. Forgey said the state Democratic Party isn't excluding any option to share early-voting and caucus reporting results from local precincts with the state party before the numbers are disclosed publicly. The party could forgo using an app-based solution, she said.
The Iowa mishap has put Nevada under pressure to hold a successful event. Caucuses are run by the state political parties, unlike primary or general elections, which are overseen by state and local officials. Some experts say Iowa's problems show the need for elections to be run by career bureaucrats.
""Elections should be run by elections professionals—people who do this work for a living—not political parties,"" Judd Choate, Colorado's elections director, said on Twitter. ""Caucuses are party meetings. They aren't elections.""
Nevada in the past has used a telephone system to report results, Ms. Forgey said. ""That's something we've done in the past, and something we are certainly capable of doing,"" she said.
The state Democratic Party about a year ago began looking for a vendor to build a system that would communicate to it results from early voting and its precincts.
The Nevada State Democratic Party paid Shadow $58,000 in August for ""technology services,"" less than the $63,000 Iowa paid, according to Federal Election Commission records.
Nevada State Democratic Party chair William McCurdy II, executive director Alana Mounce, caucus director Shelby Wiltz and other Nevada-based political experts are among those discussing next steps, Ms. Forgey said.
Ms. Mounce and Ms. Wiltz held one-on-one calls with presidential campaigns Tuesday and spearheaded a broader call among presidential campaigns Tuesday evening, Ms. Forgey said.
Jeff Weaver, senior adviser to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders's campaign, said the Nevada Democratic Party is trying to be transparent in its efforts by briefing the campaigns in the aftermath of the problems in Iowa.
""Obviously, it would be better if the process were locked, but given what happened in Iowa, it is appropriate that the Nevada party takes steps to ensure that we don't have a repeat performance in the Silver State,"" he said. ""What seems to make the most sense is to not use any untested app to try to do calculations or reporting during the Nevada caucus.""
The state party also has been in touch with volunteers, including about potential new training, Ms. Forgey said, and has held regular discussions with security experts and consulted with the cybersecurity wing of the Department of Homeland Security and the Democratic National Committee.
Both DHS and the DNC confirmed they had been in contact with Nevada Democrats but declined to discuss specifics.

Voters across 14 states are weighing in on the Democratic presidential nomination contest as Sen. Bernie Sanders seeks to fend off newly resurgent Joe Biden after the former vice president's
landslide victory in South Carolina
.
For up-to-the-minute coverage, see WSJ's
Super Tuesday blog

Mr. Biden's strength with African-American voters there helped resurrect his campaign after three straight losses, and the Democratic establishment

began consolidating around him
on Monday with the endorsements of Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who
ended their presidential bids
. Mr. Biden is hoping a strong
Super Tuesday
will position him as the sole alternative to Mr. Sanders of Vermont.
The endorsements Monday also put pressure on Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to prove they have viable paths to the nomination in the narrowing field.
Tuesday is the first time diverse swaths of the country are simultaneously voting in the Democratic presidential race, with more than a third of the party's 3,979 pledged delegates up for grabs. In addition to delegate-heavy California and Texas, the states holding primaries are: Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Massachusetts, Maine, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont and Virginia. The territory of American Samoa and Democrats abroad will also hold contests.
Mr. Bloomberg, who is appearing on ballots for the first time after skipping the states that voted in February, has placed a heavy bet on March contests. He is hoping that
the more than half a billion dollars he has spent
on an advertising barrage and his extensive ground operation will catapult him into the top tier.
Ms. Warren's campaign says she believes she can amass enough delegates to justify continuing in the race even if she doesn't win any states outright. Her campaign released a memo this weekend forecasting a chaotic ending to the contest with no candidate winning the majority of delegates needed to secure the nomination ahead of the summer convention.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What changes, if any, do you expect to the Democratic lineup after Super Tuesday? Join the conversation below.
At a rally in suburban Los Angeles Monday, Ms. Warren focused her fire on Mr. Biden, saying a ""Washington insider"" would be the wrong choice to run against President Trump.
""Nominating a man who says we do not need any fundamental change in this country will not meet this moment,"" she said.
While Mr. Biden racked up endorsements from his rivals and former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Monday, Mr. Sanders remains the front-runner. The self-described democratic socialist has a lead in delegates, a sizable war chest and a dedicated base of supporters who helped him win in New Hampshire and Nevada. He also essentially tied Mr. Buttigieg for the lead in Iowa.
Mr. Sanders is expected to do well in several Northeastern states, including Ms. Warren's home state of Massachusetts, as well as California, the night's crown jewel, where more than 415 pledged delegates are at stake.
He also stands to benefit from the large number of early votes cast in California and Texas, which could blunt the impact of any late swing of support to Mr. Biden.

Through the weekend, more than 1.4 million Democratic ballots had been returned in California and another million in Texas.
A large portion of those votes were cast when the race looked very different: Mr. Sanders was riding high off his victories, Mr. Buttigieg was close on his heels after his win in Iowa—and Mr. Biden's campaign was sputtering. Billionaire activist Tom Steyer, who spent more than $210 million on advertising, including a heavy investment in California, was also in the race until Saturday.
On Monday, even before news of the endorsements by Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Sanders said his campaign was making powerful players in the Democratic Party nervous.
""There is a massive effort trying to stop Bernie Sanders that's not a secret to anybody in this room. The corporate establishment is coming together. The political establishment is coming together, and they will do everything,"" the senator said.
Mr. Sanders drove his wife Jane to the polls at a community center in Burlington, Vt. on Tuesday morning in their green Subaru Forester with a ""Bernie 2020"" sticker on the back. ""I want to make sure we get at least two votes in Vermont,"" he joked before walking in.

Mr. Biden could still gain in the Election Day voting, buoyed by voters turning to him after the departures of Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg, who competed with him for the support of the party's moderates.
Late Monday, Mr. Buttigieg joined Mr. Biden at a campaign stop in Dallas and said he was ""delighted"" to support the former vice president.
""When I ran for president, we made it clear that the whole idea was about rallying the country together to defeat Donald Trump and to win the era for the values that we share. And that was always a goal that was much bigger than me becoming president,"" Mr. Buttigieg said.
At a separate event with Mr. Biden, Ms. Klobuchar said she couldn't think of ""a better way to end my campaign than joining his,"" causing the former vice president to tear up.
""What I want all of you to do is vote for Joe. Vote for decency, vote for dignity, vote for our heart, for our country,"" she said to cheers.
Mr. Biden described the endorsements of his former rivals in personal terms, saying that Mr. Buttigieg reminded him of his late son, Beau Biden. He also praised Ms. Klobuchar as a senator who ""knows how to get things done—she really does. That's why Amy has never lost and she's not losing now. You're going to hear a lot from Amy Klobuchar.""

Mr. Biden also received the endorsement of Beto O'Rourke, the former presidential candidate and former Texas congressman. Mr. O'Rourke said he would cast his ballot for Mr. Biden on Tuesday. ""We need somebody who can beat Donald Trump,"" he said.
At a competing event in St. Paul, Minn., Mr. Sanders called Ms. Klobuchar ""one of the hardest workers that I know"" and credited Mr. Buttigieg with ""running a historic and a brave campaign.""
""So to all of Amy and Pete's millions of supporters, the door is open. Come on in,"" Mr. Sanders said.
Mr. Bloomberg acknowledged in a press conference in Miami Tuesday morning that his only path to the Democratic nomination was through a contested convention.
""I don't think I can win in any other ways,"" he said, adding that he didn't need to win a state to stay competitive.
The billionaire said he was not planning on dropping out, despite Mr. Biden consolidating moderate support ahead of Super Tuesday.
""Have you asked Joe whether he's going to drop out?"" he said in response to questions from reporters at his field office in Little Havana. ""When you ask him that, then you can call me.""

NASHUA, N.H. -- Democrats in search of a centrist nominee to challenge President Trump are increasingly worried after contests in Iowa and New Hampshire consolidated liberal support behind Bernie Sanders and divided the larger moderate vote among multiple candidates.
The party's center lane is crowded with the rising former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Vice President Joe Biden. Looming in the March 3 Super Tuesday states and beyond is former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, buoyed by campaign spending that dwarfs all his opponents combined.
With no clear centrist front-runner, vulnerable freshman Democrats in Congress are texting each other anxiously, a Biden-allied fundraiser warns of a ""doomsday scenario"" and party strategists fret about what mixed early-state turnout means for November.
Predictions about which candidates are the most electable and which will prevail through a long primary season have proven unreliable in the past, particularly at this early stage of the process, before voting in the diverse states of South Carolina and Nevada. Barack Obama faced intraparty doubts in 2008, as did Mr. Trump in 2016.
With multiple contenders vowing to stay in the race, party leaders are yet again bracing for the likelihood of a protracted fight for the nomination that may not be settled by the time of the July convention in Milwaukee.
Adding to some Democrats' worries is the president's acquittal from impeachment and his strength among his most fervent supporters, as evidenced by the more than 11,000 who turned out for his Monday night rally in Manchester, N.H., a larger crowd than any assembled by a Democrat campaigning in the state.
""There is one thing that's universal, and that is anxiety,"" said Rufus Gifford, who served as finance director for President Obama's re-election campaign and has contributed to several campaigns.
The fear among some Democrats is predicated on the idea that Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator and self-described democratic socialist, would struggle to defeat Mr. Trump in November. Mr. Sanders and his supporters believe the party could unite around him if he is the nominee and that he could energize young voters and those in crucial Rust Belt states who swung to the GOP in 2016.
The Sanders campaign disputed the notion he would hurt Democrats in swing districts, noting that candidates in states that will be crucial in 2020 had requested his help during 2018 midterms.
Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg, a 38-year-old newcomer to the national scene, essentially tied in Iowa and finished one-two in New Hampshire. Ms. Warren has faded in the first two contests but is pressing forward, while Ms. Klobuchar, the No. 3 finisher in New Hampshire, is eyeing delegates when her home state of Minnesota votes on March 3.
If Mr. Biden has a strong showing in South Carolina and Nevada, he could regain lost momentum and potentially persuade wavering Democrats to stick with him through subsequent states.
Mr. Bloomberg meanwhile has poured more than $350 million of his fortune into a series of March states, including California, Texas and North Carolina.
Philip Levine, a former mayor of Miami Beach, Fla., who supports Mr. Bloomberg, said in an interview he received ""an avalanche"" of phone calls and emails Wednesday from donors asking how they could help, and from elected officials, whom he didn't name, asking his advice on ""how to tactfully retract"" their endorsements of Mr. Biden and shift their support to Mr. Bloomberg.
Some Democratic donors say privately there will be a lot of pressure for Mr. Biden to get out after South Carolina if he performs poorly there.
""We are going to compete in Super Tuesday states,"" said Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a Biden campaign co-chairman. ""Bloomberg is spending an awful lot of money, but he's also not had his turn in the barrel. He has not been on the debate stage. He's untested.""
Larry Rasky, who leads a pro-Biden super PAC called Unite the Country, sought to rally Biden donors in a fundraising memo Sunday by telling them that if they hedge their bets on Mr. Biden because of Mr. Bloomberg, they could be creating a ""doomsday scenario.""
""The Sanders-Warren wing of the Party is ready for the Bloomberg fight. Democrats cannot afford a split Convention. Do you really think the Sanders voters wing will support Mike Bloomberg? Do you think all the camps who have busted their butts and played by the rules will happily sign on"" to Mr. Bloomberg's campaign, he wrote.
The party's attempt to present itself as a steady, competent alternative to Mr. Trump has been marred by the chaotic Iowa caucuses, where more than a week later Mr. Sanders narrowly trails Mr. Buttigieg in state delegates, but Mr. Sanders leads in the popular vote. Both candidates have requested a recanvassing of certain precincts.
Party strategists are watching early-state turnout closely for clues about whether Democrats are energized to vote.
More than 176,000 people participated in the Iowa Democratic caucuses this year, a slight increase from four years ago but well behind the nearly 240,000 who caucused in 2008. New Hampshire was a brighter spot: Turnout reached about 297,000 voters in the Democratic primary, compared with about 255,000 in 2016 and nearly 290,000 in 2008.
""Everything is splintered,"" said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist and former adviser to West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. ""And it just shows that voters aren't falling in love with any of these candidates, and that's a problem.""
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who has conducted focus groups in early-voting states and general-election battlegrounds, said she has been struck by ""the duality of who you like and who you think can beat Trump. And they're not necessarily the same thing.""
In a sign of Democrats' interest in finding an alternative to Mr. Biden, some moderate House Democrats have embraced Mr. Bloomberg, including Reps. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Haley Stevens of Michigan and Scott Peters of California. On Wednesday, two African-American members of Congress, Reps. Lucy McBath (D., Ga.) and Gregory Meeks (D., N.Y.) said they were backing Mr. Bloomberg.
Rep. Stephanie Murphy, the chairwoman of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition caucus, said Mr. Sanders wouldn't be able to win over swing voters, and if he becomes the party's nominee, he could put the new House majority at risk. ""For many moderate districts and Trump-won districts, Bernie Sanders at the top of the ticket would create headwinds for house members running for re-election,"" she said.
Former Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, who supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, said in a tweet Tuesday that ""Sanders is just as polarizing as Trump AND he'll ruin our economy."" Mr. Sanders's campaign manager tweeted back: ""This is what panic from the Wall Street elite looks and sounds like.""
For most of the campaign, Mr. Biden has presented himself as the candidate best able to win states narrowly carried by Mr. Trump, including his boyhood state of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.
Polls indicate that Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar both have struggled to appeal to African-American voters. Mr. Bloomberg apologized for a second time Tuesday amid a fresh round of criticism for his support of stop-and-frisk policing in New York City.
Mr. Sanders has argued that Democrats must nominate someone who can generate enthusiasm and mobilize young people and infrequent voters who were turned off by their choices in the 2016 election. The senator has arguably the best ability to command large crowds, evidenced by more than 7,500 people who showed up for a primary eve rally and concert at the University of New Hampshire.
In the last week, Mr. Sanders has taken the lead in the RealClearPolitics average of national Democratic primary polls, after Mr. Biden had led for months.

Betting markets show Hillary Clinton is one of the top contenders in the race for the Democratic nominee.
She isn't running for president.
Prediction markets have become a popular, though not necessarily reliable, way for people to bet on political results. While notoriously volatile and often proven wrong, betting markets are drawing extra scrutiny ahead of this week's Super Tuesday contests.
Consider PredictIt, an online market run by New Zealand's Victoria University of Wellington. Offering a range of election and other political bets, PredictIt currently shows a bettor can pay 7 cents to win $1 if Mrs. Clinton wins the Democratic nomination. Those are the fourth-best odds of any nominee, better than those of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren or former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
Perhaps the prediction markets know something others don't, but Mrs. Clinton isn't a candidate. (A PredictIt spokesman said Mrs. Clinton's odds were likely a reflection of ""trader long-shot bias"" and the possibility of a brokered convention, among other factors.)
Other metrics also show extremes that don't mesh with what more traditional political polls show. Bettors at one point on PredictIt last month gave former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg a 33% chance of winning the nomination.
Those odds -- which placed him in second place at the time and came on some of the heaviest volume PredictIt has logged over the past 90 days -- were also far higher than the probabilities he garnered in other political polls.
The 2020 campaign has largely been a secondary factor driving recent financial-market performance. Stocks are coming off their worst week since the financial crisis on fears of how the spreading coronavirus could crimp the global economy and profits.
Yet some investors also are trying to decipher what the Super Tuesday outcomes could mean for markets, particularly as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is a leading contender for the nomination.
Chris Senyek, chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research, said the markets' recent swoon was driven by ""rising Covid-19 fears, and, to a lesser extent, Bernie Sanders' strong momentum.""
Mixing politics and portfolios has historically had a mixed record. The conventional wisdom heading into the 2016 presidential election was a Donald Trump victory would prompt stocks to go down. Betting markets played down then-candidate Trump's chances. Of course, the opposite played out.
Goldman Sachs analysts said prediction markets suggest a divided federal government is the most probable election outcome, one that could lead to additional uncertainty if corporate tax reform implemented under President Trump is reversed. Under that scenario, Goldman said, ""the impact on S&P 500 profits would be significant.""
The firm is no longer expecting U.S. companies to post any earnings growth in 2020. It expects exporters will register falling demand and companies will suffer from supply-chain disruptions as a result of the spreading coronavirus outbreak, which could pose widespread disruptions on people's everyday lives and business activity and imperil the U.S. economy's longest expansion on record.
""An economic slowdown caused by this virus certainly increases Bernie's chances,"" said Dave Lutz, managing director and head of ETF trading at JonesTrading.
The thinking is a struggling economy, or even a recession, could hurt Mr. Trump's odds at being re-elected, paving the way for whoever becomes the Democratic nominee. PredictIt shows Mr. Sanders has a greater than 50% chance of securing the nomination, but only a 31% chance of beating President Trump in the election.
One indicator Goldman Sachs analysts are watching is second-quarter gross domestic product growth. Historically, this has been one of the most important metrics to watch in gauging a sitting U.S. president's re-election probability.

Sen. Bernie Sanders has taken sole possession of the lead in the Democratic primary race, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds, with four candidates essentially tied for second place amid declining support for former Vice President Joe Biden and the rising profile of Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor.

Full results of February poll

*
Past WSJ/NBC polls

Mr. Sanders had 27% support among Democratic primary voters nationally in the new survey, the same as in January. Mr. Biden, who previously had 26%, has dropped 11 percentage points since last month.
Mr. Biden is bunched closely with Mr. Bloomberg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who each have 14% support, and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, with 13%. Sen. Amy Klobuchar has 7%.
The four-way tie for second place shows that Democrats enter their third nominating contest, Saturday's caucuses in Nevada, with the race for the party's political center unsettled.
As in prior surveys, about 40% of Democrats say their top choice is one of the most ardent liberals, Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren, with 45% to 50% picking a more centrist candidate. The difference now is that more candidates are dividing the party's self-described centrist voters, while Mr. Sanders has expanded his lead over Ms. Warren among liberals.
Another sign of the muddle among Democrats: No prior Journal/NBC News poll had found more than three candidates with double-digit support. This month's survey has five.
The new Journal/NBC News survey also finds that President Trump has suffered little political damage, and possibly has gained ground, after the impeachment trial in Congress. Some 47% approve of his job performance, a high mark that he has hit only once before, with 50% disapproving. Approval among independents hit a record 51%.
Among all voters, 53% approve of how Mr. Trump is handling the economy, also a new high. A majority of 51% say the Senate was right to vote against removing Mr. Trump from office in the impeachment trial, with 47% favoring removal.
Mr. Trump's job-approval rating still lags behind that of the last two predecessors seeking re-election, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush. Both were at 50% approval at about this point in prior elections, though with lower ratings on the economy.
In another caution signal for Mr. Trump, he trails the leading Democrats in test general-election matchups: Mr. Trump trails Mr. Biden by 8 percentage points; Mr. Bloomberg by 7 points; Mr. Sanders by 4 points; and Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg by smaller margins.
An unpredictable factor in the Democratic race is the rising profile of Mr. Bloomberg, who entered the contest late and has spent more than $385 million of his personal fortune to introduce himself through TV, radio and web ads, according to ad tracking data from CMAG/Kantar. Now, voters will get a less filtered view of Mr. Bloomberg. He is scheduled to appear with other leading candidates on the debate stage Wednesday for the first time, after his standing in recent national polls met the party's eligibility requirements.
Amid the scramble for second place, the poll displayed one point of clarity in the Democratic race: Mr. Sanders holds the lead alone. ""Bernie Sanders is the definitive front-runner, and his numbers represent not his ceiling but his base, with room to grow,'' said Democratic pollster Peter Hart.
Mr. Hart noted that 65% of Democratic primary voters say they are enthusiastic about Mr. Sanders' candidacy or comfortable with it—a larger share than for any other candidate, and well above his 27% support as the voters' first choice for nominee.
""It's a mistake at this stage to say we're looking at his peak, because it just looks to me that as the field narrows, he becomes the beneficiary, especially if Elizabeth Warren drops out,'' said Mr. Hart, who worked on the survey with Jeff Horwitt, also a Democrat, and Republican Bill McInturff.
The survey also showed Mr. Sanders' strength when testing him in hypothetical, two-person races against some of his Democratic rivals, to assess coalitions that could materialize later in the nomination process. Mr. Sanders topped Mr. Bloomberg in a two-person race, 57% to 37%, and he led Mr. Buttigieg by 16 points, 54% to 38%.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What, if any, results from this recent poll surprise you? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Biden, in contrast to Mr. Sanders, has lost ground. According to Mr. McInturff, the Biden support is moving to several other candidates, including to Mr. Sanders, and not just to the two candidates who gained support since January, Messrs. Bloomberg and Buttigieg.
Mr. Sanders won the popular vote in Iowa's disputed caucuses and New Hampshire's primary, though Mr. Buttigieg emerged with a small lead in the score that matters: He tops Mr. Sanders by a single convention delegate. Now, however, the Democratic Party's primary rules could give Mr. Sanders a boost, if his lead in national polls holds in state nominating contests.
Those rules award delegates only to candidates who reach 15% support in a state, congressional district or in some cases other geographic areas. Mr. Sanders is well above that threshold in the national survey, while his top competitors are at just about the cutoff mark or below it.
""Sanders has strong enough support to be in a delegate race everywhere,'' Mr. McInturff said.
The survey found that Mr. Sanders would carry potential liabilities into a general election. More than half of all voters said that a candidate who had had a heart attack in the past year or was older than 75 would leave them with reservations or make them very uncomfortable. Mr. Sanders fits both descriptions. Two-thirds said they were uncomfortable with a socialist; Mr. Sanders calls himself a democratic socialist.
By contrast, voters showed lower levels of discomfort with a candidate who is gay or under age 40, two qualities that fit Mr. Buttigieg. In both cases, substantial majorities said they would be enthusiastic about or comfortable with a candidate with those characteristics.
The Journal/NBC News poll surveyed 900 registered voters from Feb. 14-17 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.27 percentage points. The margin of error for the 426 Democratic primary voters in the survey was plus or minus 4.75 percentage points.

President Trump's team has been weighing the prospects of a race against a populist outsider or a party stalwart. Michigan's Democratic primary may determine just what they get.
The Midwestern battleground, voting on Tuesday, is the first major general election battleground state to hold a primary. Tuesday is the first day Democrats cast a ballot since voters whittled the race down to two candidates a week before.
In 2016, President Trump became the first Republican to win Michigan since George H.W. Bush in 1988, eking out a victory over Hillary Clinton that was powered by strong support in white rural areas and benefited from the fact that Mrs. Clinton couldn't match former President Obama's turnout in majority-black districts.
In that year's Democratic nomination race, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders won the state, and he retains loyal support among young people and liberals. But former Vice President Joe Biden appears to have momentum after a strong Super Tuesday that showed him consolidating moderate support, and he has gathered key endorsements in the state.
Each Democrat argues he is best equipped to defeat Mr. Trump.Mr. Sanders says he can bring to the party new voters who support his message of radical political change, while Mr. Biden's allies stress his backing among centrist suburban voters will be critical in November. Recent general election polling of head-to-head matchups with Mr. Trump in Michigan show both Democrats ahead of the president.
For weeks, Mr. Trump and his associates had openly been agitating for Mr. Sanders, with the president seeking to stir up the Vermont senator's supporters by claiming without evidence the Democratic establishment had fixed the race for Mr. Biden. But the Trump team's focus turned to Mr. Biden again after his wins on Super Tuesday.
A key question is whether Mr. Biden can bring back to the Democratic fold voters in the Rust Belt states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which Mr. Trump swept in 2016 to take the White House, as well as compete in historic swing states like Florida.
""I'll tell you, I was all set for Bernie, because I thought it was going to happen,"" Mr. Trump said during a Fox News town hall Thursday. ""In a certain way Bernie would be tougher because he's got a base,"" he said, but added, ""I think it's going to be very hard for him to come back.""
Some Democratic voters in Detroit and its suburbs said they preferred a contest between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden, fearing Mr. Sanders's suite of policy proposals are too far to the left.
""I'm happy with Biden getting stronger. Bernie has a lot of good criticisms to make, but I still feel like in my heart Biden is our best choice,"" said Sara Frank, 69 years old, a retiree from West Bloomfield. ""He would have a broader reach.""
Aaron Parks, 24, who works in the health-insurance industry, backed Mr. Sanders in 2016 but this year said he is supporting Mr. Biden. He said when he knocked on doors for Mr. Sanders in Commerce Charter Township four years ago, he found resistance to his liberal policies.
""What I like most about [Mr. Biden] is he's going to resonate with people around here,"" he said.
But Megan Hakala, 31, who works at Wayne State University and lives in Garden City, said if Democrats chose Mr. Biden, Mr. Trump could beat him in Michigan.
""He just doesn't have the passion. I have not met anyone, personally, who is fired up about Biden the way people are fired up about Bernie,"" she said. ""I think that the passion has to be there for the Democratic candidate in order to beat Trump.""
Michigan, which offers 125 delegates to the Democratic convention awarded proportionately, could prove a critical moment in the primary race, either as the state in which Mr. Biden solidifies his march to the nomination or where a strong victory enables Mr. Sanders to remain competitive.
Mr. Sanders has said a loss in Michigan's primary won't force him out of the race, and he has made an aggressive push in Michigan in the final days before the primary, canceling events in other states to add extra stops there.
Mr. Biden was expected to appear later Monday with California Sen. Kamala Harris, who endorsed him Sunday, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who announced his backing Monday. Meanwhile, Mr. Biden has sent surrogates including Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a former primary rival, and has key backers in the state, including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
Heading into Tuesday, Mr. Sanders has begun to criticize Mr. Biden's trade record more forcefully, hitting his support for trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement. His aides feel the criticism resonates with Michigan's large union population and would be a powerful general election argument. They argue Mr. Trump won Michigan and other Midwest states in part because he focused on the trade deals.
Mr. Biden is expected to focus on his record as vice president while trying to avoid a back-and-forth with Mr. Sanders.
He likely also will emphasize his role in the 2009 bailout of General Motors and Chrysler, as well as the Affordable Care Act, issues that he would likely continue to stress in a general election. His aides said his strong showing in suburban swing districts on Super Tuesday show he will be competitive in Michigan.
One Biden adviser said, ""Vice President Biden has actually been on two presidential tickets that won Michigan.""

National security adviser Robert O'Brien sought to use a series of television interviews broadcast Sunday to rebut reports that the Russian government is trying to help President Trump be re-elected.
""There's no briefing that I've received, that the president has received, that says that President Putin is doing anything to try and influence the elections in favor of President Trump,"" Mr. O'Brien said on the CBS News program ""Face the Nation."" ""I've seen no intelligence along those lines.""
But Mr. O'Brien appeared to choose his words carefully and didn't dispute news reports that Shelby Pierson, the top election security official for the director of national intelligence, had briefed the House Intelligence Committee last week that Russia appear to
have a preference for Mr. Trump
in the 2020 presidential race.
Mr. O'Brien didn't deny that Russia is using social media and other means to interfere in the U.S. election process with the aim of exacerbating the tensions in American society.
""The Russians have always tried to interfere with elections because they want to divide Americans,"" he said.
Concerns have mounted in recent weeks among Democratic lawmakers that Russia is trying to involve itself in U.S. presidential politics to boost Mr. Trump's prospects, much as the U.S. intelligence community and Special Counsel Robert Mueller
concluded Moscow did
in 2016.
Mr. Trump has denied that Russia played a role in getting him elected in 2016 and said there is no proof that he or his campaign attempted to collude with the Kremlin.
While playing down reports alleging Russian support for Mr. Trump, Mr. O'Brien confirmed accounts that
Russia is seeking to help Sen. Bernie Sanders
win the Democratic nomination
""What I've heard from the FBI…is that Russia would like Bernie Sanders to win the Democrat nomination,"" Mr. O'Brien said. ""They'd probably like him to be president, understandably, because he wants to spend money on social programs and probably would have to take it out of the military.""
Mr. O'Brien also appeared on ABC's ""This Week"" with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday.
Some political analysts say that Russia favors Mr. Sanders's nomination because Russian officials calculate that he would be the weakest opponent as Mr. Trump seeks re-election and because each man is a polarizing figure for many Americans.
Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, criticized Mr. O'Brien for his remarks about Mr. Sanders.
""Our national security adviser should stay out of politics,"" Mr. Murphy said on the CNN ""State of the Union"" news program. ""What I am worried about is the politicization of intelligence by this administration.""
Mr. Sanders has said that he was warned by U.S. officials that Russia is trying to assist his campaign and he has urged Russia to stay out of the election.

CHARLESTON, S.C.—Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, days after a resounding victory in the
Nevada caucuses
, took the bulk of incoming fire
on the debate stage
here ahead of this state's Saturday primary.
The Democratic electorate in South Carolina is roughly 60% black, according to the state party, and all of the candidates sought to win over black voters, a powerful Democratic constituency. This state is seen as a must-win for former Vice President Joe Biden, though recent public surveys show that Mr. Sanders is gaining momentum here.
Like the Nevada debate a week before it, the South Carolina match included some sharp barbs. Seven candidates squared off: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren; Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar; former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; billionaire and activist Tom Steyer; former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg; and Messrs. Biden and Sanders.
Here are the moments that mattered:
Sanders in the hot seat
""No, the math does not add up.""—Sen. Amy Klobuchar
Why this matters: Mr. Sanders stood in the center of the stage for the first time this election, underscoring his front-runner status. He certainly earned front-runner scrutiny.
""No, the math does not add up,"" Ms. Klobuchar said to Mr. Sanders, saying that his Medicare for All proposal was too expensive. She also said that Democratic Party elders, including former President Obama, had opposed his idea for expansive government proposals. ""They are not with you,"" she said.
He also took heat for his votes against the 1993 Brady Bill, which established mandatory background checks, while Mr. Sanders was a member of the House. Mr. Sanders called it a bad vote. Mr. Sanders also was criticized by Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg for his refusal to back rolling back the legislative filibuster in the Senate.
""This is not some long-ago bad vote that Bernie Sanders took. This is a current bad position that Bernie Sanders holds,"" Mr. Buttigieg said. ""How are we going to deliver a revolution if you won't even support a rule change?""
Mr. Sanders argues that rolling back the filibuster cuts both ways, and Republicans could take advantage of its absence, too.
Warren finally critiques Sanders
""I dug in, did the work, and Bernie's team trashed me for it.""—Sen. Elizabeth Warren
Why this matters: Ms. Warren has long been loath to be seen criticizing Mr. Sanders, whose supporters she doesn't want to alienate. After underperforming him in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, Ms. Warren offered her sharpest contrast with him.
""So look, the way I see this is that Bernie is winning right now because the Democratic Party is a progressive party, and progressive ideas are popular ideas,"" Ms. Warren said, before critiquing his plan as vague.
Scrutiny on Ms. Warren's Medicare for All plan by centrists who said it was unreasonable, and from many on the left who said it didn't go as far as Mr. Sanders's bill, was a big reason why Ms. Warren's position in the 2020 race has slipped.
""Bernie and I both want to see universal health care, but Bernie's plan doesn't explain how to get there, doesn't show how we're going to get enough allies into it, and doesn't show enough about how were going to pay for it,"" Ms. Warren said. ""I dug in, I did the work, and then Bernie's team trashed me for it.
Warren and Bloomberg have another testy exchange over NDAs
""If it bothered them, I was wrong and I apologize. I'm sorry for that.""—former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg
Why this matters: One of the most fiery moments happened when Ms. Warren once again confronted Mr. Bloomberg over complaints by several women about his behavior. She talked about her experience of getting fired from a teaching job in the 1970s because she was pregnant.
""At least I didn't have a boss who said to me 'kill it' the way that Mayor Bloomberg is alleged to have said to one of his pregnant employees,"" Ms. Warren said. ""I never said that,"" Mr. Bloomberg said. But Ms. Warren used the allegation to continue to hammer Mr. Bloomberg on the nondisclosure agreements between three women and his company, Bloomberg LP, and called on him to release any other women from any unreported NDA.
Mr. Bloomberg declined to do so but offered new apologies to women who have made complaints about comments he has made in the workplace.
""If it bothered them, I was wrong and I apologize. I'm sorry for that,"" Mr. Bloomberg said. ""Nobody accused me of doing anything other than just making a comment or two.""
He also clapped back at Ms. Warren for continuing to press the issue after he decided to release three women from NDAs. ""What the senator did suggest was that we release these women from the nondisclosure agreement. I did that two days later,"" adding: ""The trouble is, with this senator, enough is never enough.""
Buttigieg says Sanders has 'nostalgia' for 'revolutionary politics' of the 1960s
""This is not about what coups were happening in the 1970s or '80s, this is about the future.""—former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg
Why this matters: Asked about his Cuba comments, Mr. Sanders said he has opposed authoritarianism all over the world and equated his praise of the Cuban government's literacy program to President Obama's. ""What Barack Obama said is they made great progress on education and health care. That was Barack Obama.…And when dictatorships, whether it is the Chinese or the Cubans, do something good you acknowledge that, but you don't have to trade love letters with them,"" he said.
Mr. Buttigieg portrayed Mr. Sanders's past praise of some aspects of leftist governments as a weakness against Mr. Trump.
""I am not looking forward to a scenario where it comes down to Donald Trump with his nostalgia for the social order of the 1950s and Bernie Sanders with a nostalgia for the revolutionary politics of the '60s,"" he said. ""This is not about what coups were happening in the 1970s or '80s, this is about the future. This is about 2020.""
Biden says not to count him out
""When you're knocked down, get up.""—former Vice President Joe Biden
Why this matters: Mr. Biden entered the race in April 2019 the undeniable front-runner. His campaign is now in clear peril after he finished fourth in Iowa, fifth in New Hampshire, and second in Nevada. Mr. Sanders and Mr. Steyer now challenge Mr. Biden among black Democrats, a bloc the Biden campaign had long considered the linchpin of his candidacy.
""When you're knocked down, get up,"" Mr. Biden said when asked, during the last round of questioning, to explain his life motto. It's an often-repeated phrase the former vice president uses on the campaign trail to urge Democrats who feel defeated by President Trump's presidency.

Super Tuesday propelled Joe Biden into a two-way race for the Democratic nomination with Bernie Sanders, and
last night's series of victorie
s strengthened the former vice president's standing in the race for the Democratic nomination. While we watch to see if the surge lifts him to the nomination and then the White House, let's take a look at what business can expect from Mr. Biden.
Would it simply be a continuation of policies pursued during President Barack Obama's eight years in office?
Mr. Biden's tenure as vice president, of course, started amid a crippling financial crisis and was followed by a long period of slow-growth recovery.
At the time,
executives often complained
about the buildup of new regulations. Politicians
criticized companies for underinvesting
, hiring too slowly and hoarding corporate cash overseas.
Now, he's running against the more liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders. The emergence of ""middle-of-the-road Joe"" is seen as positive for business by comparison, said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst for Raymond James Financial Inc.
But every candidate needs to build coalitions. Winning the support of progressive voters could force Mr. Biden to adopt more aggressive positions on taxation or workers' rights.
Today, Mr. Biden is campaigning as an ardently pro-worker candidate who criticizes practices like stock buybacks and excessive executive compensation. His record suggests that, at heart, he's a pragmatist reasonably friendly to business interests.
Which Joe Biden would business get if he wins the White House? Here's where he stands on key issues:
Trade: Mr. Biden was among the Democrats voting in favor of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, and played a key role in the Obama administration's support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Mr. Biden now says he would renegotiate TPP as a counterweight to China. He has indicated the U.S. does need to remain tough on China—particularly in areas of intellectual property theft or technology transfers—but advocates for a broader coalition of support among trading partners.
Mr. Biden wouldn't completely abandon tariffs as a stick or quotas on carbon-intensive goods from countries failing to meet environmental obligations.
Taxes: If Mr. Biden wins the nomination, taxes are one of the areas where business leaders should feel they ""dodged a bullet compared with Sanders or Elizabeth Warren,"" said Allison Schrager, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. Mr. Biden's plan picks up certain proposals from the end of the Obama administration that Mr. Trump killed.
While Mr. Biden wants to increase the corporate tax rate—from 21%, where Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cut has left it—he doesn't want to return to the 35% precut rate. He proposes a 28% income-tax rate on companies and a 15% minimum tax on global book income with a credit for foreign taxes paid, according to the
Urban Institute's analysis
.
Credits would limit some of the increase. These include tax credits targeting communities hit hard by mass layoffs; electric-car and solar subsidies; and enhanced incentives for carbon capture. Mr. Biden's plan would eliminate certain tax benefits for the real-estate industry, fossil-fuel companies and pharmaceutical companies.
Environment: Mr. Biden has said he wants to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord and sees the Green New Deal as a ""framework"" for progress. He plans to hold oil executives accountable to commitments to alternative energy.
But ""he's not an ideologue,"" Mr. Mills said. Other analysts agree, saying Mr. Biden is more of an incrementalist, meaning his climate commitment may be more accommodating to economic growth and corporate profits.
Uncertainty: Mr. Trump's erratic tweeting and trade wars create confusion even when the economy is strong, some business leaders say. Concern about the coronavirus has slowed growth, and the election is sure to feature questions about who can restore confidence.
Mr. Biden is ""more predictable than Trump—at least he's on the spectrum of what we consider normal for communication styles,"" Ms. Schrager said. This makes a difference for companies making long-term investment decisions.
Workers: Mr. Biden has said
employees don't have enough leverage
, partially because of globalization and partially because declining unionization has weakened their bargaining power with management.
Mr. Biden favors a $15 per hour minimum wage (a proposal often opposed by business trade groups) and wants to revise worker classifications that determines who receives overtime pay.

MIAMI—Sen. Bernie Sanders's recent comments on Cuba have drawn condemnation in Latino-heavy Florida and fanned some Democrats' fears that he would doom their chances of winning the swing state if he is the party's presidential nominee.
In a ""60 Minutes"" interview that aired Sunday, he said that while he opposed the authoritarian government in Cuba, ""it's unfair to simply say everything is bad…When Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing?""

The Vermont senator didn't back down in a CNN town hall Monday night. ""The truth is the truth,"" he said. ""That's what happened in the first years of the Castro regime.""
The comments convulsed South Florida, home to generations of Cuban-Americans who fled the Communist government, as well as Nicaraguans, Venezuelans and others who emigrated because of socialist regimes or guerrillas. Democrats, from elected officials to rank-and-file party members, denounced the remarks and expressed dismay at the potential damage to down-ticket candidates.

""It's malpractice to make comments like that, which only antagonize the Hispanic vote, the most critical vote in the most important swing state,"" said Fernand Amandi, a Democratic strategist in Miami who is Cuban-American.
Mike Casca, a spokesman for the Sanders campaign, said, ""Sen. Sanders has clearly and consistently criticized Fidel Castro's authoritarianism and condemned his human-rights abuses."" He cited similar comments President Obama made about Cuba's progress on issues like education.
Mr. Sanders, the Democratic front-runner in the presidential race, drew a diverse coalition in the Nevada caucuses Saturday, when
he won
more than half the Latino vote, entrance polls showed.
Mr. Sanders also has spoken favorably about the leftist Sandinistas in Nicaragua in the 1980s and spent his honeymoon in the former Soviet Union in 1988. Such issues surfaced in his 2016 primary contest against Hillary Clinton in Florida, which he lost by 31 percentage points.
The Florida Democratic Party issued a statement that didn't name Mr. Sanders, but noted that party members ""condemn dictators who toppled democracies"" and that ""candidates need to understand our immigrant communities' shared stories.""
Democratic members of Congress from swing districts in Florida
assailed Mr. Sanders's statements
. Rep. Donna Shalala called them ""misguided, ill-informed and unacceptable,"" while Rep. Stephanie Murphy said he ""has consistently taken positions that are wrong on the merits and will alienate many Florida voters.""
Lidia Moore, president of the Miami-Dade Cuban-American Democratic Club, said she was considering supporting Mr. Sanders until his recent remarks. ""It was extremely disappointing to say the least, and hurtful as well,"" she said. ""What's even worse is his refusal to learn from it.""
Not all Miami Latinos took offense. The Facebook page of the Cuban-American Democratic Club is sprinkled with some commenters saying Mr. Sanders's observations were correct.
But the more common reactions have ranged from disappointment to alarm. Democratic strategists said they worry Mr. Sanders would hinder efforts to engage and win over the Florida Hispanic electorate.
""The challenge Sen. Sanders represents is that the narrative shifts onto a frame that puts Democrats on defense in a community where we've made tremendous gains,"" said Christian Ulvert, a Democratic political consultant in Miami who is Nicaraguan-American.
Some federal and state candidates on the Democratic ticket face the possibility that Mr. Sanders's comments could weaken their chances with Hispanic voters.
""As a candidate on the bottom of the ticket…it shoots me in the foot before I have an opportunity to get the community to know me,"" said Ricky Junquera, a Cuban-American Democrat running for state representative in a district that is heavily Hispanic.
Florida Republicans relish the prospect of running against Mr. Sanders. ""He is the best candidate we could have,"" said Ernesto Ackerman, the Republican president of Independent Venezuelan-American Citizens, a civic group. ""Eliminating Sanders will be very easy.""

Sen. Bernie Sanders has taken sole possession of the lead in the Democratic primary race, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds, with four candidates essentially tied for second place amid declining support for former Vice President Joe Biden and the rising profile of Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor.
Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, had 27% support among Democratic primary voters nationally in the new survey, the same as in January. Mr. Biden, who previously had 26%, has dropped 11 percentage points since last month.
Mr. Biden is bunched closely with Mr. Bloomberg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who each have 14% support, and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, with 13%. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has 7%.
The four-way tie for second place shows that Democrats enter their third nominating contest, Saturday's caucuses in Nevada, with the race for the party's political center unsettled.
As in prior surveys, about 40% of Democrats say their top choice is one of the most ardent liberals, Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren, with 45% to 50% picking a more centrist candidate. The difference now is that more candidates are dividing the party's self-described centrist voters, while Mr. Sanders has expanded his lead over Ms. Warren among liberals.
Another sign of the muddle among Democrats: No prior Journal/NBC News poll had found more than three candidates with double-digit support. This month's survey has five.
The new Journal/NBC News survey also finds that President Trump has suffered little political damage, and possibly has gained ground, after the impeachment trial in Congress. Some 47% approve of his job performance, a high mark that he has hit only once before, with 50% disapproving. Approval among independents hit a record 51%.
Among all voters, 53% approve of how Mr. Trump is handling the economy, also a new high. A majority of 51% say the Senate was right to vote against removing Mr. Trump from office in the impeachment trial, with 47% favoring removal.
In a caution signal for Mr. Trump, he trails the leading Democrats in test general-election matchups: Mr. Trump is behind Mr. Biden by 8 percentage points; Mr. Bloomberg by 7 points; Mr. Sanders by 4 points; and Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg by smaller margins.
An unpredictable factor in the Democratic race is the rising profile of Mr. Bloomberg, who entered the contest late and has spent more than $385 million of his personal fortune to introduce himself through TV, radio and web ads, according to ad tracking data from CMAG/Kantar. He is scheduled to appear with other leading candidates on the debate stage Wednesday for the first time.
Amid the scramble for second place, the poll displayed one point of clarity in the Democratic race: Mr. Sanders holds the lead alone. ""Bernie Sanders is the definitive front-runner, and his numbers represent not his ceiling but his base, with room to grow,"" said Democratic pollster Peter Hart.
Mr. Hart noted that 65% of Democratic primary voters say they are enthusiastic about Mr. Sanders's candidacy or comfortable with it -- a larger share than for any other candidate.
""It's a mistake at this stage to say we're looking at his peak, because it just looks to me that as the field narrows, he becomes the beneficiary, especially if Elizabeth Warren drops out,"" said Mr. Hart, who worked on the survey with Jeff Horwitt, also a Democrat, and Republican Bill McInturff.
The survey also showed Mr. Sanders's strength when testing him in hypothetical, two-person races against some of his Democratic rivals. Mr. Sanders topped Mr. Bloomberg in a two-person race, 57% to 37%, and he led Mr. Buttigieg by 16 points, 54% to 38%.
---
The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll was based on nationwide telephone interviews of 900 registered voters. It was conducted Feb. 14-17, 2020, by the polling organizations of Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies and Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates.
The sample was drawn in the following manner: Individuals were randomly selected from national lists of registered voters and were chosen by a systematic procedure to provide a balance of respondents by sex. Respondents reached on their cellphone were randomly selected from national lists of cellphone numbers.
Of the 900 interviews in the weighted data, 495 respondents were reached on a cellphone and screened to ensure that their cellphone was the only phone they had. In addition, 11 respondents were reached on a cellphone but reported also having a landline.
The margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus 3.27 percentage points. Additional interviews were conducted on some questions from a random national sample of Democratic primary voters. For the sample of 428 Democratic primary voters, the margin of error is plus or minus 4.75 percentage points.

WASHINGTON—Sen. Bernie Sanders collected $34.5 million in the fourth quarter, outpacing former Vice President Joe Biden, as both Democratic presidential candidates reported a fundraising surge with one month to go until the Iowa caucuses.
While Democrats brace for a costly—and potentially lengthy—primary season, Republican President Trump faces no significant intraparty opposition and continued to amass campaign cash. His campaign said it raised $46 million in the final three months of last year, its best fundraising quarter to date, and had a war chest of about $103 million.
The Democratic field's quarterly tallies so far more than double Mr. Trump's haul. But unlike the incumbent president, the Democratic hopefuls are entering a period of heavy spending in a primary still crowded with 14 candidates, even after
the exit of former Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development Julián Castro on Thursday.
Mr. Biden said he raised $22.7 million in the fourth quarter, his best number of the year. Mr. Biden, who has relied on larger donors who pay to attend fundraising events, told supporters in a video posted Thursday that his online contributions have increased.
Several other candidates have released their quarterly totals in recent days. Pete Buttigieg, the former South Bend, Ind., mayor, said Wednesday that
he had raised $24.7 million
, while tech entrepreneur and political newcomer Andrew Yang said Thursday that he raised $16.5 million, a sharp increase from the third quarter. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard raised $3.4 million in the fourth quarter, according to her campaign.
Another top contender, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, hasn't disclosed her fourth-quarter haul but said in
a fundraising plea last week
that she had raised $17 million headed into the final days of the quarter, a slowed pace from her third quarter, when she brought in $24.6 million.
None of the Democratic candidates have released their current cash on hand. All presidential campaigns must report fourth-quarter fundraising and spending activities to the Federal Election Commission by Jan. 31.
The Iowa caucuses are Feb. 3, and the New Hampshire primary is Feb. 11. The Democratic field also faces a potential shake-up deeper into the voting calendar, when former New York Mayor
Michael Bloomberg begins competing
in the states that vote March 3, a date known as Super Tuesday. The billionaire businessman entered the race just before Thanksgiving and has already spent $132 million on TV and radio commercials, according to advertising tracker Kantar/CMAG.
Mr. Biden was embarking on a bus tour of eastern Iowa on Thursday, boosted by the endorsement earlier in the day of Rep. Abby Finkenauer (D., Iowa), the first member of the state's congressional delegation to endorse a 2020 candidate. Meanwhile, Mr. Sanders unveiled a new campaign bus and recently increased his TV commercial bookings, according to Kantar/CMAG.
Mr. Sanders's latest haul, which is expected to lead the Democratic pack, is the most that any 2020 Democratic candidate has raised in a single quarter, and highlights the strength of his small-dollar fundraising operation. The Vermont senator has raised about $96 million since entering the race in February, through five million donations that averaged $18, his campaign said.
Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have sworn off events where they woo donors who can give the legal maximum of $2,800. Instead, they are counting on an army of smaller contributors who give online. That is also how Mr. Sanders funded his 2016 bid, when he raised more than $230 million but lost the primary to Hillary Clinton.
Mr. Biden has raised $59.5 million since his late April kickoff. Mr. Biden's campaign said its average contribution amount for the fourth quarter was $41.
Mr. Trump's campaign didn't share information about its average donation size, but he has done well with small online donors in addition to bigger givers. In all, his campaign raised about $143 million last year.
His incumbency enables him to ask individual donors for as much as $360,600 each, money that gets doled out to both his own campaign and to his fundraising partners: the Republican National Committee and state GOP parties. The campaign didn't disclose the joint fundraising totals on Thursday.
The eventual Democratic nominee will also be able to create a bigger-ticket fundraising operation.
Sitting presidents almost always enjoy strong fundraising for re-election. Former President Barack Obama raised about $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, and former President George W. Bush raised $47.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Mr. Bush's campaign had almost $100 million in available cash at the start of his re-election year, the FEC reports show.
Mr. Trump gave himself an advantage by kicking off his re-election campaign the day he was inaugurated. While recent presidents typically have waited until their third year in office to return to the campaign trail, Mr. Trump immediately arranged to fundraise for re-election and never stopped holding the large political rallies that helped him win office in 2016.

It was pretty clear the 2020 presidential election was going to be divisive. Who would have guessed it would contribute to the splintering of one of the most famous political groups in hip-hop history?
On Sunday, Public Enemy, the pioneering rap group, announced it was parting ways with longtime member Flavor Flav. He and
Chuck D, the group's leader
, had been quarreling for some time. Politics played a role. So did money. And now we have another topic on which the nation is split.
Flavor Flav's camp said the star didn't want his likeness used to promote Chuck D's performance at a campaign rally for Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders. Chuck D's defenders say politics has little to do with it, and that Flavor Flav simply won't appear if he isn't paid, which they find anathema to Public Enemy's social-minded mission.
The very public spat has
rap music fans
engaging in a debate of their own—over Flavor Flav and Chuck D,
the legacy of hip-hop's first explicitly political superstar group
and the role of music in politics.
""The situation is indicative of a bigger problem, regarding the growing political divide in this country,"" says James Payton, a 35-year-old information security analyst in Texas, and a fan. Added a user on Twitter: ""Lot of people need to decide: Are you Chuck D or do you want to be Flavor Flav?""
In the 1980s, Public Enemy, which also included Terminator X and Professor Griff, revolutionized hip-hop by making it directly political, including on their landmark 1988 album, ""It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back,"" and songs such as ""Fight the Power.""
Before Public Enemy, many rap artists such as Run-DMC were relatively lighthearted. Public Enemy's protest anthems and militant image were novel and shocking for mainstream audiences. The group entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013 in its first year of eligibility—one of the first hip-hop entrants.
A key ingredient in Public Enemy's sauce was the balance between Chuck D and Flavor Flav, whose jokey ad-libbing and zany presence offset the group's seriousness. In many ways, Flavor Flav's role as ""hype man,"" or sidekick, helped Public Enemy's message spread by broadening the group's appeal.
The disagreement erupted over a Sunday campaign rally in Los Angeles and a performance by Public Enemy Radio, an recent offshoot of Public Enemy that doesn't include Flav. Two days before, Flavor Flav's attorney, Matthew Friedman, issued a cease-and-desist letter to the Sanders campaign, citing the use of Flavor Flav's likeness—and his trademark clock—in promotional materials.
""While Chuck is certainly free to express his political views as he sees fit, his voice alone does not speak for Public Enemy,"" Flav's lawyer said in the letter. In a handwritten note at the bottom of his attorney's letter, Flavor Flav said: ""Hey Bernie, don't do this.""
Chuck D fired back in a response to music-news outlets. ""Flavor chooses to dance for his money and not do benevolent work like this. He has a year to get his act together and get himself straight or he's out.""
Share Your Thoughts
Chuck D or Flavor Flav? Join the conversation below.
Then, right before the Los Angeles rally, Public Enemy issued a written statement that sounded like something that could have come from the White House, saying Flavor Flav was out of Public Enemy altogether. ""We thank him for his years of service,"" the statement said. Public Enemy Radio will be releasing a new album in April.
On Twitter, Chuck D further clarified that the Los Angeles rally wasn't the only cause. ""My last straw was long ago,"" he said. ""It's not about BERNIE and Flav…he don't know the difference between [former NFL running back] Barry Sanders or Bernie Sanders. He don't know either.""
He said Flavor Flav had refused to support other political activities, too. ""If there was a $bag, Flav would've been there front & center. He will NOT do free benefit shows.""
Flavor Flav's attorney responded: ""Flav's willingness to lend his efforts and platform to issues he believes in cannot be questioned,"" and that his only beef was with the marketing. Representatives for the Sanders campaign, Public Enemy and Chuck D couldn't be reached.
Jorge Maestre, 47, who grew up in New York City in the 1980s, says Public Enemy's social mission has been core to their reputation.
""Hip-hop, to that point, was fun, it was braggadocios. [Public Enemy] were the first ones to say, 'Hey, there is more.' "" Flavor Flav's recent projects, including ""Flavor of Love,"" a reality-TV show, suggest he was veering away from the group, says Mr. Maestre, who works in the technology industry.
When he heard the news, ""my immediate reaction was, 'This is long overdue.' ""
Judy Branfman, a 68-year-old filmmaker and activist who attended the Sunday event, says she is not a big follower of Public Enemy or Public Enemy Radio, but she ""loved their message last night for us all to get off our butts,"" adding that the act said this a bit differently.
Ari Melber is the host of ""The Beat with Ari Melber,"" an MSNBC show that covers news, politics and culture and often peppers in hip-hop references. When it comes to politics and music, he said, the bigger question is how much music can galvanize supporters.
As Public Enemy put it, he said, this is ""harder than you think.""

Bernie Sanders says he is running a positive presidential campaign, but some of his aides and supporters are testing those boundaries.
""You didn't see me say a word about any other candidate tonight,"" the Vermont senator said Saturday to a voter who asked him how to avoid Democratic infighting.
On Monday, Mr. Sanders's surrogate Zephyr Teachout, a Fordham University law professor who ran for New York governor in 2014, wrote
an op-ed
for the Guardian, a U.K. newspaper, accusing former Vice President Joe Biden of having ""a big corruption problem"" because he holds fundraisers. Political surrogates are prominent supporters who aim to boost support for the candidate.

Biden and Sanders Fight Over Social Security
(Jan. 18, 2020)
Mr. Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have sworn off big-donor events, which many candidates hold, and rely on small-dollar donations. David Sirota, a top aide to Mr. Sanders, included a link to the op-ed in a campaign newsletter.
Mr. Sanders apologized for the piece in an interview with CBS News Monday: ""It is absolutely not my view that Joe is corrupt in any way. And I'm sorry that that op-ed appeared.""
""Thanks for acknowledging this, Bernie. These kinds of attacks have no place in this primary. Let's all keep our focus on making Donald Trump a one-term president,"" Mr. Biden
tweeted in response
.
Mr. Biden told Iowa's Channel 13 news on Tuesday that Mr. Sanders
had also apologized
to him in person.
It wasn't the first time Mr. Sanders's supporters and surrogates—who have long felt they are fighting the Democratic establishment—have deviated from his preferred handling of his opponents for the party's presidential nomination. As Iowa's leadoff caucuses approach, campaigns are increasingly trading barbs, potentially at the risk of alienating voters whose support they might need to win the nomination.
""Bernie has been clear of what kind of campaign he wants to run, and he's been very vocal about it,"" an aide to Mr. Sanders said, citing his apology for the op-ed and a memo he sent out at the start of his campaign urging surrogates ""to engage respectfully with our Democratic opponents.""
Still, his team has bickered with other Democratic campaigns recently. On Saturday, some of Mr. Sanders's aides criticized Mr. Biden for his stance on Social Security, bringing up a speech he made in 1995 in which he called for freezing ""all government spending, including Social Security."" Mr. Sanders's research director, Tyson Brody, added scissor emojis to Mr. Biden's name in a tweet. Mr. Brody
also tweeted
that a stop sign and scissors meant he didn't want a nominee who supported Social Security cuts.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do Bernie Sanders's supporters affect your impression of him? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
The Biden campaign also criticized a video clip tweeted earlier in the month by a top Sanders adviser that appeared to show Mr. Biden saying that going after Social Security and Medicare was ""the only way you can find room to pay for"" tax cuts. The Biden campaign said he was mocking a Republican leader at the time.
On Tuesday, the fight pulled in the candidates themselves when Mr. Biden released a digital ad
defending his record
on Social Security and vowing to expand it as president. The ad also accused Mr. Sanders's campaign of releasing ""a barrage of negative ads on Joe Biden"" and ""not telling the truth.""
In response, Mr. Sanders released an audio clip that included Mr. Biden talking about his repeated attempts to freeze Social Security and other programs as part of a halt on federal spending.
""Let's be honest, Joe. One of us fought for decades to cut Social Security, and one of us didn't. But don't take it from me. Take it from you,"" Mr. Sanders tweeted with a
link to the video
.
Mr. Sanders's campaign also was reported to have given volunteers talking points that said Ms. Warren wasn't bringing new people into the party, a spat that escalated when Ms. Warren said Mr. Sanders had told her during a 2018 meeting that a woman couldn't beat President Trump. Mr. Sanders didn't dispute that the talking points had been suggested and has denied the account of his discussion with Ms. Warren.
The dispute prompted online backlash against Ms. Warren.
Over a four-day period, more than 25,000 tweets and retweets used snake emojis or the word ""snake"" in reference to Ms. Warren and more than 105,000 tweets or retweets included the hashtag #NeverWarren, according to Plasticity, a social media intelligence company. Some of the tweets came from people who identified themselves as supporters of Mr. Sanders.
Both candidates have
tried to move on
, and in response to questions about the online attacks against Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders's campaign pointed to a tweet from his wife Jane O'Meara Sanders.
""The @BernieSanders campaign is about unifying people across our country—not dividing them up by race, ethnicity or gender. Forget those who are trying to divide us, focus on building the progressive movement & be positive to succeed!#MenWomenUnited,"" she wrote.
Still, some supporters on both sides are angry. Some Warren supporters say the incident brought back memories of sexism toward Hillary Clinton during her race against Mr. Sanders in 2016. Mr. Sanders disavowed any such comments at the time.
""It's disgusting. Look, we don't want that crap,"" Mr. Sanders said in a 2016 CNN interview. ""Anybody who is supporting me that is doing the sexist things is—we don't want them. I don't want that. That is not what this campaign is about.""
Mrs. Clinton, in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter published Tuesday, wasn't ready to let Mr. Sanders or his team off the hook.
""It's not only him, it's the culture around him. It's his leadership team. It's his prominent supporters. It's his online Bernie Bros and their relentless attacks on lots of his competitors, particularly the women,"" Mrs. Clinton was quoted as saying. ""And I really hope people are paying attention to that because it should be worrisome that he has permitted this culture.""
Kelly Dietrich, the founder of the National Democratic Training Committee, which doesn't endorse a candidate, said the actions of Mr. Sanders's staff and supporters could influence undecided primary voters. He said if Mr. Sanders is the nominee, it would be unlikely to hurt him because Democrats want to beat Mr. Trump.
""This kind of stuff doesn't help, but I also don't think it is that large of a factor in most voters' thinking,"" he said. ""They may not line up and be all in 125% with big smiles on their faces, but we're going to work and do whatever needs to be done this election.""

CONCORD, N.H.—New Hampshire voters are casting their ballots in the
nation's first Democratic presidential primary
Tuesday as Sen. Bernie Sanders looks to take the upper hand in the crowded contest for the party's nomination.
Mr. Sanders, who represents neighboring Vermont, has enjoyed the top position in surveys of voters here for weeks. Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., has surged into the second position, riding momentum after the two men virtually tied in
last week's caucuses in Iowa.

The 78-year-old and the 38-year-old—the oldest and youngest candidates in the race—have crisscrossed this small state as Mr. Sanders seeks to claim the first outright victory of the election cycle and Mr. Buttigieg tries to establish himself as a serious contender heading into contests in Nevada and South Carolina later this month.
Both men have begun more urgently to pitch themselves as the strongest candidates to unify a fractured Democratic Party against President Trump in November. Mr. Sanders got a boost Monday with the release of a
Quinnipiac University poll
showing him atop the field nationally, leading former Vice President Joe Biden by 8 percentage points.
The rise of Messrs. Sanders and Buttigieg has put Mr. Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on the defensive as polls in New Hampshire have shown them falling behind.
What to Expect Tuesday
Voters in New Hampshire will turn out for the first-in-the-nation Democratic primary. Here's what to watch:
* Most polls close at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m ET. The Associated Press could project a winner soon after 8 p.m., or it could take longer if the race is very close.
* Sen. Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg are leading in recent state polls, but third place will be closely watched.
* Get
WSJ.com's live updates and analysis
of the primary throughout the day.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who had a
strong debate performance last week
, leapfrogged Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden into the third position in
two late polls
of New Hampshire voters
released Sunday
. Other polls
have shown Ms. Klobuchar in fifth.

Speaking to a packed town hall gathering Monday, Ms. Klobuchar reveled in her polling boost. ""As you've probably heard, we're on a bit of a surge,"" she said to cheers.
In addition to weighing in on the Democratic nomination fight, party officials are hoping the New Hampshire primary, which is handled by state and county officials rather than local party leaders, will go smoothly and wash away some voter anxiety after the bungled Iowa caucuses remain contested a week later.

Mr. Buttigieg won the largest share of state delegates in that contest, the metric the party considers most important, but Mr. Sanders won the raw vote. Both candidates have asked the Iowa Democratic Party to recanvass, or audit, the paperwork from precincts where they thought the results were incorrect.
In the days leading up to Tuesday's primary here, the candidates braved icy and snow-covered roads across New Hampshire to make their final pitches to supporters in school gymnasiums, inns and churches.
In a handful of stops Monday, Mr. Sanders argued his brand of economic populism had broad appeal and made the case that he was the strongest candidate to lead a big-tent party against Mr. Trump. Mr. Sanders touted his ground game, saying his campaign volunteers had knocked on 20% of the doors in New Hampshire in one day.
He went after Mr. Buttigieg repeatedly over his high-dollar fundraisers, accusing him of accepting money from people with agendas, but he stopped someone from booing the former mayor during an event at a coffee shop in Salem.
""No, no, no, he's a good politician. He's a smart guy, but we have our disagreements. Pete seems to think that it doesn't matter, that in his case, he raised lots and lots of money from at least 40 billionaires,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""I think that is naive. Of course it matters.""

Mr. Buttigieg has pitched himself as the candidate most able to unite a Democratic Party split between liberals and moderates as he sought to peel away support from Mr. Sanders and from Mr. Biden.
Appearing in the northern college town of Plymouth, Mr. Buttigieg criticized Mr. Sanders's Medicare for All plan as too expensive and said it would take away Americans' ability to choose private insurance against their wishes.
""This is a moment for bringing as many people as we can into the picture, but a picture where your only choices are a revolution or the status quo is a picture where most of us don't see ourselves,"" Mr. Buttigieg said.
Mr. Biden has sought to reassure his supporters by playing down the significance of Tuesday's primary. His campaign is banking on a strong showing later this month in South Carolina to swing the race back his way going into the 16 contests held March 3, known as Super Tuesday.
His campaign said he would travel to South Carolina on Tuesday to attend a launch party there and would address his New Hampshire supporters through a live stream, a sign he isn't expecting to do well in the primary.
""We're still mildly hopeful here in New Hampshire, and we'll see what happens,"" he told reporters.

Over the weekend, Mr. Biden's campaign released an ad belittling Mr. Buttigieg's mayoral accomplishments, and Mr. Biden made sharp comments on the campaign trail about the former mayor's experience.
Ms. Warren, meanwhile, told reporters Monday that the race remains fluid.
""A lot of people who were supposed to have locked it up by this point are not here,"" she said. ""So I think the prediction business right now is not something I'd be investing heavily in.""
Asked by a reporter Tuesday morning what differentiates her from Mr. Sanders, she pointed to their positions on the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal.
""Bernie said [it's] not good enough, and I said I'll take some help and fight for better. And I think that's a difference,"" Ms. Warren said after emphasizing that she wasn't criticizing Mr. Sanders. ""I don't want to be critical, it's just a difference between how we approach this.""
Around lunchtime Tuesday, a steady stream of voters poured into a polling place at Cawley Middle School in Hooksett.
Tom Benz, a 54-year-old who works for a publishing company, said he decided to vote for Ms. Klobuchar after attending last week's presidential debate, saying she was ""energetic and intelligent, and I think she stands for the right things.""
Mr. Benz said he had considered Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, but he counted their ages against them.
""If you elect another 70- or 80-year-old, the status quo will never change in Washington,"" he said.

DEMOCRATS' WARINESS OF WALL STREET MONEY has complicated the political giving of one of the Street's most prominent M&A lawyers.
H. Rodgin Cohen, chairman of law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, is a prolific Democratic donor, giving to state parties and House, Senate and presidential campaigns. He has donated between $2,500 and $5,600 to six Democratic Senate challengers and four incumbents running for re-election this cycle -- Michigan's Gary Peters, Alabama's Doug Jones, Minnesota's Tina Smith and Virginia's Mark Warner. He has donated to multiple Democratic presidential campaigns, including Joe Biden's and Pete Buttigieg's.
But Buttigieg returned Cohen's donations following a flurry of press about Cohen's Wall Street dealings, which included advising firms at the center of the 2008 financial crisis such as Lehman Brothers and American International Group Inc. (Some candidates, such as Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have been explicit about not accepting any financial-industry donations.)
The campaigns were contacted by the Journal and informed of Cohen's Wall Street history, as well as his 2015 review of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein's personnel file for his company's board, in which Cohen found ""no unresolved claims that could result in liability."" After being asked for comment, the Peters and Jones campaigns said they were each donating $5,000 to nonprofits focused on sexual assault, equivalent to the amount of Cohen's donations.
Weinstein Co.'s board hired Cohen to look at the file after Weinstein's expenses and women's allegations of misconduct came to their attention. Cohen's review of Weinstein preceded the board's decision to renew Weinstein's contract later that year. Weinstein was convicted on sex-crimes charges this week in New York.
Cohen declined to comment. Warner's campaign declined to comment. The Smith and Biden campaigns didn't respond to requests for comment.
TRUST IN AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS faces yet another test with the coronavirus epidemic. Some public-health experts are alarmed at the rhetoric of elected and Trump administration officials relating to the outbreak. Some have presented a rosy outlook for the virus, with White House adviser Larry Kudlow on Tuesday saying the virus is contained, contradicting Centers for Disease Control officials. ""The impulse to mitigate economic harm is not a bad one,"" said Margaret Bourdeaux, research director for Harvard Belfer Center's Security and Global Health Project. ""But you can't PR your way out of a crisis.""
Republican Sen. Tom Cotton and Homeland Security's Ken Cuccinelli have suggested that the virus could have been developed as a biological weapon in a laboratory in Wuhan, China, the epidemic's epicenter. Scientists pushed back in the medical journal Lancet. ""We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,"" they wrote of the virus.
MASSACHUSETTS sees a dogfight ahead of its Super Tuesday primary. Warren's advisers believe they can win her home state, though some have said they expect a competitive race. A recent poll shows Warren and Sanders almost tied in the state, with Buttigieg, Biden and Michael Bloomberg not far behind. Warren received a boost from the Boston Globe on Wednesday, which endorsed her after saying in December 2018 that she shouldn't run.
Sanders makes an overt play for the state with rallies there Friday and Saturday. Buttigieg put staffers on the ground in Massachusetts last week, and Bloomberg opened a Boston suburban field office in Medford, his hometown, with actor Michael Douglas. Sen. Amy Klobuchar has made digital ad investments and aims to pick off delegates in specific congressional districts. Biden still has hopes of winning the state or at least amassing delegates. He has won the support of numerous state party and union leaders.
ANTI-PIPELINE ACTIVISTS aim to push fight against Atlantic Coast Pipeline into public consciousness, like previous battles against Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments Monday on whether to reinstate a construction permit for the pipeline, which would be built through two national forests and the Appalachian Trail. Twelve activists were arrested outside the court as a majority of the justices signaled they are likely to allow the permission process to go forward.
AMERICAN CATHOLICS disapprove of Trump at similar rates as the general population, and most would favor a Democratic challenger over the president in the election, according to a new poll from RealClear Opinion Research and EWTN News, a Catholic broadcast network. Among devout Catholics, who accept all or most of the Church's teachings, Trump's approval ratings are the highest: 63%, with 59% planning to vote for him. The devout Catholics surveyed were 41% Hispanic, which suggests higher support for Trump than the Hispanic population at large, which gave Trump around 28% of their votes in 2016, according to exit polls.

NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C.—Terry Alexander says four years ago, many black Democrats here had never heard of Bernie Sanders.
Mr. Alexander, a state lawmaker, said the Vermont senator told him at the time that he faced an uphill battle against Hillary Clinton in South Carolina's primary, the first in the Democratic nominating calendar where the electorate is majority black. ""It was very obvious,"" Mr. Alexander recalled in a recent interview. ""And no one knew him down here.""
In the days leading up to
South Carolina's 2020 primary Saturday
, Mr. Sanders and his team were confident this time would be different. His name recognition was higher, he had more staff on the ground here, and the race lacked a stable front-runner, with former Vice President Joe Biden struggling in the
first two nominating contests.

But Mr. Sanders lost again here—badly—serving a blow to a candidate who was on the rise and rekindling notions that he will again be unable to pull a large chunk of black voters, a core Democratic constituency, into what he calls his political revolution.
Mr. Sanders's nearly 30-point differential with Mr. Biden was closer than in 2016, when Mr. Sanders lost by 48 points to Mrs. Clinton. He lost black voters by 45 points, according to
exit polls
.
This cycle, the Sanders campaign believed he would narrow the margin in South Carolina. But after Mr. Sanders's strong performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, the campaign saw a path to victory in the state.
Mr. Sanders told reporters traveling with him in mid-February that he had a shot at winning here. The same day, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found Mr. Biden—who had long led the field among black Democrats—had
lost a substantial chunk of that support and was running about even
with Mr. Sanders nationally. Entrance polls in the Nevada caucuses showed Mr. Sanders only about 10 points behind Mr. Biden with black voters there.
Interviews with Mr. Sanders' surrogates, aides and advisers, and black Democrats in South Carolina suggest the Vermont senator made more effort to win the state in 2020 than in 2016. Former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, co-chair of Mr. Sanders's campaign and a prominent surrogate for him in South Carolina during both cycles, said the senator started visiting earlier this time, even before he announced he was running for president.
Mr. Sanders employed roughly 70 staffers throughout the state for the 2020 cycle—double his on-the-ground presence in 2016. State director Michael Wukela described this year's staff as ""significantly more diverse, significantly more from South Carolina"" than the staff Mr. Sanders put here in 2016. This year, some 90% of the staff are from the state, and 83% are nonwhite.
At one field office Wednesday in North Charleston, Victoria Felder, a regional field director, said she saw a sharp increase in volunteers after his strong showings in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. ""It's crazy,"" she said. ""This wasn't what was going on just two months ago.""
Sharnice Williams, a 25-year-old nurse from North Charleston, was raking leaves in her yard a few days before the Saturday primary when a Sanders volunteer approached her and went through the bullet points on Mr. Sanders' plan to cancel all student loan debt.
""I am going to go out there and support Mr. Sanders,"" Ms. Williams said emphatically. Asked by a reporter if she had been considering Mr. Biden, Ms. Williams said she had been. But she changed her mind after hearing about Mr. Sanders's loan-debt forgiveness proposal.
Still, some black voters who didn't support Mr. Sanders said in interviews that they didn't back him because they were looking for a candidate who would provide stability, rather than a revolution. Others worried he was too liberal to win a general election against President Trump. Mr. Biden also has gotten support because of his service as vice president alongside President Obama.
When he held campaign events throughout the state the week before the primary, Mr. Sanders drew mostly white crowds.
Interviews with black voters at Sanders events in the two days leading up to the South Carolina primary found that some were considering backing him, but were still looking at other candidates, particularly Mr. Biden.
Most of Mr. Sanders' black supporters interviewed by the Journal hadn't heard from the Sanders campaign other than receiving emails they had subscribed to. They showed up at his events because they heard about them on the news or through work, not because a volunteer or staffer contacted them.
Fred Brisbane, who is from North Charleston and works in mortuary transportation, said he would vote for Mr. Biden.
""I like the organization,"" Mr. Brisbane, 69, said as he walked into his polling place. He said he respected Ms. Turner and liked that Mr. Sanders had earned her support. ""But I think he's a little too, I guess you could say, liberal for me.""

President Trump's team has been weighing the prospects of a race against a
populist outsider or a party stalwart
. Michigan's Democratic primary may determine just what they get.
The Midwestern battleground, voting on Tuesday, is the first major general election battleground state to hold a primary. Tuesday is the first day Democrats cast a ballot since voters
whittled the race down to two candidates
a week before.
In 2016, President Trump became the first Republican to win Michigan since George H.W. Bush in 1988, eking out a victory over Hillary Clinton that was powered by strong support in white rural areas and benefited from the fact that Mrs. Clinton couldn't match former President Obama's turnout in majority-black districts.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What will you be watching for in the Michigan Democratic primary Tuesday? Join the conversation below.
In that year's Democratic nomination race, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders won the state, and he retains loyal support among young people and liberals. But former Vice President Joe Biden appears to have momentum after
a strong Super Tuesday
that showed him consolidating moderate support, and he has gathered key endorsements in the state.
While Mr. Trump remains confident he can take on either Democrat, his aides and allies have been privately pondering whom they would prefer to compete against in the general election. Some favor the contrast with Mr. Sanders's democratic socialist message—his promise to upend American politics with fundamental overhauls of the health-care and higher education systems and more. Others lean toward Mr. Biden, saying that his decades in government and record of verbal miscues offer rich opportunities for the president.
Each Democrat argues he is best equipped to defeat Mr. Trump. Mr. Sanders says he can bring to the party new voters who support his message of radical political change, while Mr. Biden's allies stress his backing among centrist suburban voters will be critical in November. Recent general election polling of head-to-head matchups with Mr. Trump in Michigan show both Democrats ahead of the president.
For weeks, Mr. Trump and his associates had openly been agitating for Mr. Sanders, with the president seeking to stir up the Vermont senator's supporters by claiming without evidence the Democratic establishment had fixed the race for Mr. Biden. But Trump team's focus turned to Mr. Biden again after Super Tuesday. A key question is whether Mr. Biden can bring back to the Democratic fold voters in the Rust Belt states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which Mr. Trump swept in 2016 to take the White House, as well as compete in historic swing states like Florida.
""I'll tell you, I was all set for Bernie, because I thought it was going to happen,"" Mr. Trump said during a Fox News town hall Thursday. ""In a certain way Bernie would be tougher because he's got a base,"" he said, but added, ""I think it's going to be very hard for him to come back.""
Some Democratic voters in Detroit and its suburbs said they preferred a contest between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden, fearing Mr. Sanders's suite of policy proposals are too far to the left.
""I'm happy with Biden getting stronger. Bernie has a lot of good criticisms to make, but I still feel like in my heart Biden is our best choice,"" said Sara Frank, 69 years old, a retiree from West Bloomfield. ""He would have a broader reach.""
Aaron Parks, 24, who works in the health insurance industry, backed Mr. Sanders in 2016 but this year said he is supporting Mr. Biden. He said when he knocked on doors for Mr. Sanders in Commerce Charter Township four years ago, he found resistance to his liberal policies.
""What I like most about [Mr. Biden] is he's going to resonate with people around here,"" he said.
But Megan Hakala, 31, who works at Wayne State University and lives in Garden City, said if Democrats chose Mr. Biden, Mr. Trump could beat him in Michigan.
""He just doesn't have the passion. I have not met anyone, personally, who is fired up about Biden the way people are fired up about Bernie,"" she said. ""I think that the passion has to be there for the Democratic candidate in order to beat Trump.""
Michigan, which offers 125 delegates to the Democratic convention awarded proportionately, could prove a critical moment in the primary race, either as the state in which Mr. Biden solidifies his march to the nomination or where a strong victory enables Mr. Sanders to remain competitive.
Mr. Sanders has said a loss in Michigan's primary won't force him out of the race, and he has made an aggressive push in Michigan in the final days before the primary, canceling events in other states to add extra stops there. Mr. Biden didn't get to the state until Monday. Later, he is expected to appear with California Sen. Kamala Harris, who
endorsed him Sunday
, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who announced his backing Monday. Meanwhile, Mr. Biden has sent surrogates including Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and has key backers in the state, including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
Heading into Tuesday, Mr. Sanders has begun to criticize Mr. Biden's trade record more forcefully, hitting his support for trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement. His aides feel the criticism resonates with Michigan's large union population and would be a powerful general election argument. They argue Mr. Trump won Michigan and other Midwest states in part because he focused on the trade deals.
""If we are going to defeat Trump in Michigan, in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin it will be very hard for a candidate who voted for these disastrous trade agreements,"" Mr. Sanders said at a rally in Detroit on Friday night. The campaign also released ads targeting Mr. Biden on trade.
Mr. Biden is expected to focus on his record as vice president while trying to avoid a back-and-forth with Mr. Sanders. He likely also will emphasize his role in the 2009 bailout of General Motors Co. and Chrysler, as well as the Affordable Care Act, issues that he would likely continue to stress in a general election. His aides said his strong showing in suburban swing districts on Super Tuesday show he will be competitive in Michigan.
One Biden adviser said, ""Vice President Biden has actually been on two presidential tickets that won Michigan.""
Whichever Democrat wins on Tuesday, the president's campaign said trade will be an issue in the fall. Campaign manager Tim Murtaugh said that Mr. Trump will have an advantage against either, arguing that ""Joe Biden voted for the job-killing Nafta, and Bernie Sanders voted against its much-improved replacement,"" the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA.
The president's campaign—which has pumped resources into Michigan since 2016 to remain competitive—has sought to depict all the Democratic contenders as too far left for many Americans. From the White House on Friday, Mr. Trump made that case against Mr. Biden.
""He's left wing and he's got all people that are left wing. And in many ways, he's worse than Bernie,"" Mr. Trump said.
Mr. Trump also made clear this week that he will continue to raise questions about Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden and their dealings with Ukraine. No evidence has surfaced of any wrongdoing on the part of either Biden, and Mr. Trump was impeached in the Democratic-majority House for pressing the country to announce investigations that would benefit him politically in this year's election, including a probe of the former vice president. He was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate.
""That will be a major issue in the campaign,"" Mr. Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Wednesday, speaking about the Bidens and Ukraine.
Michigan Democrat Michael Frank, 70, a dermatologist from West Bloomfield who is supporting Mr. Biden, said he was worried about Mr. Trump reviving these attacks, but said ""I think there's enough animosity for Trump out there now.""

LAS VEGAS—Joe Biden has made the case for months that he can best appeal to black, Latino and moderate voters. But after the Nevada caucuses, Bernie Sanders is the one beginning to show the makings of a broad electoral coalition.
The Vermont senator's
decisive victory Saturday
was powered by a diverse set of voters, including overwhelming support among Latinos and young people drawn to his calls for an expansive government-run health care program and the elimination of student debt.
Mr. Sanders's ability to build upon that coalition will help dictate whether he is able to prevent the former vice president from notching a victory on Feb. 29 in South Carolina, where
black voters
make up more than half of the Democratic electorate. If Mr. Sanders edges Mr. Biden out there, he could be poised for a dominant run on March 3, when
a series of contests
including the diverse states of California, Texas and North Carolina will award about one-third of the delegates for the nomination.
""In Nevada, we have just put together a multi-generational, multi-racial coalition which is not only going to win in Nevada, it's going to sweep this country,"" Mr. Sanders said in San Antonio on Saturday night.
Mr. Biden took the stage at a Las Vegas union hall as results trickled in, seizing upon projections of a second-place finish—albeit distant—that he said would revitalize his campaign. By Sunday morning, he was at a Baptist church in North Charleston, S.C., opening a weeklong push to win the primary.
Beyond his connection with diverse voters, Mr. Biden's electability pitch has also centered on his ability to persuade suburban voters and disaffected Republicans in general election battleground states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.
Mr. Biden's campaign manager, Greg Schultz, said that despite Mr. Sanders's victories in New Hampshire and Nevada, he had not been able to generate the surges in voting that the senator has promised would help him beat President Trump in the November election.
""Their campaign continues to say, directly and indirectly, look at turnout, look at turnout, look at turnout,"" Mr. Schultz said. ""And in none of the first three contests has there been this surge in turnout in what they think is their greatest asset.""
Nevada's Democratic Party said about 75,000 people voted early ahead of Saturday's primaries, and turnout was expected to surpass the 85,000 who participated in 2016. But it was unclear if it would exceed the 118,000 who caucused in 2008. New Hampshire's turnout was higher than primaries in 2008 and 2016, while Iowa's turnout cleared the 2016 race there but fell short of 2008 numbers.
Entrance polls in Nevada showed Mr. Sanders capturing about half of Hispanic voters and triumphing among those with college degrees and without, union and non-union households and every age group except those age 65 and older, who supported Mr. Biden. The former vice president was backed by about one third of African-American voters, giving him an edge over Mr. Sanders, who was backed by about one quarter of black voters.
Maria Cardona, a Democratic strategist who isn't affiliated with a presidential campaign, credited Mr. Sanders with cultivating strong ties with the Latino community since the 2016 election, particularly among young people and millennials. She noted that since the last election, four million Latinos have turned age 18, giving Mr. Sanders a significant advantage that he could take into a general election.
""Sanders has done a really good job of transforming the electability argument. And the pendulum is swinging toward him right now,"" she said.
Mr. Biden's message focuses on protecting the Obamacare health care law he helped pass alongside President Obama and his work to curb gun violence.
Both issues sought to draw bright lines with Mr. Sanders, who has advocated for a Medicare-for-all health care overhaul that would eventually eliminate the private insurance system and who voted against legislation to institute background checks for gun purchases.
Days before the caucuses, Mr. Biden delivered a speech that emphasized Mr. Sanders's past support for providing gun manufacturers with protections from lawsuits, a position that the Vermont senator has since recanted.
After crippling losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, Mr. Biden will try to use his second-place finish in Nevada to help convince voters in South Carolina that he can serve as a more moderate alternative to Mr. Sanders.
South Carolina has long been viewed as a firewall for the Biden campaign. Depending on his performance, it could serve as a springboard into delegate-rich states or Mr. Biden's political Waterloo as he seeks the presidency for the third time.
""I think he does have momentum,"" Mr. Biden said of Mr. Sanders after attending church services Sunday in predominantly black North Charleston, S.C. But he added: ""Whoever wins this primary is going into Super Tuesday very strongly, and I think it's going to be Bernie and me going into Super Tuesday.""

Joe Biden triumphed in the key state of Michigan, while also winning in Missouri, Mississippi and Idaho, as he built his delegate lead over Bernie Sanders with a coalition of African-Americans, suburbanites and older voters in Tuesday's round of Democratic presidential nominating contests.
Opening a new phase in the race, the former vice president put distance between himself and Mr. Sanders—and built upon his momentum from
wins in 10 Super Tuesday states
last week. Mr. Biden quickly sought to unite the party after prevailing in Michigan, which offered 125 delegates, the biggest prize of the night. The results in Washington, the second-biggest delegate haul of the day, were too close to call. North Dakota was also holding a contest.
""I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion,"" Mr. Biden said in remarks at Philadelphia's National Constitution Center. ""We share a common goal and, together, we'll defeat Donald Trump; we'll defeat him together.""
Mr. Biden has presented himself as the Democrat best able to challenge President Trump in general election battlegrounds such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, which was the first of those states to weigh in on the Democratic race. His win there, by one measure, is his most significant yet and could allow him to argue that he should be the party's nominee. With about 64% of precincts reporting, Mr. Biden had about 53% of the vote to about 38% for Mr. Sanders. The Vermont senator narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton in the state in the 2016 nominating contest.
Mr. Biden was projected the winner in Mississippi, Missouri and Michigan shortly after the states' polls closed, an early sign of his clout in three states with large African-American voting blocs. Black voters made up about two-thirds of the electorate in Mississippi, exit polls showed. Mr. Biden had won more than 80% of support in the state, with about 89% of precincts reporting.
The former vice president campaigned ahead of the Missouri primary among African-Americans in St. Louis and Kansas City. With about 93% of precincts reporting, Mr. Biden had about 60% of the vote in Missouri.
Mr. Sanders returned to his home in Burlington, Vt., and did not speak publicly after the election results. A campaign aide said he intended to participate in Sunday's debate in Phoenix.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a top Sanders surrogate, expressed disappointment as the election results streamed in. ""There's no sugar-coating it. Tonight's a tough night. Tonight's a tough night for the movement overall,"" Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said on Instagram.
Mr. Biden entered Tuesday with a delegate edge of 670 to 574 over Mr. Sanders, according to
a Wall Street Journal delegate tracker
, even as Super Tuesday states such as California and Colorado, which Mr. Sanders carried, continue to process election results.
Mr. Sanders sought to steady his campaign on Tuesday. Moderates in the Democratic Party rapidly
coalesced around Mr. Biden
after he won South Carolina's primary last month. Some in the party's establishment have expressed fears that Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who won the New Hampshire and Nevada contests, would be too liberal for many voters in the general election.
The campaigns competed for votes against the backdrop of
growing economic concerns
over
the spread of the coronavirus
. Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden both canceled rallies in Cleveland Tuesday, ahead of Ohio's primary next week, citing public health concerns. Both candidates have
questioned Mr. Trump's handling of the crisis
in recent days.
Exit polls coming in with the results showed Mr. Biden winning handily among black and older voters and performing well with those who had at least a college degree. Mr. Biden was also prevailing in cities such as St. Louis, Kansas City and Detroit and in their surrounding suburban areas—including Oakland County, Mich., a key general election battleground.
Mr. Sanders maintained a substantial advantage over Mr. Biden among young voters, exit polls showed. The Vermont senator staked much of his campaign on motivating the young, and others disenchanted with current politics, to come to the polls.
Mr. Biden, while campaigning in Michigan, spoke of the Obama administration's bailout of General Motors and Chrysler, two titans of the state's auto industry, more than a decade ago.
""We bet on you,"" Mr. Biden said during a visit to a Fiat Chrysler assembly plant in Detroit earlier Tuesday. ""If I end up being the president, you'll never have a better friend in the White House.""
During a Detroit rally on the eve of the primary, Mr. Biden was joined by California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, two former presidential rivals who recently endorsed Mr. Biden's candidacy. The pair—who have been discussed by some Democrats as potential running mates for Mr. Biden if he wins the nomination—sought to help him appeal to black voters in the state.
Mr. Sanders courted voters at a Dearborn Heights, Mich., polling place on Tuesday, repeating criticisms he has raised about Mr. Biden's record, including the former Delaware senator's past support for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Mr. Sanders told reporters that was ""obviously a very important state"" but that he thinks every state is important to try to win. Last week, his campaign dispatched top aides to Michigan, including some who oversaw his Iowa caucus efforts.
""When our record is compared to Biden's, when our vision is compared to Biden's, when we have that debate in Phoenix, I'm feeling pretty good,"" Mr. Sanders said, referring to Sunday's
primary debate in Arizona
.
Tuesday's nominating contest served as the first opportunity for voters to consider a one-on-one choice between Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii) was still seeking the nomination but has been unable to break out of single-digit polling.
Mr. Biden has largely sought to avoid confrontation with Mr. Sanders as he attempts to build support in the party.
The former vice president mostly has only mentioned his opponent to point out that he himself has driven up turnout in primaries so far, not Mr. Sanders. Mr. Biden has argued that he is bringing African-Americans and white blue-collar workers into his coalition.
""Sen. Sanders likes to say, 'We need a record turnout to beat Donald Trump.' He's absolutely right,"" Mr. Biden has told audiences in recent days, rattling off statistics from Super Tuesday showing a turnout boost in states such as Virginia, Texas and North Carolina.
""Guess who they voted for? They voted for us,"" Mr. Biden said.

DES MOINES, Iowa—After a day of confusion and recriminations over a
technical mishap that snarled the vote count
, the first wave of delayed results from
Iowa's presidential caucuses
showed Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders at the top of the Democratic pack.
The early numbers, representing nearly three-quarters of precincts, suggested a possible split verdict that could have one candidate winning the popular vote and another securing the most delegates, the measure state and national party officials have said should determine the victor.
A close finish between Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, would also underscore the larger Democratic primary battle between progressives and more-moderate candidates in a field still totaling close to a dozen.
More broadly, the muddled results and fallout from the chaotic count stoked tensions among the candidates and concerns among party officials that the process is doing little to find a strong nominee who can unite the party.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, a longtime front-runner who has built his campaign on the idea that he is that candidate, appeared headed for a
worse-than-expected finish
. He is competing with Mr. Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota among the more moderate candidates, and the Iowa results suggest he was beaten by someone in Mr. Buttigieg who was barely known a year ago and who has never governed anything larger than a city of about 100,000 people.

Full Results

The moderate contenders also face a growing challenge from billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who wasn't on the ballot but who has risen in polls after spending several hundred million dollars on advertising. He said on Tuesday that he would
further step up spending and hiring.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, representing the more liberal wing of the party, was below Mr. Buttigieg in the early results but above Mr. Biden.
Ms. Klobuchar, who frequently says on the campaign trail that she has never lost an election since fourth grade, appeared headed for a fifth-place finish in Iowa.
Though the state's population is small and not very diverse, Iowa's caucuses have had a reasonably good record in recent history of picking the eventual winner of the Democratic nomination: Al Gore in 2000, John Kerry in 2004, Barack Obama in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. The caucuses have been less predictive among Republicans in recent election cycles.
There are indications the Democratic Party is unlikely to resolve its debate over candidates and vision soon. All four of the top candidates heading into the caucuses had campaign war chests large enough to sustain them through February, including the
New Hampshire primary next week.

A self-described democratic socialist, Mr. Sanders has recently shown strength in national polls. That has triggered concerns among centrist Democrats who worry President Trump, a Republican, would use Mr. Sanders's political identity to damage the party's prospects in November.
The release of the results followed a brief news conference Tuesday afternoon with Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price, who said the nearly- one-day delay for even partial results was unacceptable and happened because of ""multiple reporting challenges"" as about 1,700 precincts began to feed results into state party headquarters.
Mr. Price declined to say when all of the state's results would be made public. ""We're going to take the time we need,"" he said.
The state party is collecting paper records completed during the precinct meetings. It has attributed the holdup to a software glitch that triggered inconsistencies in data obtained from a mobile app used to report vote tallies.
""We know this data is accurate,"" Mr. Price said. ""We also have a paper trail.""
With 71% of precincts reporting, Mr. Buttigieg had the largest share of delegates to the state party convention, while Mr. Sanders had the second most. But Mr. Sanders led in the raw vote so far, followed by Mr. Buttigieg.
Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden were third and fourth, respectively, in both counts.
Mr. Buttigieg, a 38-year-old openly gay man who is the youngest in the race, could see a bump following what appears to be the best showing of any moderate. He has positioned himself as a voice for generational change—most of his top opponents are septuagenarians—who is willing to work across the political aisle.
In New Hampshire, Mr. Buttigieg has also recorded strong support in polls, but he faces a stiffer challenge in the more ethnically diverse states of Nevada and South Carolina this month, as he has so far received virtually no support in polls from black and Latino voters.
The muddled reporting gave all the top candidates room to frame the result as a win. Speaking to reporters Tuesday evening in New Hampshire after the release of some Iowa results, Mr. Buttigieg was asked what it would mean to his candidacy if he ends up finishing in second or third place. ""It still amounts to an astonishing victory for our vision,"" he said.
In a statement, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders called the early numbers gratifying. ""In the partial data released so far, it's clear that in the first and second round more people voted for Bernie than any other candidate in the field,"" Jeff Weaver said.
Ms. Warren said at her first New Hampshire event on Tuesday, ""We know that three of us will be dividing up most of the delegates coming out of Iowa. I'm feeling good.""

Mr. Biden, during an appearance in Nashua, N.H., expressed optimism after arriving from Iowa. ""It's like my mother said, 'Hope springs eternal,'"" Mr. Biden said. ""We're not giving up.""
State party officials in Nevada, where the second caucus of the nominating season will be held, on Feb. 22, pledged that they wouldn't experience the same failures as Iowa.
""We will not be employing the same app or vendor used in the Iowa caucus,"" Nevada State Democratic Party Chair William McCurdy said in a statement. ""We had already developed a series of backups and redundant reporting systems, and are currently evaluating the best path forward.""
Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said the app that misfired in Iowa wouldn't be used in any other state, either.
""What happened last night should never happen again,"" Mr. Perez said. ""We have staff working around the clock to assist the Iowa Democratic Party to ensure that all votes are counted.""

Do you expect either Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders to have an advantage in the New Hampshire primary? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
Meanwhile, Mr. Trump pounced on the uncertainty, calling the Democratic caucuses an ""unmitigated disaster"" in a Tuesday morning tweet, ahead of his State of the Union address that evening.
The reporting was complicated in this year's caucuses by additional data. In response to calls for greater transparency following the close 2016 contest between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton, the state party was to release for the first time the raw total for votes from both rounds of voting, along with the traditional share of delegates won.
Mr. Sanders has been ahead of his rivals in recent state polls in New Hampshire, but Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg have been within striking distance.
New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley said it is ""highly unusual to have at this point so many competitive campaigns. Usually we are down to three at the most.""

LOS ANGELES—The workers represented by Rachel Sulkes's union had reached an impasse in negotiations with food-services provider Sodexo. So Ms. Sulkes and her team turned to the 2020 field, announcing in mid-December that the union would picket outside the coming Democratic debate at Loyola Marymount University.
Candidates reacted quickly, surprising Ms. Sulkes and union leaders during a morning meeting. By the end of the day, all seven candidates who were set to appear said they would
skip the debate
rather than cross Unite Here Local 11's picket line. The Democratic National Committee stepped in, helping
broker a labor agreement
a few days later that included pay increases and better job security.
""People who we didn't necessarily expect or assume would basically say they would not cross a picket line, even if it meant they would not appear on stage,"" said Ms. Sulkes, the communications director for the union, which represents more than 30,000 hospitality workers in Arizona and Southern California. ""It just took off in a way that I don't think any of us anticipated at all.""
The deal underscored the influence that labor unions have achieved this year as candidates in a large Democratic field seek ways to distinguish themselves in a tight race for the party's presidential nomination.
Unlike the 2016 primary campaign, at this point many of the nation's largest and medium-size unions haven't yet issued endorsements, though some locals have embraced candidates. The share of American workers in unions
hit a record low of 10.3% last year
, but labor is nonetheless a significant player in the Democratic Party.
The Democratic candidates have taken dozens of actions to appeal to unions, including appearing on picket lines in the Boston area to support striking workers at Stop & Shop groceries; in Iowa with McDonald's workers; and in Michigan with members of the United Auto Workers. They have also called workers on strike to offer support and attended labor forums.
Former Vice President Joe Biden's first campaign rally was held at a Teamsters hall in Pittsburgh, while Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's formal announcement came at a former textile mill in Lawrence, Mass., the site of the 1912 Bread and Roses strike.
""The numbers remain grim for labor in terms of membership, but the political clout of unions is considerable,"" said Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has studied labor relations.
Labor unions largely sided with Hillary Clinton during the 2016 primaries. Those decisions alienated some workers who supported Bernie Sanders, and more than a third of union households voted for President Trump in the general election, according to the Cooperative Congressional Election Study. Unions have been slower to endorse in the 2020 primary.
By mid-November 2015, Mrs. Clinton had secured endorsements from four of the nation's largest unions: the Service Employees International Union, the American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
None of those unions have made an endorsement yet. And many are asking the candidates to do more to earn their support.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do you think a union endorsement would help or hurt a Democratic candidate? Why? Join the conversation below.
The Teamsters didn't endorse Mrs. Clinton until after she became the Democratic nominee, and this cycle they have no timeline for a decision, despite an expanded endorsement process. General President James P. Hoffa said the candidates need to make the case to working-class voters, many of whom supported President Trump in 2016.
He said he has been contacted personally by most of the candidates who have been asking: ""How are we doing? Are we saying the right things?""
The effort matters, Mr. Hoffa said, because Mrs. Clinton ""made a mistake by not talking about issues that concerned the average person in the United States.""
Mary Kay Henry, SEIU's president, said the union has urged candidates to shadow members at the workplace. Ms. Warren met a child-care worker in San Jose, Calif., in December, while Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders talked to food-services attendants at a Pittsburgh hospital.
""For us, it's decisive. It's a way they get considered, and if they don't, they're taken off the list,"" Ms. Henry said.
SEIU's executive board plans to discuss its presidential endorsement process at a meeting later this month in San Diego.
April Verrett, president of SEIU Local 2015, California's largest labor union representing about 400,000 home health care workers, said each local has its own process to engage members. Her union's presidential advisory committee informs her of members' preferences and helps shape how she represents the union in any endorsement discussions.
Other unions, like the Teamsters, are requiring candidates to join workers on picket lines or in other actions to be considered for an endorsement.
Afscme, which played an influential role in President Bill Clinton's campaigns, is holding an event in Des Moines on Feb. 1 ahead of the Iowa Democratic caucuses and is planning a similar meeting in Nevada, before the third presidential nominating contest on Feb. 22.
But Lee Saunders, the union's president, said it is ""in no rush"" to endorse a candidate.
AFT held a forum for the leading presidential contenders, and President Randi Weingarten said members have been able to shape the race through their interactions with candidates. But she said the union doesn't plan to endorse a candidate before the Iowa caucuses.
Perhaps the most closely watched union in 2020 is Culinary Workers Union Local 226, the most powerful union in Nevada representing about 60,000 hospitality workers.
The union is likely to discuss whether to endorse at a general executive board meeting later this month with leadership of Unite Here, its umbrella organization, said Secretary-Treasurer Geoconda Argüello-Kline. The union has hosted town halls at its headquarters in Las Vegas with six current candidates and hundreds of union members in attendance.
All of the major candidates have sought labor support, but state and local unions have largely sided with Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren.
Mr. Sanders received the endorsement of the National Nurses United, a union of 150,000 members that also endorsed him in 2016, while Ms. Warren has won support from teachers' unions from Massachusetts. The National Union of Healthcare Workers, a union of 15,000 members, endorsed both of them.
Mr. Biden received the support of the International Association of Fire Fighters and was endorsed Wednesday by the Iron Workers union, which represents about 130,000 members.
Harold Schaitberger, the general president of the firefighters union, said it planned to mobilize 2,600 members in Iowa for the caucuses and was encouraging its Republican members to change their voter registration so they could caucus for Mr. Biden.
""We're using every opportunity we can to expand our presence in those caucuses,"" Mr. Schaitberger said.

If history is any guide, the 2020 election year may not bode particularly well for stocks in the health-care or technology sectors.
But the S&P 500 as a whole may do just fine.
The health-care and technology segments of the S&P 500 typically suffer their worst performance of the four-year election cycle during the years Americans go to the polls to name a president.
That is according to an analysis of sector performance by Dow Jones Market Data going back to each sector's inception. The S&P 500 data go back to 1928, the year in which Republican Herbert Hoover won the presidency by defeating Democrat Al Smith.
The broader market, on the other hand, has averaged its best performance in the year before elections, followed by the year in which voters pick a new occupant for the White House.
This year, the outlook for stocks is bolstered by an economy that is marching along as well as by
recent progress
on
trade agreements
, said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group.
""That should clear the decks for markets to do quite well throughout this year,"" he said.
Last year's standout S&P 500
advance of 29%
—its best showing since 2013—fit the historical trend and beat the average gain of 13.5% in pre-election years. Investment-bank strategists
expect more modest results
in 2020. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., for one, predicts the index will end the year at 3400, which would mark a 5.2% rise. Its average gain in election years is 9.1%.
As far as the historical election-year laggards: The health-care sector has received particular attention from investors during the current presidential campaign, with some Democratic candidates proposing major changes to how Americans get health insurance.
Bernie Sanders has
proposed a Medicare-for-All plan
that would move every American to a government-run health-insurance plan, even if they have insurance through their employer. Elizabeth Warren has endorsed a similar approach.
Although health-care stocks often are considered defensive investments—demand for health care doesn't generally fluctuate with the economy—they can be vulnerable to changes in government policy.
Health-care stocks were the next-to-worst performing sector in the S&P 500 in 2019, after energy. Some analysts pegged their trajectory to the progressive Democrats' rise and fall in the polls. So far in 2020, the shares are slightly underperforming the broader market, rising 2.5% versus a gain of 2.8% by the S&P 500. Their average gain in election years is 7.9%
Technology stocks, on the other hand, had a standout year in 2019, surging 48%. They continue to lead the S&P 500 so far in 2020, with a gain of 5.8%—slightly ahead of the average increase of 5% in election years.
Shares of technology companies have powered the decadelong bull market, with investors putting their money behind rapidly growing enterprises that many expect will outperform the broader economy. That is even as big tech companies
face antitrust probes and controversies
over their handling of user data.

Those concerns, combined with the relative priciness of technology stocks, could pose risks for the sector in 2020, Mr. Cox said.
""It could be this year tech is beaten up by candidates more than health care,"" he said.
In contrast, three sectors have had their best average performance in presidential-election years: financials, utilities and energy. Those are generally considered slower-growing companies. Financial and energy shares are often categorized as value stocks, or those with a low price-to-book value, while utilities are deemed safety stocks because of their high dividend yields.
DJMD's sector analysis excludes returns from 2008, when the S&P 500 suffered an outsize decline of 38% in the depths of the financial crisis. When including performance from that year, seven of the 11 sectors in the index average their weakest performance during presidential-election years.

The end of Sen. Elizabeth Warren's presidential
campaign last week
has left her New York supporters saddened and searching for the next steps as the Democratic field narrows to two major candidates.
Ms. Warren said Thursday that she was suspending her campaign after a lackluster showing in the Super Tuesday primaries. She wasn't victorious in any of the 14 voting states, and finished third in her home state of Massachusetts behind former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, of Vermont.
Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders had been
competing in a side-primary
among the state's progressive officials and institutions. The Working Families Party endorsed Ms. Warren. Some of Mr. Sanders's staunchest supporters, like him, identify as democratic socialists and are active in the Democratic Socialists of America.
By one measure, the WFP and DSA are vying for primacy in progressive circles and the WFP's endorsement of Ms. Warren over Mr. Sanders was off-putting to some voters. Several Sanders supporters vented online after the WFP announced its decision in September.
Most of the people interviewed for this column, though, said they believed any row would quickly be smoothed over.
""Both Warren and Sanders will have important roles in the future of the progressive movement, so I wouldn't say the WFP's out. But there are groups like DSA that will use this to help recruit,"" said Sean McElwee, a DSA member who backs Mr. Sanders and is the executive director of Data for Progress, a progressive think tank.
WFP National Director Maurice Mitchell said in an interview that the party is ""a coalition of progressives, some of which were Bernie supporters and Warren supporters"" and the relationships among them remain ""very, very strong.""
""We think that our record speaks for itself. We point to the work we're doing every single day on really, really, really big issues,"" he said, including races for the New York state Legislature and Congress.
Mr. Mitchell wouldn't say what the party's next step would be, but was clear that ""now is a time for progressives to unite."" Some prominent supporters of Ms. Warren, including New York City Councilman Brad Lander, have already endorsed Mr. Sanders.
But others, like Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou, a Democrat who represents lower Manhattan, are waiting.
""I want to think about what's good for all of us, but right now—I'm in mourning,"" she said.
CUOMO STILL NOT ENDORSING BIDEN: Gov. Andrew Cuomo is so far declining to join moderate Democrats around the country who coalesced behind Mr. Biden after his
strong performance on Super Tuesday
.
Mr. Cuomo, who is Mr. Biden's longtime friend, has been a fair-weather ally during this primary season. When the former vice president first declared his candidacy, Mr. Cuomo said Mr. Biden was the best candidate to defeat President Trump, and people close to the governor said he would do
whatever he could
to help the Biden campaign.
But after some lackluster debate performances, Mr. Cuomo answered questions about Mr. Biden by saying he hadn't endorsed anyone for president. Between the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primaries, Mr. Cuomo demurred when asked if he still believed Mr. Biden was the Democrats' best bet to defeat Mr. Trump.
During a Thursday press conference on the new coronavirus, a reporter asked Mr. Cuomo when he would be ready to endorse Mr. Biden.
""When will I be ready to endorse Joe Biden? So, are you assuming that I will endorse Joe Biden?"" the governor replied.
Some reporters nodded. One retorted, ""So you're considering endorsing Bernie Sanders?"" The comment drew laughs around the room and a smile from Mr. Cuomo, who has said Mr. Sanders's identification as a democratic socialist would be
""a pretty big pill""
for voters to swallow.
""Good comeback,"" Mr. Cuomo said. ""No politics today.""
THE QUESTION: The State Capitol in Albany features carvings and stained glass representing famous New Yorkers, the state's major crops and the seal of which defunct city?
—Know the answer? Leave a comment!
THE LAST ANSWER: Assemblyman Marcos Crespo, a Bronx Democrat who said last month he wouldn't seek re-election in November, started his political career as an intern for the Rev. Ruben Diaz Sr. The reverend is a former state senator who is now a member of the New York City Council and a candidate for Congress.

MODERATE DEMOCRATS SEARCH for alternative to Sen. Bernie Sanders as he rises in the polls. Some party officials and independent expenditure groups focused on down-ballot races worry he
could arrest the Democratic suburban expansion
. The nightmare scenario involves falling short in the bet that Sanders's populist credentials can win back the Rust Belt, while also losing some of the front-line suburban districts won by Democrats in 2018. Sanders's rivals have been playing up their ability to win there: ""I bring the receipts of bringing in people in the suburbs,"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar said this week, while former Vice President Joe Biden noted his success campaigning for suburban candidates in the 2018 midterms.
But Sanders

has received the most donations from suburban women
of any Democratic candidate, according to a November 2019 analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics. Sanders's campaign didn't respond to requests for comment.
The party's donor class continues to search for their ideal candidate. Dozens of corporate lawyers from across the country gathered in Manhattan earlier this week in support of former Mayor Mike Bloomberg's presidential campaign. The lawyers, many of whom previously supported Sen. Kamala Harris, weren't there to donate. Instead, they were there to learn more about Bloomberg's candidacy, talk about why they support him and strategize how to get the word out to their colleagues.
Following a Republican win in a special state legislature election in suburban Houston, GOP strategist Karl Rove said a playbook was emerging for 2020: ""A focus on bread-and-butter suburban issues and a focus on what national Democrats are doing.""
WILD WEST: West Virginia makes a pitch to conservative counties in Virginia to switch states. ""If you're not truly happy where you are, we stand with open arms to take you from Virginia,"" West Virginia GOP Gov. Jim Justice said at
a Tuesday press conference
with evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr. He noted that West Virginia had become a state because Virginia's government was ""out of touch"" with the values of its people during the Civil War era.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How would nominating Bernie Sanders affect Democrats' chances in 2020? Join the conversation below.
Falwell said that what was happening in Virginia was a ""tragedy"" because of Democratic control of the state. ""We need a government that is not elected by federal workers in the suburbs of Washington, D.C.,"" Falwell said. As for the chances of the plan, Falwell said, ""it's a long shot.""
KIRKLAND & ELLIS alumni are robustly represented in the impeachment drama. The nation's largest law firm formerly employed three of President's Trump's lawyers, including lead counsel Pat Cipollone, Deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin and Clinton impeachment veteran Kenneth Starr. Attorney General Bill Barr and former national security adviser John Bolton, who is at the center of the debate over having witnesses at the trial, spent much of the Obama years there.
Along with fellow Trump lawyer Alan Dershowitz, Starr defended Kirkland client Jeffrey Epstein against sex crimes accusations in the mid-2000s. That defense ultimately led to a nonprosecution agreement for Epstein with Alex Acosta, who was then a U.S. attorney and a Kirkland alumnus. Acosta resigned his post as Trump's labor secretary after new charges were brought against Epstein last year.
DEMOCRATIC FUNDRAISING in state races continues to lag behind that of Republicans, despite rosy news for House and Senate candidates. An analysis by Democratic group Forward Majority shows that in the 20 most competitive statehouse pickup targets in Texas, Democrats have raised just 47% of what their Republican counterparts have raised. In Florida, Democrats have been outraised by a factor of over 6-1. Outside groups attempt to fill the gap: Bloomberg-backed Everytown for Gun Safety announced a plan this week to spend $60 million on the 2020 elections, focusing on races from state legislatures to the presidency.
CORONAVIRUS FEARS spread to Washington. The Chinese Embassy canceled its Lunar New Year party scheduled for Thursday because of the epidemic. Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai managed to keep some of his holiday season schedule from going off the rails,
introducing the Shanghai Chinese Orchestra at the Kennedy Center
last Wednesday before lighting up traditional winter lanterns.
DEMOCRATIC VOTERS show fatigue with the impeachment process. In a new WSJ/NBC News Poll, 51% of Democratic voters say the party should focus on making the case that Trump should be defeated in November, compared to 41% who think the party should focus on impeaching and removing the president from office. Last month, the two positions were virtually tied.
MINOR MEMOS: Unimpressed by food options provided by fellow Senate Democrats, Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota brings brown bag lunch to the impeachment trial. … Democratic impeachment manager Rep. Sylvia Garcia assures that ""some crimes, like jaywalking, are not impeachable."" … Sen. Roy Blunt accidentally offers impeachment question with former Sen. Claire McCaskill before correcting with Sen. Martha McSally.

Politics pose a significant risk to U.S. health-care stocks. Investors should look past it.
Sen. Bernie Sanders has gained ground in the Democratic presidential race and is now tied with former Vice President Joe Biden among the party's primary voters nationally, according to a recent
Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll
. Sen. Elizabeth Warren is in third place.
Sen. Sanders has proposed a dramatic overhaul of the U.S. health-care system known as Medicare for All. He could possibly gather more steam with a strong showing in Monday's Iowa caucus.
Recent history suggests that could be a problem for Wall Street. Indeed, his gathering strength, coupled with general market weakness, pushed a broad index of health-care stocks 2% lower on Friday.
Some muscle memory is likely at work here. Biotechnology stocks plunged ahead of the 2016 election, once politicians began to publicly scrutinize high drug prices.
And health-care spending is a big target: It amounts to roughly 18% of gross domestic product, while health-care companies represent about 14% of the S&P 500.
Health policy under current law is highly favorable for companies; the Affordable Care Act expanded access to care without instituting meaningful cost controls. So investors aren't likely to welcome major policy changes and can't ignore the possibility of them.
However, a closer look suggests any politics-fueled selloff will present a buying opportunity.
The reason? Current polling likely overstates the true probability that Medicare for All becomes law soon.
And investors shouldn't overreact to the Iowa Caucus results. The more important date comes a month from now: 14 states, including California and Texas, will hold a Democratic primary on March 3.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How do you think the markets would react were Bernie Sanders to win the Democratic nomination? Join the conversation below.
Even in a scenario where a Medicare for All advocate wins the nomination, and even the presidency, overhauling health policy isn't realistic without Congress on board. Building consensus among lawmakers and other stakeholders won't happen overnight.
Insurers, drug manufacturers and other companies likely to be affected by any overhaul employ a host of lawyers and lobbyists and can be expected to fight new laws in court.
Of course, even the prospect of change can affect stock prices as investors build in even the outside chance of an overhaul. But investors, too, shouldn't forget the sector's current
fundamentals are strong
.
Nearly halfway through fourth-quarter earnings season, sales at S&P 500 health-care companies are projected to increase nearly 11% from a year ago, according to FactSet. That tops every other sector. Health-care earnings per share are forecast to grow by more than 6%, while the overall index is expected to report flat profits.
That growth comes at a reasonable valuation: The sector trades at less than 16 times forward earnings, while the market goes for about 18 times.
If health stocks take a turn for the worse after the Iowa caucus, better to bet on a recovery.

DES MOINES, Iowa -- After a day of confusion and recriminations over a technical mishap that snarled the vote count, the first wave of delayed results from Iowa's presidential caucuses showed Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders at the top of the Democratic pack.
The early numbers, representing nearly three-quarters of precincts, suggested a possible split verdict that could have one candidate winning the popular vote and another securing the most delegates, the measure state and national party officials have said should determine the victor.
A close finish between Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, also would underscore the larger Democratic primary battle between progressives and more moderate candidates in a field still totaling close to a dozen.
More broadly, the muddled results and fallout from the chaotic count stoked tensions among the candidates and concerns among party officials that the process is doing little to find a strong nominee who can unite the party.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, a longtime front-runner who has built his campaign on the idea that he is that candidate, appeared headed for a worse-than-expected finish. He is competing with Mr. Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota among the more moderate candidates, and the Iowa results suggest he was beaten by Mr. Buttigieg who was barely known a year ago and who has never governed anything larger than a city of about 100,000 people.
The moderate contenders also face a growing challenge from billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who wasn't on the ballot but who has risen in polls after spending several hundred million dollars on advertising. Mr. Bloomberg said on Tuesday that he would further step up spending and hiring.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, representing the more liberal wing of the party, was below Mr. Buttigieg in the early results but above Mr. Biden.
Ms. Klobuchar, who frequently says on the campaign trail that she has never lost an election since fourth grade, appeared headed for a fifth-place finish in Iowa.
Though the state's population is small and not very diverse, Iowa's caucuses have had a reasonably good record in recent history of picking the eventual winner of the Democratic nomination: Al Gore in 2000, John Kerry in 2004, Barack Obama in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016.
The caucuses have been less predictive among Republicans in recent election cycles.
There are indications the Democratic Party is unlikely to resolve its debate over candidates and vision anytime soon. All four of the top candidates heading into the caucuses had campaign war chests large enough to sustain them through February, including the New Hampshire primary next week.
A self-described democratic socialist, Mr. Sanders has recently shown strength in national polls. That has triggered concerns among centrist Democrats who worry President Trump, a Republican, would use Mr. Sanders's political identity to damage the party's prospects in November.
The release of the results followed a brief news conference Tuesday afternoon with Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price, who said the nearly one-day delay for even partial results was unacceptable and happened because of ""multiple reporting challenges"" as about 1,700 precincts began to feed results into state party headquarters.
Mr. Price declined to say when all of the state's results would be made public. ""We're going to take the time we need,"" he said.
The state party is collecting paper records completed during the precinct meetings. It has attributed the holdup to a software glitch that triggered inconsistencies in data obtained from a mobile app used to report vote tallies.
""We know this data is accurate,"" Mr. Price said. ""We also have a paper trail.""
With 71% of precincts reporting, Mr. Buttigieg had the largest share of delegates to the state party convention, while Mr. Sanders had the second most. But Mr. Sanders led in the raw vote so far, followed by Mr. Buttigieg.
Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden were third and fourth respectively in both counts.
Mr. Buttigieg, a 38-year-old openly gay man who is the youngest in the race, could see a bump following what appears to be the best showing of any moderate in the race. He has positioned himself as a voice for generational change -- most of his top opponents are septuagenarians -- who is willing to work across the political aisle.
In New Hampshire, Mr. Buttigieg has also recorded strong support in polls, but he faces a stiffer challenge in the more ethnically diverse states of Nevada and South Carolina this month, as he has so far received virtually no support in polls from black and Latino voters.
The muddled reporting gave all the top candidates room to frame the result as a win.
Speaking to reporters Tuesday evening in New Hampshire after the release of some Iowa results, Mr. Buttigieg was asked what it would mean to his candidacy if he ends up finishing in second or third place. ""It still amounts to an astonishing victory for our vision,"" he said.
In a statement, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders called the early numbers gratifying. ""In the partial data released so far, it's clear that in the first and second round more people voted for Bernie than any other candidate in the field,"" Jeff Weaver said.
Ms. Warren said at her first New Hampshire event on Tuesday, ""We know that three of us will be dividing up most of the delegates coming out of Iowa. I'm feeling good.""
Mr. Biden during an appearance in Nashua, N.H., expressed optimism after arriving from Iowa. ""It's like my mother said, 'Hope springs eternal,'"" Mr. Biden said. ""We're not giving up.""
State party officials in Nevada, where the second caucus of the nominating season will be held, on Feb. 22, pledged that they wouldn't experience the same failures as Iowa.
""We will not be employing the same app or vendor used in the Iowa caucus,"" Nevada State Democratic Party Chair William McCurdy said in a statement. ""We had already developed a series of backups and redundant reporting systems, and are currently evaluating the best path forward.""
Meanwhile, Mr. Trump pounced on the uncertainty, calling the Democratic caucuses an ""unmitigated disaster"" in a Tuesday morning tweet, ahead of his State of the Union address scheduled for that evening.
The reporting was complicated in this year's caucuses by additional data.
In response to calls for greater transparency following the close 2016 contest between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton, the state party was to release for the first time the raw total for votes from both rounds of voting, along with the traditional share of delegates won.
Mr. Sanders has been ahead of his rivals in recent state polls in New Hampshire but Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg have been within striking distance.
New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley said it is ""highly unusual to have at this point so many competitive campaigns. Usually we are down to three at the most.""

DES MOINES, Iowa—An election debacle unfolded Monday night as the Iowa Democratic Party failed to release the results of the
state's presidential caucuses
, saying it had found ""inconsistencies in the reporting"" as the nation awaited the outcome of the first-in-the-nation nominating contest.
""In addition to the tech systems being used to tabulate results, we are also using photos of results and a paper trail to validate that all results match and ensure that we have confidence and accuracy in the numbers we report,"" Mandy McClure, the state party's communications director, said in a statement.
She said
a mobile app
used to record and report results from each caucus site ""did not go down and this is not a hack or an intrusion. The underlying data and paper trail is sound and will simply take time to further report the results.""
The delay has temporarily deprived the winner of the burst of media attention and momentum that typically comes from success in Iowa. It also may have given any candidates who performed poorly a free pass.
During an early Tuesday conference call with the campaigns, state party officials said they weren't willing to provide details on any results they had collected, according to a person familiar with the call. The officials said they expected to release results later Tuesday but didn't specify a time, the person said.
The campaign of former Vice President Joe Biden said in a letter to the state party that ""acute failures are occurring statewide"" in the party's reporting system. ""We believe that the campaigns deserve full explanations and relevant information regarding the methods of quality control you are employing, and an opportunity to respond, before any official results are released,"" wrote Dana Remus, general counsel for Mr. Biden's campaign.

Richard Harpootlian, a former South Carolina Democratic chairman who volunteered for Mr. Biden's campaign in a suburban Des Moines precinct, called the caucuses ""the most convoluted, distorting process I've ever been involved with.""
""We all entered stuff on an app. So where's the results? They're just dragging it out,"" Mr. Harpootlian said.
President Trump pounced on the uncertainty, calling the Democratic caucuses an ""unmitigated disaster"" in a
Tuesday morning tweet
. ""Nothing works, just like they ran the Country,"" he wrote, adding that only he can claim victory in the state. The president is
scheduled to deliver
his annual State of the Union address Tuesday night.
With the results still unknown, several campaigns released internal, unverifiable data from the caucuses to claim a favorable result. The candidates also took to stages scattered around Iowa's capital to declare their own versions of success.
""I imagine, have a strong feeling, that at some point, the results will be announced,"" said Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. ""And when those results are announced, I have a good feeling we're going to be doing very, very well here in Iowa.""
Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar told her supporters gathered at a caucus night party that they are ""punching above their weight.""
""Even in a crowded field of candidates, even during the well-earned impeachment hearing of Donald J. Trump, which had me bolted to my Senate desk for the last two weeks, we kept fighting,"" Ms. Klobuchar told her supporters. ""And you kept fighting for me.""

The caucuses kicked off the party's
quest to find a challenger to President Trump
in November's election, formally opening a primary campaign that showed no signs of wrapping up quickly.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called the race ""too close to call"" during her speech, but said she was confident the final Iowa results would show her in a strong position.
Ms. Warren once again signaled that her campaign is gearing up for a long nomination fight. ""This fight will stretch across all 57 states and territories that make up this great nation until we unite together as a party in Milwaukee,"" she said, referring to the host city of the party's convention this summer.
Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., took the stage and claimed victory, even as he acknowledged the official results were unknown.
""By all indications, we are going on to New Hampshire victorious,"" he told his supporters. ""We don't know all the results, but we do know when it's all said and done, Iowa, you have shocked the nation.""

The reporting was complicated in this year's caucuses by additional data. For the first time—in response to calls for greater transparency—the state party was to release the raw total for votes from both rounds of voting, along with the traditional share of delegates won.
The data had to be transmitted from nearly 1,700 neighborhood caucuses, typically held in school gymnasiums and public libraries. Dozens of additional ""satellite caucuses"" were held for those unable to attend a meeting in their own neighborhood.

Some precinct chairs struggled to transmit caucus results, according to people familiar with the situation, both via a mobile app and by a backup telephone system.
Two caucus organizers said before the gatherings started that they had heard about issues with downloading or logging into the app, meaning they would likely need to call in their results over a secure phone line that had been set up as a backup plan.
The state party said before the caucuses that the reported issues had come mainly from areas with poor cellphone service or have involved minor user errors.
After the caucuses began, Adin Mann, a caucus official in Story County, said in an interview that the app ""wasn't working at all.""
An Iowa campaign operative said the state party said on a conference call with the presidential campaigns that 35% of precincts were able to successfully report their results. But when campaign officials asked for additional details, including if the state party might provide a statement offering clarity, the call ended abruptly.
Democrats have been debating whether to back someone promising major change and a bigger governmental role in the economy, such as Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren, or a more moderate candidate who might win over independents and some Republicans. Messrs. Biden and Buttigieg fall into that camp.
There are indications the party is unlikely to resolve this debate soon. All four of the top candidates heading into the caucuses had campaign war chests large enough to sustain them through February, including New Hampshire's primary on Feb. 11.
Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, has recently shown strength in national polls. That has triggered concerns among centrist Democrats who worry Mr. Trump would use Mr. Sanders's political identity to damage the party's prospects in Midwestern battleground states that helped decide the 2016 election.
If Mr. Sanders shows strength in the first few state contests over more moderate candidates like Messrs. Biden and Buttigieg, it would almost certainly add fuel to the candidacy of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire, is skipping any serious competition for the first four states holding nominating contests, a strategy no successful candidate has pursued in the modern era. He is instead focusing his fortune on states with primaries and caucuses in March, a month when about 60% of the delegates to the national convention are in play. And he has already spent lavishly, devoting more than $300 million to the campaign.
His prospects in the Democratic nominating race likely rest on whether Mr. Biden is doing well or struggling to compete after the first several contests, as well as whether another moderate like Mr. Buttigieg or Ms. Klobuchar—who focused on competing in Iowa this year—has moved into contention by the end of February.
The massive size of the Democratic field—still at close to a dozen—has complicated the party's hopes of coalescing around a nominee more quickly than in 2016. Some supporters of Mrs. Clinton, the eventual nominee, have said she was harmed by an extended fight for the nomination with Mr. Sanders.
A victory in Iowa would offer a significant achievement to Mr. Sanders, who overcame a heart attack during the fall and has separated himself from Ms. Warren, the party's other leading liberal in the race, in recent months.

What Happens at the Iowa Caucuses

Mr. Biden, meanwhile, has campaigned on his experience, his ties to former President Obama and his contention that he would give the party its best chance of defeating Mr. Trump in a series of hard-fought battleground states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Mr. Biden's birth state of Pennsylvania.
Ms. Warren struggled during the fall to explain how she would implement—and pay for—a Medicare-for-all health plan and has watched her poll numbers dip as Mr. Sanders has improved his standing with liberals and Mr. Buttigieg has picked up support among suburban voters.
Mr. Buttigieg, a military veteran who is openly gay, entered the race as a relatively unknown mayor of a midsize city but has raised his profile through an extensive media campaign and focus on early voting states. To gain traction, however, he would need to gain interest among African-American voters in states such as South Carolina, where he has limited support.
The future of Ms. Klobuchar's candidacy could be more dependent on the Iowa outcome than the others because of her deep investment in the state and status as a neighbor.
When Democrats settle on their nominee, they will enter a general-election contest against a man who has been preparing for the fight since he took office more than three years ago. Mr. Trump is likely to be the best-funded president seeking re-election in history and will have a sophisticated digital messaging and get-out-the-vote operation at his disposal.

When the going gets tough, Bernie Sanders's aides talk about what happened on Oct. 4.
That was the day the Vermont senator left the hospital after a heart attack, just after the lowest point in his presidential bid, and a reminder that the campaign has proven it can turn things around.
This week, after chaotic results out of the Iowa Democratic Party and no clear answer about who won the state's presidential caucuses, aides acknowledged frustration. So the campaign sought to reset ahead of next week's New Hampshire primary, declaring victory in Iowa while results were still coming in and disclosing massive January fundraising.
Mr. Sanders had a lead in the popular vote with 97% of precincts reporting as of Thursday. But he and former South Bend Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg were locked in a tight race for the metric that Iowa Democrats consider most important, so-called state delegate equivalents. On Thursday, the chair of the Democratic Party called for a recanvass—the auditing of paper records from each precinct's caucus—after technical problems marred the tabulation of results.
""Where I come from and where everybody else comes from, the person who gets the most votes wins,"" Mr. Sanders said during a press conference in Manchester, N.H. ""We got the most votes.""
In interviews, Mr. Sanders's top aides said they plan to stick with their strategy of appealing to young people and minorities, saying the candidate did well in Iowa precincts with large populations of those groups. On Thursday,
the campaign announced it received $25 million from grass-roots donors in January
—more than many candidates raised in entire quarters last year—and said it is investing $5.5 million in advertising in 10 states set to vote in late February and early March.
Mr. Sanders has been leading in polls in New Hampshire, too.
""I am confident that here in New Hampshire, I know you'll be able to count your votes on election night,"" Mr. Sanders told a crowd in Milford, N.H., Tuesday night. ""And when you count those votes, I look forward to winning here in New Hampshire.""
The Iowa results carried some warning signs for Mr. Sanders.
The close race with Mr. Buttigieg
, a 38-year-old Washington outsider who has sought to appeal to moderates, reveals the Democratic Party remains ideologically divided and is still deciding what type of candidate should take on President Trump.
Some more centrist voters worry that Mr. Sanders—a self-described Democratic socialist—could scare off moderate Republicans and independent voters looking for an alternative to President Trump. And Mr. Sanders could face difficulty expanding his base if the field narrows. His strategy to rack up delegates relies on a fractured Democrats field. If candidates were to drop out, early voters could coalesce around one of his opponents.
The caucuses also saw lower-than-expected turnout, despite the Vermont senator's vow to expand the electorate.
Mr. Sanders narrowly lost the state in his long-shot bid for the Democratic nomination in 2016. This time, Mr. Sanders announced his run in February with strong name identification and a more experienced team.
To move ahead of a crowded field, the Sanders campaign invested in its ground game in Iowa. On Feb. 1, the campaign announced it had knocked on half a million doors since the beginning of January. As of Monday, the Sanders campaign had bought nearly $11 million worth of TV and radio advertisements in the state, trailing just businessman Tom Steyer, who spent over $16 million.
Jane O'Meara Sanders, Mr. Sanders's wife, also said campaigning in the final days before the caucuses felt different than it did four years ago.
""I felt that in 2016, we were introducing him at every venue, we were introducing Bernie Sanders to Iowa,"" Mrs. Sanders said in an interview the weekend before the Iowa caucuses.

While nine out of 10 people in Iowa are white, the Sanders campaign also
focused on increasing turnout from voters in minority communities
and sent organizers to talk with people in areas with large Latino populations, said Misty Rebik, his Iowa state director. Mr. Sanders also held an event on a Native American settlement in Iowa and focused on how his policies would affect those in attendance. Mr. Sanders and the rest of the field have struggled for the support of African-American voters, particularly older ones, who have flocked to former Vice President Joe Biden.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez met with Latinos on her trips to the state. Her decision to endorse the Vermont senator while he was still in the hospital last fall helped give a shot of energy to a lagging campaign, as did those of two other liberal congresswomen, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.).
All three were in Iowa for Mr. Sanders in the last two weeks, campaigning across the state as he was stuck in Washington for the impeachment trial of President Trump.
Aides believe Mr. Sanders was able to consolidate support in the final weeks after voters looked at other candidates and compared them to Mr. Sanders, who has been calling for the same policies for decades.
Heather Purdy, a 45-year-old professor from Des Moines, said she had decided on Mr. Sanders the week before the caucuses. Ms. Purdy had been considering Mr. Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, but she said the Vermont lawmaker's consistency ultimately won her over.
""He's had the same platform for the last 40 years,"" she said.

BURLINGTON, Vt.—Bernie Sanders's hopes of securing the Democratic presidential nomination rely on an unlikely path that would require him to top or tie Joe Biden in states he lost in his 2016 bid, a tough proposition as his momentum in the race wanes.
Mr. Sanders indicated Wednesday that he plans to stay in the race and participate in Sunday's Democratic debate in Phoenix,
despite losing four of the six states that held nominating contests Tuesday
.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How do you think Bernie Sanders will perform in the Florida primary? Join the conversation below.
""I very much look forward to the debate in Arizona with my friend Joe Biden,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""Donald Trump must be defeated.…On Sunday night, in the first one-on-one debate of this campaign, the American people will have the opportunity to see which candidate is best positioned to accomplish that goal.""
But his path to the nomination has grown so difficult that big-money Democratic groups that remained neutral for much of the race have now declared Mr. Biden, the former vice president, the likely nominee. In a speech Tuesday night in Philadelphia, Mr. Biden was already looking ahead to a general election against Mr. Trump, thanking Mr. Sanders and his supporters ""for their tireless energy and their passion.""
Mr. Sanders's loss in Michigan—the biggest delegate prize of the night and a state he won in the 2016 primaries—was a particularly hard-hitting blow because Mr. Sanders has argued that he is the best candidate to beat Mr. Trump in Midwestern states.
The Vermont senator and his campaign are hoping that a strong performance during Sunday's debate, which will take place without a live audience because of coronavirus concerns, will help save his floundering campaign.
""The dynamic of a one-on-one debate is much different than the dynamic of a one-on-10,"" spokesman Mike Casca said. ""We feel that the senator will have enough room in a two-hour debate with one other candidate to really strongly lay out the case for why his agenda is one that can be done.""
But even with a stellar debate performance, aides to Mr. Sanders acknowledge his chances of being the Democratic nominee are slim following Tuesday night's walloping. Next Tuesday, they are hoping for a victory in Arizona, where
roughly one-third of the population is Hispanic
, a demographic with which the Vermont senator has expanded his support this cycle. But Mr. Sanders lost the state by 18 points in 2016 and
recent polling has shown Mr. Biden ahead
.
Aides are also hoping for strong performances, if not outright wins, in Ohio and Illinois. Mr. Sanders lost Ohio by 14 points and Illinois by 2 points in 2016. One poll released this year in Illinois had
Mr. Sanders ahead
of a still-fractured field.
Ohio
hasn't had Democratic primary polling this year.
The result in Michigan appears to bode ill for Mr. Sanders in those nearby states. In the days leading up to the vote in Michigan, Mr. Sanders
all but camped out in the state and moved key aides in
. He increased his criticism of Mr. Biden for supporting trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Biden, however, won by 16.5 points.
Mr. Sanders's aides acknowledge that Florida, which offers the most pledged delegates of the states voting next week and which he lost by 32 points four years ago,
will be difficult
. The self-described Democratic socialist has praised parts of Fidel Castro's legacy, while condemning the oppressive actions of the Cuban dictator,
which hasn't gone over well
with Florida's large Cuban population.
Mr. Sanders's aides, however, point out that California, the largest prize in the entire nominating contest, went for him on March 3 and results are still being tallied, meaning the senator will likely gain more delegates from that primary. Colorado, another state Mr. Sanders won, is also still tabulating results.
Mr. Sanders has said he would support Mr. Biden if the former vice president is the Democratic nominee.
In his remarks Wednesday, Mr. Sanders said while his progressive ideas were popular, he was losing voters who were worried about beating President Trump.
'While our campaign has won the ideological debate, we are losing the debate over electability,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""I cannot tell you how many people our campaign has spoken to who have said, and I quote, 'I like what your campaign stands for, I agree with what your campaign stands for, but I'm gonna vote for Joe Biden because I think Joe is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump.'""
""We have heard that statement all over this country,"" he said.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said this week that he plans to use the 11th Democratic debate to press front-runner Joe Biden on a series of liberal policy issues.
Mr. Sanders acknowledged Wednesday, after a set of losses in
key primaries the night before
that he was losing what he called the ""debate over electability"" to Mr. Biden. But he said if the former vice president hopes to win over his liberal supporters, he needs to sell them on his plans for health care, student loan debt and more.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How do you expect Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders to set themselves apart from one another in this debate? Join the conversation below.
Here are five of the questions Mr. Sanders said he planned to ask and a comparison of what the two Democrats have said on each issue in past debates.
Health care and Medicare for All: ""What are you going to do to end the absurdity of the United States of America being the only major country on earth where health care is not a human right? Are you really going to veto a Medicare for All bill, if it is passed in Congress?""
Biden in Feb. 7 debate: ""My proposal gives you a choice. You're gonna be covered. You have Medicare if you want it, you turn up, we're gonna restore all the cuts that they made in Obamacare. We're gonna reduce drug prices, reduce prescription prices, reduce copays, etc. And it costs a lot of money, it costs $750 billion over 10 years…Bernie's plan costs double, double what the taxpayers are paying for every single program we spend on in the United States of America.""
Sanders in Dec. 19 debate: ""When the American people understand that Medicare for All expands Medicare to cover home health care, dental care, eyeglasses in hearing aids and does it add a cost far, far lower than what some of my opponents are talking about, you know what? We are going to have the American people behind us. We will have Congress behind us.""
Medical costs and debt: ""What are you going to do for the 500,000 people who go bankrupt in our country because of medically related debt? And what are you going to do for the working people of this country and small-business people who are paying on average 20 percent to health care?""
Biden in Jan. 14 debate: ""The proposal I lay out does in fact limit drug costs. It sets up—allows all of the drug companies to—excuse me, it allows you to—Medicare to negotiate with drug companies for the price. It sets a system whereby you cannot raise the price of a drug beyond the cost of medical inflation and, by the way, there is mental health parity that I called for in the Obamacare expanded with the Biden option.""
Sanders in Jan. 14 debate: ""We are spending twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country. Look, we have talked about health care for all in this country for over 100 years. Now is the time to take on the greed and corruption of the health-care industry, of the drug companies and finally provide health care to all through a Medicare for All single-payer program. It won't be easy, but that is what we have to do.""
Income inequality: ""What are you going to do to end the absurdity of billionaires buying elections and the three wealthiest people in America owning more wealth than the bottom half of our people?""
Biden in June 27 debate: ""Look, Donald Trump has put us in a horrible situation. We do have enormous income inequality, and one thing I agree honestly can make massive cuts in the $1.6 trillion in tax loopholes out there, and I would be going about eliminating Donald Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy.""
Sanders in Feb. 19 debate: ""We have a wealth tax...We are going to raise it in a progressive way which deals with income and wealth inequality and makes certain, finally, that health care in this country is a human right, not a privilege.""
College Affordability and Student Debt: ""What are you going to do to make sure that all of our people can go to college or trade school regardless of their income? And what are you going to do about the millions of people who are struggling with outrageous levels of student debt?""
Biden in June 27 debate: ""That's why there should be free community college, cutting in half the cost of college. That's why we should be in the position where we do not have anyone have to pay back the student debt when they get out, they're making less than $25,000 a year. Their debt is frozen. No interest payment until they get beyond that. We can't put people in a position where they aren't able to go on and move on.""
Sanders in Dec. 19 debate: ""We need to make public colleges and universities tuition-free, and by taxing billionaires and by taxing Wall Street, we will cancel all student debt in this country.""
Climate change and energy: ""How are you going to respond to the scientists who tell us we have seven or eight years remaining to transform our energy system before irreparable harm takes place to this planet because of the ravages of climate change?""
Biden in Jan. 14 debate: ""Look, what we have to do is we have to act right away. And the way we act right away is immediately, if I'm elected president, I will reinstate all the mileage standards that existed in our administration, which were taken down. That's 12 billion gallons of gasoline, barrels of gasoline to be saved immediately.""
Sanders in Feb. 19 debate: ""This is an existential threat. You know what that means, Chuck? That means we are fighting for the future of this planet. And the Green New Deal that I support, by the way, will create up to 20 million good paying jobs as we move our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.""
Mass incarceration: ""At a time when we have more people in jail than communist China, a nation four times our size, what are you going to do to end mass incarceration and a racist criminal justice system?""
Biden in Sept. 12 debate: ""We should be talking about rehabilitation. Nobody should be in jail for a nonviolent crime. When we were in the White House, we released 36,000 people from the federal prison system. Nobody should be in jail for a drug problem. They should be going directly to a rehabilitation. We build more rehabilitation centers, not prisons. We—I'm the guy that put in the drug courts to divert people from the criminal justice system. And so, we have to change the whole way we look at this. When we put people in prison, we have to equip them when they get out.""
Sanders in Feb. 7 debate: ""We invest in our young people, in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration. We end the war on drugs, which has disproportionately impacted African-Americans, Latinos and Native Americans. We end private prisons and detention centers in America.""

Democratic presidential primary voters now overwhelmingly back Joe Biden over Bernie Sanders, a dramatic reversal in their standings of just one month ago, the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows.
Among those who have already voted or plan to do so, 61% support the former vice president, while 32% would prefer the Vermont senator as their party's nominee.
The standings are a major change from mid-February, when the survey showed Mr. Sanders backed by 27% of Democratic primary voters and Mr. Biden favored by just 15%.
At the time, Mr. Sanders stood alone as the party's front-runner, while Mr. Biden was among four candidates essentially tied for second place. But Mr. Biden's fortunes changed significantly following his win in
South Carolina's Feb. 29 primary
and dominance in a
string of field-narrowing primaries
since then.
The share of Democratic primary voters who say they have definitely settled on a candidate has skyrocketed in the past month, from 37% to 80%, giving Mr. Sanders little room for growth beyond his current base.
Moreover,
the coronavirus pandemic
, which has altered
many aspects of the campaign
, is making it harder for Mr. Sanders to break through with his message. It has also eliminated the large rallies that provide much of the fuel for his campaign.
""Bernie Sanders is on a cement trampoline—not a lot of bounce,"" said Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who worked on the survey with Jeff Horwitt, also a Democrat, and Republican Bill McInturff.
""The race is sort of locked into place,"" said Mr. McInturff. ""This is very clear, definitive data about the status of this race and the things Bernie Sanders was unable to do to create a coalition.""
A
televised debate
set for Sunday night between the two Democratic candidates will compete for attention with news of the pandemic, which is producing dramatic headlines almost by the hour. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii), who drew 4% support in the poll, didn't meet Democratic National Committee criteria to qualify for the debate.
The race doesn't look more different among the half of Democrats who have yet to vote than among those who already have cast ballots. Mr. Biden leads by 63% to 30% among primary voters in states that have already held primaries or caucuses and by 60% to 34% in the states that haven't voted.
""There is no indication that this gets easier for Bernie Sanders in the remaining half of the vote,'' Mr. McInturff said.
The level of enthusiasm among Democratic primary voters for Mr. Biden has also grown in the past month. Some 74% feel enthusiastic about or comfortable with him, up from 56% in February. The share enthusiastic about or comfortable with Mr. Sanders has been stable, at about 66%.
Groups that have swung most dramatically behind Mr. Biden in the last month include African-Americans, among whom he leads by 77% to 18%, as well as liberals and voters who say they are ""strongly'' aligned with the Democratic Party. Mr. Biden leads by nearly three-to-one among that group.
Looking to the general election, Mr. Biden led President Trump in the new survey by 9 percentage points, 52% to 43%, in a test match-up, while Mr. Sanders led by 4 points, 49% to 45%. Both margins were essentially unchanged from February.
The Journal/NBC News poll surveyed 900 registered voters, including 438 who said they would vote in a Democratic caucus or primary. The poll, conducted March 11-13, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points for the full sample and 4.7 percentage points for questions involving only people who would vote in a Democratic caucus and primary.

WASHINGTON -- President Trump's advisers are pondering the prospect of facing off against another antiestablishment candidate armed with giant rallies, loyal supporters and bold promises.
As Bernie Sanders gains strength in the Democratic presidential primary, Mr. Trump's aides and allies largely welcome a general election matchup with the self-avowed socialist. Still, some also acknowledge that the Vermont senator, who narrowly won the New Hampshire Democratic primary this week and leads in national polls of the Democratic nomination contest, would enter the race with momentum and some key similarities to Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump said as much Tuesday in the Oval Office, by way of criticizing former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. ""Frankly, I'd rather run against Bloomberg than Bernie Sanders, because Sanders has real followers -- whether you like him or not, whether you agree with him or not,"" Mr. Trump said.
Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders have attracted passionate supporters, who flock to their rock-concert like rallies. That similarity was on display on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, when Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders held dueling rallies in the state. The president drew more than 11,000 supporters in Manchester and the senator more than 7,500 in Durham.
To the president, a political outsider who sees his massive rallies and loyal base as key to his electoral strength, Mr. Sanders's crowds are noteworthy. Like Mr. Trump, the senator is also a nontraditional figure who argues he can expand the electorate by energizing new voters with his message.
Rep. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.), who is Mr. Sanders's national campaign co-chairman, stressed the senator's support on Fox News Wednesday.
""So he is building the type of coalition that can really defeat Donald Trump. And Trump actually understands it,"" Mr. Khanna said. ""I mean, Trump understands the power of crowds, he understands the power of having an online following. And he is right to recognize that Bernie Sanders is the person on the other side who's building that.""
After the New Hampshire results came in, Mr. Sanders told supporters that ""this victory here is the beginning of the end for Donald Trump.""
He later added: ""Our campaign is not just about beating Trump, it is about transforming this country.""
Polling shows Mr. Sanders, whose campaign didn't respond to a request for comment, performing similarly to others in the Democratic race in hypothetical matchups with Mr. Trump. A recent WSJ/NBC poll showed Mr. Sanders leading Mr. Trump 49% to 46%.
For months, the Trump campaign has openly relished the prospect of running against Mr. Sanders, seeking to elevate him with commentary suggesting he was being disenfranchised by the Democratic Party.
People with knowledge of campaign and White House thinking said Mr. Sanders was viewed as the Democratic candidate who generated significant voter enthusiasm, with his highly motivated base of support. While they consider him beatable and many said they welcome the contrast, some also characterized him as a candidate who could appeal as Mr. Trump did in 2016.
But Trump's allies also argue that Mr. Sanders's policies may lean too far left for much of the electorate, particularly suburban voters.
""He's always been my first choice"" to run against, said former 2016 Trump campaign aide Barry Bennett. ""I just think he is the starkest contrast. . . . I just don't think that a candidate that far left has much appeal outside of California and New York.""
Democratic strategist Jim Manley said Mr. Sanders provided a lot of opportunities for Republicans to attack.
""I get the idea that Team Trump is going to go low no matter who we put up, but I for one think Sen. Sanders is going to be a really target-rich environment for a lot of Trump folks, starting with the president,"" he said. But he added: ""They need to take him seriously because just like Trump, he's got a movement around him, and he's very good at painting his opponents as the enemy.""
Just how this face-off could affect the electoral map remains uncertain. Mr. Sanders is viewed as a strong contender in some key battleground states, including Michigan and Wisconsin, which Mr. Trump captured in 2016 with a similar message on trade.

NASHUA, N.H.—Democrats in search of a centrist nominee to challenge President Trump are increasingly worried after contests in
Iowa
and
New Hampshire
consolidated liberal support behind Bernie Sanders and divided the larger moderate vote among multiple candidates.
The party's center lane is crowded with the rising former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Vice President Joe Biden. Looming in the
March 3 Super Tuesday states
and beyond is former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, buoyed by
campaign spending that dwarfs all his opponents combined
.
With no clear centrist front-runner, vulnerable freshman Democrats in Congress are texting each other anxiously, a Biden-allied fundraiser warns of a ""doomsday scenario"" and party strategists fret about what mixed early-state turnout means for November.
Predictions about which candidates are the most electable and which will prevail through a long primary season have proven unreliable in the past, particularly at this early stage of the process, before voting in the diverse states of South Carolina and Nevada. Barack Obama faced intraparty doubts in 2008, as did Mr. Trump in 2016.
With multiple contenders vowing to stay in the race, party leaders are yet again bracing for the likelihood of a protracted fight for the nomination that may not be settled by the time of the July convention in Milwaukee.
Adding to some Democrats' worries is the president's
acquittal from impeachment
and his strength among his most fervent supporters, as evidenced by the more than 11,000 who turned out for his
Monday night rally in Manchester, N.H.
, a larger crowd than any assembled by a Democrat campaigning in the state.
""There is one thing that's universal, and that is anxiety,"" said Rufus Gifford, who served as finance director for President Obama's re-election campaign and has contributed to several campaigns.

The fear among some Democrats is predicated on the idea that Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator and self-described democratic socialist, would struggle to defeat Mr. Trump in November. Mr. Sanders and his supporters believe the party could unite around him if he is the nominee and that he could energize young voters and those in crucial Rust Belt states who swung to the GOP in 2016.
The Sanders campaign disputed the notion he would hurt Democrats in swing districts, noting that candidates in states that will be crucial in 2020 had requested his help during 2018 midterms.
Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg, a 38-year-old newcomer to the national scene, essentially tied in Iowa and finished one-two in New Hampshire. Ms. Warren has faded in the first two contests but is pressing forward, while Ms. Klobuchar, the No. 3 finisher in Iowa, is eyeing delegates when her home state of Minnesota votes on March 3.
If Mr. Biden has a strong showing in South Carolina and Nevada, he could regain lost momentum and potentially persuade wavering Democrats to stick with him through subsequent states.
Mr. Bloomberg meanwhile has poured more than $350 million of his fortune into a series of March states, including California, Texas and North Carolina.
Philip Levine, a former mayor of Miami Beach, Fla., who supports Mr. Bloomberg, said in an interview he received ""an avalanche"" of phone calls and emails Wednesday from donors asking how they could help, and from elected officials, whom he didn't name, asking his advice on ""how to tactfully retract"" their endorsements of Mr. Biden and shift their support to Mr. Bloomberg.
Some Democratic donors say privately there will be a lot of pressure for Mr. Biden to get out after South Carolina if he performs poorly there.
""We are going to compete in Super Tuesday states,"" said Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a Biden campaign co-chairman. ""Bloomberg is spending an awful lot of money, but he's also not had his turn in the barrel. He has not been on the debate stage. He's untested.""
Larry Rasky, who leads a pro-Biden super PAC called Unite the Country, sought to rally Biden donors in a fundraising memo Sunday by telling them that if they hedge their bets on Mr. Biden because of Mr. Bloomberg, they could be creating a ""doomsday scenario.""
""The Sanders-Warren wing of the Party is ready for the Bloomberg fight. Democrats cannot afford a split Convention. Do you really think the Sanders voters wing will support Mike Bloomberg? Do you think all the camps who have busted their butts and played by the rules will happily sign on"" to Mr. Bloomberg's campaign, he wrote.
The party's attempt to present itself as a steady, competent alternative to Mr. Trump has been
marred by the chaotic Iowa caucuses
, where more than a week later Mr. Sanders narrowly trails Mr. Buttigieg in state delegates, but Mr. Sanders leads in the popular vote. Both candidates have requested a recanvassing of certain precincts.
Party strategists are watching early-state turnout closely for clues about whether Democrats are energized to vote.

More than 176,000 people participated in the Iowa Democratic caucuses this year, a slight increase from four years ago but well behind the nearly 240,000 who caucused in 2008. New Hampshire was a brighter spot for Democrats: Turnout reached about 297,000 voters in the Democratic primary, compared with about 255,000 in 2016 and nearly 290,000 in 2008.
""Everything is splintered,"" said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist and former adviser to West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. ""And it just shows that voters aren't falling in love with any of these candidates, and that's a problem.""
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who has conducted focus groups in early-voting states and general-election battlegrounds, said she has been struck by ""the duality of who you like and who you think can beat Trump. And they're not necessarily the same thing.""

In a sign of Democrats' interest in finding an alternative to Mr. Biden, some moderate House Democrats have embraced Mr. Bloomberg, including Reps. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Haley Stevens of Michigan and Scott Peters of California. On Wednesday, two African-American members of Congress, Reps. Lucy McBath (D., Ga.) and Gregory Meeks (D., N.Y.) said they were backing Mr. Bloomberg. All are members of the centrist New Democrat Coalition.
Rep. Stephanie Murphy, the chairwoman of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition caucus, said Mr. Sanders wouldn't be able to win over swing voters, and if he becomes the party's nominee, he could put the new House majority at risk. ""For many moderate districts and Trump-won districts, Bernie Sanders at the top of the ticket would create headwinds for house members running for re-election,"" she said.

Former Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, who supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, said in a tweet Tuesday that ""Sanders is just as polarizing as Trump AND he'll ruin our economy."" Mr. Sanders's campaign manager tweeted back: ""This is what panic from the Wall Street elite looks and sounds like.""
For most of the campaign, Mr. Biden has presented himself as the candidate best able to win states narrowly carried by Mr. Trump, including his boyhood state of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.
""He did not have a shot to win Iowa or do well in Iowa,"" said Rep. Tim Ryan (D., Ohio), who endorsed Mr. Biden after his own candidacy failed. ""His two strongest groups are communities of color and older voters, and both are pretty much excluded from the caucus process.""
Mr. Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, joined a conference call with the campaign's top financial donors on Wednesday afternoon, according to three participants, and noted the campaign's strength in Nevada and South Carolina among Latinos and African-Americans.
Polls indicate that Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar both have struggled to appeal to African-American voters. Mr. Bloomberg apologized for a second time Tuesday amid a fresh round of criticism for his support of stop-and-frisk policing in New York City.
Mr. Sanders has argued that Democrats must nominate someone who can generate enthusiasm and mobilize young people and infrequent voters who were turned off by their choices in the 2016 election. The senator has arguably the best ability to command large crowds, evidenced by more than 7,500 people who showed up for a primary eve rally and concert at the University of New Hampshire.
In the last week, Mr. Sanders has taken the lead in the RealClearPolitics average of national Democratic primary polls, after Mr. Biden had led for months.
While Mr. Biden's candidacy has foundered, Mr. Bloomberg has courted members of Congress. In January, Mr. Bloomberg flew to Salt Lake City where Rep. Ben McAdams (D., Utah) hosted the former mayor at his home with local Democrats and Republicans. Mr. Bloomberg talked about his hope for a pragmatic government and answered questions on climate change and fiscal responsibility.
Mr. McAdams said he was looking for someone he could support, but also said he was looking for someone who understood a congressional district like his own, which the president carried by 7 percentage points in 2016.
About a week later, he endorsed Mr. Bloomberg.

HOUSTON—Bernie Sanders's resounding victory in
the weekend's Nevada caucuses
cast him as the clear front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination and enhanced the Vermont senator's argument that he can build a diverse coalition of voters ahead of potentially decisive contests.
At the same time, the senator's latest win, and his momentum ahead of next Saturday's South Carolina primary and the
Super Tuesday contests March 3
, are stirring increasing anxiety among some establishment Democrats who believe a more centrist nominee would have a better chance to beat President Trump in November and help carry down-ballot candidates across the finish line. If Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, performs well on March 3, when more than one-third of the total convention delegates are up for grabs, it could be difficult for any Democratic rivals to overtake him.
Mr. Sanders has said he can expand the electorate by bringing in new voters, which would help him overcome any concerns about ideology in a general election. Nevada, a more diverse state than mostly white Iowa and New Hampshire, gave Mr. Sanders the first opportunity to show he can expand the electorate and build the ""multigeneration, multiracial coalition"" he has said will propel him. This year's Nevada caucuses are on track to break turnout records.
""We have won the popular vote in Iowa, we won the New Hampshire primary, we won the Nevada caucus,"" Mr. Sanders told supporters in Houston on Sunday, at a rally ahead of the March 3 Texas primary. ""Don't tell anybody this, these folks get very, very agitated and nervous, we're gonna win here in Texas, and in November, we're going to defeat Trump here in Texas.""
Mr. Sanders's strong position shows the appeal of running as antiestablishment on both sides of the aisle; Mr. Trump, after all, ran as a GOP outsider in 2016. The Vermont senator's position would have been unimaginable five years ago, when the independent, who has never changed his party affiliation to Democrat in the Senate, launched his first long-shot bid for the presidency.
But with his policy positions long seen as far to the left of many Democrats, many party veterans are haunted by the memory of liberal Sen. George McGovern's 49-state loss to GOP President Richard Nixon in 1972. A nomination of Mr. Sanders would mark a decisive break with the more center-left path forged by Bill Clinton in 1992 and Barack Obama in 2008.

Mr. Sanders leads Mr. Trump
in a poll of a general-election matchup, although his margin is thinner than those of some other top contenders.
With about 88% of Nevada precincts reporting Sunday evening, former Vice President Joe Biden—a more moderate candidate who was the national polling leader for most of 2019—was in second place, followed by Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Billionaire activist Tom Steyer looked set to place fifth while Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar followed closely behind in sixth.
Mr. Biden attended church services on Sunday in a predominantly black neighborhood of North Charleston, S.C. In an acknowledgment of Mr. Sanders's strength in the three prior contests, Mr. Biden told reporters: ""Whoever wins this primary is going into Super Tuesday very strongly, and I think it's going to be Bernie and me going into Super Tuesday.""

According to entrance polls in Nevada
, Mr. Sanders won nearly every demographic segment—including voters ages 17 to 64, white voters, Latino voters and first time caucus-goers. The only segments he lost to Mr. Biden were black voters, voters over age 65 and voters opposed to a single-payer health-care system. Mr. Sanders supports a program known as Medicare for All.
Mr. Sanders's coalition will be put to the test in the next round of states. In his unsuccessful 2016 primary bid against Hillary Clinton, he struggled to bring in support from minorities.
While Mr. Sanders trails Mr. Biden in South Carolina, a
Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Friday
showed the two men running even among black Democratic primary voters nationally, a crucial part of Mr. Biden's constituency in South Carolina and other Southern states.
Mr. Biden mingled with churchgoers who generally represent his base of support in the primary. Ken Morris, a 68-year-old retired member of the Marine Corps, said he believed Mr. Sanders couldn't win the general election.
""There's not too many people who believe in socialism,"" Mr. Morris said. ""Joe is more centrist. More people trust him. You can't beat a guy who is all the way to the right by going all the way to the left.""
Voters, particularly those who are younger, say Mr. Sanders's ""consistency"" on the issues of health care, climate change and education is why they back him over the rest of the crowded field. Some older voters who were originally skeptical of Mr. Sanders say they see he has the momentum—backed by a swell of enthusiastic young supporters—to win this cycle.
Steve McCormack, a 49-year-old business owner from the Houston suburb of The Woodlands, attended Mr. Sanders's Houston rally on Sunday. Mr. McCormack voted for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio in the 2016 GOP primary and sat out the general election.
But this cycle, Mr. McCormack said is going to vote ""blue no matter who,"" and he believes Mr. Sanders may be the nominee.
""I see it might be going this way"" toward Mr. Sanders winning the primary, he said.
Mr. Sanders is benefiting from a fractured field in which voters are splintered among his more moderate opponents. Mr. Trump enjoyed a similar situation on his way to claiming the Republican nomination in 2016, when much of the GOP establishment argued Mr. Trump would turn off too many voters to win the general election.
Super Tuesday states have had less consistent polling than some of the earlier ones, but Mr. Sanders has led recent polls in delegate-rich California and Texas. He has projected confidence about both states and has said a win in California means he would likely be on his way to the nomination.
On Sunday, author and former Democratic candidate
Marianne Williamson endorsed Mr. Sanders
for president, saying after his victory in Nevada ""the energy is unquestionably with Bernie.""
But some Democrats and groups looking to boost centrists aren't ready to concede the nomination.
""The race is not over, said Jonathan Kott, executive director of the Big Tent Project, which is running ads opposing Mr. Sanders in South Carolina. ""You have a lot of people still in the race, you have a lot of people that could win in different states.""
When asked if nominating Mr. Sanders could put Democrats' House majority in danger, Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, a top member of House Democratic leadership, said on ABC's ""This Week"" that ""a lot of people think so.""
The president's campaign has already signaled it would
tag Democrats as socialists in the general election
, particularly in states like Florida in an attempt to sway Venezuelan- and Cuban-Americans. Mr. Sanders has said his version of democratic socialism is a belief in basic rights for everyone, adding that his policies would be similar to those of former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
After South Carolina, the Democratic field will face former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the approximately $160 million he has spent on television and radio ads across Super Tuesday states, according to data from political-ad tracker Kantar/CMAG. That sum dwarfs that of the next biggest spender, Mr. Steyer. Because Mr. Bloomberg didn't compete in the first four states, Super Tuesday will be the first time candidates face the barrage of ads which could complicate the path for any candidate still in the race.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is weighing the future of his campaign after a third consecutive string of losses to former Vice President Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential race.
One day after Mr. Biden
swept all three Tuesday primaries
, held in Florida, Illinois and Arizona, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement that the Vermont senator ""is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign.""
Mr. Shakir signaled a decision was pending and said Mr. Sanders was focused on
the coronavirus pandemic
, pointing out that the next primary contest isn't scheduled for weeks. Georgia, which had been scheduled to hold its primary next week, delayed it until May because of the virus.
Mr. Sanders, who was in Washington on Wednesday for Senate votes on
coronavirus-response legislation
, grew frustrated when asked by reporters about his time frame for making a decision.
""I'm dealing with a f—ing global crisis. And you're asking me these questions,"" Mr. Sanders said, according to CNN. ""Right now, I'm trying to do my best to make sure that we don't have an economic meltdown and that people don't die.""
Mr. Sanders planned to return to his home in Vermont after the votes to ""assess the path forward"" with his wife, Jane Sanders, according to an email Mr. Shakir sent to supporters earlier in the day.
Meanwhile, Mr. Sanders's campaign had deactivated its digital ads on Facebook as of Wednesday morning, including ones that began running just a day earlier, according to the social network's ad transparency report. The Sanders campaign also hasn't reserved any television time past this week, according to political ad tracker Kantar/CMAG.
Mike Casca, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said Wednesday that the campaign deactivated all digital ads because it was ""conserving resources."" The campaign said it didn't book new TV ads for the same reason.
Mr. Sanders didn't address supporters on Tuesday as the results
widened Mr. Biden's delegate lead
and further cemented the former vice president's likely path to the nomination.
In Florida, a key general-election battleground, Mr. Biden carried all 67 counties. He also led Mr. Sanders by double digits in Illinois and Arizona.
Mr. Biden has won 1,153 pledged delegates so far, according to a Wall Street Journal delegate tracker, compared with Mr. Sanders at 861. Candidates need 1,991 delegates to secure the nomination at the Democratic convention this summer.
Mr. Biden's campaign said Mr. Sanders would need to win every remaining contest by roughly 40 points to close the delegate deficit.
""This primary is nowhere near as close as the 2008 and 2016 Democratic primaries,"" Mr. Biden's deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, wrote in a memo on Wednesday.
Mr. Biden made a direct appeal
to supporters of Mr. Sanders
in remarks Tuesday night from his hometown of Wilmington, Del., saying they agreed on broader priorities around health care, climate change and college affordability.
""Let me say to the young voters inspired by Sen. Sanders, I hear you. I know what's at stake,"" Mr. Biden said. ""Sen. Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision.""
Some of Mr. Biden's allies suggested that Mr. Sanders should help unite the party against President Trump.
""For the party to start focusing on Trump, we need ultimate cooperation from Bernie Sanders and his supporters,"" said South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn,
whose endorsement
ahead of his state's February primary helped propel Mr. Biden to victory. ""Whatever the presumptive nominee says…all of the opponents, previous opponents, should be supportive of it.""
Mr. Clyburn also called on the Democratic National Committee to curtail the primary debates, voicing concern that a viral, negative moment in a future debate could wound Mr. Biden's chances in the general election.
""There's nothing to be gained from these debates,"" he said.
Other Democrats called for Mr. Sanders to reconsider his campaign after Tuesday night's results showed his path to the nomination growing increasingly improbable.
""I think the conversation is going to quickly turn to how and when does Bernie Sanders unite the Democratic Party,"" former Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill said on MSNBC late Tuesday. ""Bernie's going to have plenty of delegates and power to influence the platform because we all want to come together.""
Tuesday's primaries marked the first slate of contests set against the backdrop of growing concerns around the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S.
The coronavirus outbreak has forced Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders to suspend large-scale campaign rallies and rely almost entirely on digital events. In a virtual rally with supporters on Monday, Mr. Sanders acknowledged he was ""losing the electability argument"" to Mr. Biden.
Several states—including Ohio, which was supposed to vote Tuesday—have postponed their primaries in the wake of the pandemic. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez has urged states to instead implement other ways to cast ballots rather than in person, such as voting by mail.
""States that have not yet held primary elections should focus on implementing the aforementioned measures to make it easier and safer for voters to exercise their constitutional right to vote, instead of moving primaries to later in the cycle when timing around the virus remains unpredictable,"" he said in a statement.

Results from the Iowa Democratic Party showed more than 176,000 people participated this year. PHOTO: Christopher Lee for The Wall Street Journal
Democratic turnout for this week's Iowa caucuses fell well below expectations, leading some in the party to wonder if the state has become more conservative—or if voters aren't as enthusiastic about defeating President Trump as they hoped.
Turnout in the Democratic caucuses appeared far short of the record of nearly 240,000 people in 2008, when Barack Obama defeated Hillary Clinton in his first step toward the White House.
With 100% of precincts reporting, results from the Iowa Democratic Party showed more than 176,000 people participated this year, slightly more than showed up in 2016. After record turnout nationally boosted Democrats in the 2018 midterms, the disappointing outing has some in the party worried about whether voters are as passionate about beating Republicans as they were more than a year ago.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do you think the Iowa caucus turnout is an appropriate bellwether this year? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
Democratic party officials had set expectations high ahead of the caucuses with state party Chairman Troy Price forecasting a record turnout in comments to the Des Moines Register last month.
""Perhaps the most alarming thing that came out of Iowa this week was not the incompetence of the party and the failed technology,"" former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who ended his own presidential bid in November, said in an email to supporters Friday. ""What should most concern us is that turnout might have barely kept pace with 2016 levels, and fell well below the historic turnout of 2008. We're in the middle of a national emergency, and people are staying home.""
The issue arose early during Friday night's Democratic debate in New Hampshire.
""That's a disappointment, and I think all of us probably could have done a better job in bringing out our supporters,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders said of Iowa's low turnout. ""But if there is a good spot, a good aspect ... it's that young people came out in higher numbers than they did during Obama's historic 2008 campaign.""
Political analysts who study the caucuses say turnout could have suffered because many voters remain undecided about who to back in the still-crowded field, causing them to sit out the contest. In The Wall Street Journal's conversations with dozens of voters in the final weeks before the caucuses, many said they would vote for any candidate in a general election against President Trump.
In addition, people who caucused with Democrats in 2008 might not consider themselves members of the party anymore. Mr. Obama won the state in two general elections, but President Trump won it in 2016 by 10 points. In 2018, a banner year for Democrats across the country, the party picked up two House seats in Iowa, but the Republican governor won another term.
""Democrats are simply not nearly as robust in rural Iowa as they used to be, which explains some of the decline,"" said David Wasserman, the House editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.

In
Howard County in northeast Iowa
, the only one of America's more than 3,000 counties that voted by more than 20 percentage points for Mr. Obama in 2012 and by more than 20 percentage points for Mr. Trump in 2016, turnout in the Democratic caucuses was down roughly a third from four years ago and 57% from 2008.
Reporting issues have plagued the Iowa Democratic Party, and the Associated Press
hasn't declared a winner of the caucuses
. Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg had a razor-thin edge over Mr. Sanders with state delegate equivalents, the metric that state and national party officials say is most important. Mr. Sanders nonetheless declared victory based on a lead in the popular vote.
Irregularities in the results released by the state party make it difficult to perform a reliable precinct-by-precinct analysis, but the tallies revealed some broad trends.
Mr. Buttigieg, who has sought to appeal to moderates in the party, performed well across swaths of the state, winning many rural areas. The 38-year-old also did well in the suburban areas of Des Moines.
Mr. Sanders, a self-described Democratic socialist, drove up his support in college towns and population centers such as Cedar Rapids and Sioux City.
Mr. Sanders had hinged his strategy on motivating large numbers of new voters, saying in the final weeks before the Iowa caucuses that the
results would be revealed early
—if turnout was high he would win, he said; if it was low he would lose. Mr. Sanders also says that he is the strongest candidate to beat Mr. Trump because he can expand the electorate.
The Sanders campaign said he won 11 of 15 precincts where more than 20% of registered voters were under 23 years old, and aides to his campaign directly attributed his margin of victory in the popular vote to an increase in youth turnout. 





According to entrance polls, Sen. Bernie Sanders carried 48% of voters between the ages of 17 and 29. PHOTO: Christopher Lee for The Wall Street Journal
During a press conference Thursday, Mr. Sanders said he was concerned that voters stayed home but felt optimistic that young voters would show up in November.
Based on entrance polls, voters between the ages of 17 and 29 accounted for 24% of the Democratic electorate in this year's caucuses. In 2016, they made up
18% of Democratic voters
, and in
2008, it was 23%
.
According to those entrance polls, Mr. Sanders carried 48% of voters between the ages of 17 and 29. Mr. Buttigieg, who would be the youngest president in U.S. history if elected, earned support from 19% of caucus-goers in that age group. Twelve percent backed Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
Iowa's population is predominantly white, but the Sanders campaign also held events in areas with sizable Latino communities. Mr. Sanders's campaign said that helped him do well in
so-called satellite caucuses
, which were held for the first time this year in addition to the traditional precinct gatherings. Some satellite caucuses were conducted in English and Spanish.
In New Hampshire, which will hold its primary on Feb. 11, Mr. Sanders returned to his focus on turnout—though he wasn't tying his own fate to the numbers there.
""Let's have the largest voter turnout in New Hampshire primary history,"" he said at a town hall in Derry.

WASHINGTON—House lawmakers are readying to campaign in the post-impeachment landscape, with Democrats eager to focus on policy issues and Republicans planning to attack swing-district Democrats for voting to remove a president whom many of their constituents support.
Democrats plan to defend the majority, and specifically their 30 seats in districts that Mr. Trump won in 2016, by discussing the issue that gave them the gavel in 2018: lowering health-care costs. Lawmakers expect to stay far away from talking about the two articles of impeachment the
House passed against the president
in December.
Republicans, meanwhile, will largely embrace running on the ballot alongside Mr. Trump. Their message will be national: attacking Democrats for impeachment and tying themselves to successes in the economy and the president.
""The Democrats who voted for impeachment from districts that Trump won with a majority are in serious trouble,"" said David Wasserman, the House race analyst from the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. Twelve House Democrats won in districts where the president won more than 50% of the vote, while 18 Democrats took districts that Mr. Trump won with a plurality.
Republicans credit the impeachment investigation for boosting fundraising. In the first six weeks of this year, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has raised over $1.5 million online, according to an aide. By comparison, he raised $1.3 million in the final quarter of 2019.
""They are going to lose the House because they haven't accomplished anything.... They made a promise to the American people that they were going to be different,"" Mr. McCarthy (R., Calif.) said of Democrats on Thursday. He plans to meet with donors in Key Biscayne, Fla., this weekend, along with 50 House GOP members.
Mr. Wasserman said it is more likely that Republicans pick up a few seats, but not enough to win the majority.
Democrats counter that they have passed hundreds of bills, and laid out a legislative agenda that largely hasn't been taken up by the GOP-controlled Senate. Democrats expecting competitive races spent the off-year building war chests for a year where they will have to campaign in areas that Mr. Trump won in 2016. The House Democrats' campaign arm raised $125 million in 2019 and outraised the National Republican Congressional Committee every month, according to information from the committees. That shifted in January when the NRCC bested the Democrats.
Republican incumbents have been admonished by leadership for low fundraising numbers. NRCC Chairman Rep. Tom Emmer (R., Minn.) said last month that ""members need to get their act together and raise more money.""
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Which party do you think has the most momentum in the battle for control of the House? Why? Join the conversation below.
""Our members and candidates need to get better with their individual fundraising so the NRCC can go on offense this fall,"" said NRCC spokesman Chris Pack. ""If we're playing defense in seats, that significantly hinders our chance to make a run at the majority.""
While Republicans need to win a net of 18 seats to take the majority, Democrats will benefit from North Carolina redistricting that puts two seats in their favor and four
Republican retirements
in swing districts in Texas and Georgia. Republicans acknowledge that they will likely need to win 25 seats to compensate for those expected Democratic wins, an unlikely effort.
Last year, vulnerable Democrats raised a collective $93 million, with 13 of those lawmakers having over $2 million in cash to spend on their re-election. None plan to focus on impeachment on the campaign trail, and they say the
effort to punish the president
for pushing a foreign power to investigate his rivals doesn't come up when they talk to constituents.
""No one's talking to me about impeachment,"" said Rep. Haley Stevens (D., Mich.).
Democrats who won GOP-held seats in 2018 are more frantic about Sen. Bernie Sanders's strong showing in the first two presidential primary contests than impeachment attacks and they see the self-proclaimed democratic socialist's rise as putting the majority at risk.
""I do worry, if Bernie Sanders is at the top of the ticket, the impact it will have all the way down,"" said Rep. Dina Titus (D., Nev.), who is backing former Vice President Joe Biden.
The House Republican Conference was left with just 13 women lawmakers after losses in 2018, but a record-breaking number of Republican women are running for office this cycle, after a widespread effort by the party and groups such as Winning for Women, the first GOP super PAC dedicated solely to electing women. Nine of the 13 seats the Republicans see as top targets in November have a viable woman running in the primary.
Still, several Republican strategists concede that they have failed to recruit strong candidates in districts that could have been more winnable, such as those of Rep. Antonio Delgado in New York and Ms. Stevens in Michigan.
While the big landmark bills that Democrats have highlighted this year, such as a bill to
lower the cost of prescription drugs
or
expanding background checks
for gun purchases, have languished in the Senate and have little chance of becoming law, several House Democrats can tout minor legislative success uniquely focused on their districts.
Several pieces of legislation including the National Defense Authorization Act gave freshmen lawmakers something to point to. For example, Rep. Anthony Brindisi of New York pushed a bill that requires the Department of Defense to purchase American-made flatware and dinnerware for service members, legislation that will benefit manufacturing in his district.

In his first appearance on a debate stage in the Democratic presidential-primary race, Michael Bloomberg apologized, rolled his eyes, occasionally got booed and stayed mostly silent unless he was responding to an attack from another candidate.
The former New York City mayor, who has been on the
rise in recent polls
after
$417 million in ad spending
, was grilled by moderators and his Democratic rivals at the Las Vegas debate on a laundry list of issues his campaign knew would be problematic for him, according to people familiar with it. Those included a controversial policing tactic under his administration known as stop-and-frisk and
recently released audio of him defending it
, his comments regarding a biased housing practice, and lawsuits from women who worked for his company alleging sexual discrimination and harassment.
In round one with his Democratic rivals, Mr. Bloomberg was unable to quash questions on those issues, meaning they are likely to come up again in two more debates planned in the coming weeks and could see new scrutiny from voters and the media ahead of the March 3 Super Tuesday primaries on which he has bet his candidacy.
The billionaire hadn't participated in a debate since 2009, when he was running for a third mayoral term. Unlike other candidates, Mr. Bloomberg doesn't take questions from voters at his campaign events—although his advisers said after the debate Wednesday that could change soon. He often uses a teleprompter at his events to give a short speech—usually under 15 minutes long—before moving to his next stop.
Still, many voters' knowledge of his candidacy likely comes from his extensive advertising spending, which totals $131.6 million in Super Tuesday states alone on TV and radio, according to Kantar/CMAG. A recent multimillion-dollar TV campaign portrays him as having a close bond with former President Obama, though the two have had a complicated relationship.
Mr. Bloomberg, who is self-funding his run for the nomination, poured $463.8 million into his campaign between late November and the end of last month, according to a Federal Election Commission report filed Thursday. The sum doesn't include the amount he put into ads and payroll in February, when he doubled his ad spending and number of staff.
Wednesday's debate was the most-watched Democratic debate ever, according to Nielsen Fast National Data. The two-hour event averaged 19.7 million television viewers on NBC News and MSNBC. The live stream generated nearly 22 million video views across all platforms, averaging 417,000 views across those platforms.
On Wednesday, the attacks on Mr. Bloomberg started early and continued throughout the debate, with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren setting the tone in the first few minutes. ""I'd like to talk about who we are running against: a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians, and no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump,"" she said. ""I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg.""
Mr. Bloomberg backed Ms. Warren's opponent, Republican Sen. Scott Brown, when she first ran for her seat.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What, if anything, surprised you from Michael Bloomberg during his first Democratic debate? Join the conversation below.
Throughout the debate, he stressed his management experience, repeated his apology over stop-and-frisk—which gave police officers wide latitude to stop people whom they suspected of criminal behavior—and argued he was best positioned to take on Mr. Trump.
""I know how to take on an arrogant con man like Donald Trump that comes from New York. I'm a mayor. I was a mayor. I know how to run a complicated city, the biggest, most diverse city in this country,"" he said.
""I'm a manager. I knew what to do after 9/11 and brought the city back stronger than ever. And I'm a philanthropist who didn't inherit his money, but made his money, and I'm spending that money to get rid of Donald Trump, the worst president we have ever had.""
Mr. Bloomberg stumbled his way through some responses and at times provided fodder for future attacks. ""None of them accuse me of doing anything other than maybe they didn't like a joke I told,"" he said when pushed on the allegations in lawsuits against his financial-data and media company and whether he would release some former employees from nondisclosure agreements. He said the deals had been reached ""consensually,"" which drew groans from the audience.
Asked about when he would release his tax returns, he said he would do so but said his enormous wealth meant it would take time and that he couldn't use TurboTax.
Mr. Trump, who watched the Democratic debate from Air Force One during a trip west, repeatedly criticized Mr. Bloomberg on Twitter, calling his performance ""perhaps the worst in the history of debates.""
""He was stumbling, bumbling and grossly incompetent,"" said Mr. Trump, who has been closely following the Democratic primary. ""If this doesn't knock him out of the race, nothing will. Not so easy to do what I did!""
At a campaign event in Salt Lake City, Utah—a Super Tuesday state—on Thursday, Mr. Bloomberg said Mr. Trump was the ""real winner"" of Wednesday night's debate. He veered off his usual speech to also draw a contrast with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
""I worry that we may very well be on the way to nominating somebody who cannot win in November,"" he said. ""And if we choose a candidate who appeals to a small base, like Sen. Sanders, it will be a fatal error.""
Mr. Bloomberg's team was expecting the first hour of the debate to be particularly rough for the mayor, a top aide said, arguing that Wednesday's debate performance wouldn't change the fundamentals of the race. After the first two nominating contests, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign has made the case that only he and Mr. Sanders—the national leader in a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll this week—have a viable path to the Democratic nomination. The former mayor, however, has yet to appear on a ballot.
Mr. Bloomberg's advisers said that in the second half of the debate he successfully targeted Mr. Sanders, a self-described Democratic socialist. ""What a wonderful country we have,"" the billionaire said during the debate. ""The best-known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses.""
Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to Mr. Bloomberg who played Mr. Sanders during debate prep, said Mr. Bloomberg was the first candidate to challenge Mr. Sanders on the debate stage. ""After a year of debating in which no one was able to draw a real contrast with Bernie Sanders, everyone was tiptoeing around his record, everyone was afraid to take him on, Mike Bloomberg was the first person to really sort of do that.""
Mr. Bloomberg kept a light campaign schedule ahead of Wednesday's debate so that he could spend his time prepping in case he met the Democratic National Committee's polling criteria, according to people familiar with his planning. He hit the threshold the day before the debate.
The former mayor will also continue to prioritize debate prep over campaigning before the next debate in South Carolina next week, those people said. ""Mike is a very analytical, data-driven person,"" Mr. Wolfson said. ""I am sure that he will assess his own performance and make whatever adjustments are necessary.""
As some of the other candidates lingered on the stage after the debate, waving and shaking hands with more people, Mr. Bloomberg escaped backstage.

WASHINGTON—President Trump's advisers are pondering the prospect of facing off against another antiestablishment candidate armed with giant rallies, loyal supporters and bold promises.
As Bernie Sanders gains strength in the Democratic presidential primary, Mr. Trump's aides and allies largely welcome a general election matchup with the self-avowed socialist. Still, some also acknowledge that the Vermont senator, who narrowly
won the New Hampshire Democratic primary
this week and leads in national polls of the Democratic nomination contest, would enter the race with momentum and some key similarities to the president.
Mr. Trump said as much Tuesday in the Oval Office, by way of criticizing former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

What issues do you think would dominate a race between President Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders? Join the conversation below.
""Frankly, I'd rather run against Bloomberg than Bernie Sanders, because Sanders has real followers—whether you like him or not, whether you agree with him or not,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I happen to think it's terrible what he says. But he has followers.""
Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders have attracted passionate supporters, who flock to their rock-concert like rallies. That similarity was on display on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, when Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders
held dueling rallies in the state
. The president drew more than 11,000 supporters in Manchester and the senator more than 7,500 in Durham.
To the president, a political outsider who sees his massive rallies and loyal base as key to his electoral strength, Mr. Sanders's crowds are noteworthy. Like Mr. Trump, the senator is also a nontraditional figure who argues
he can expand the electorate
by energizing new voters with his message.
Rep. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.), who is Mr. Sanders's national campaign co-chair, stressed the senator's support on Fox News Wednesday.
""So he is building the type of coalition that can really defeat Donald Trump. And Trump actually understands it,"" Mr. Khanna said. ""I mean, Trump understands the power of crowds, he understands the power of having an online following. And he is right to recognize that Bernie Sanders is the person on the other side who's building that.""
After the New Hampshire results came in, Mr. Sanders told supporters that ""this victory here is the beginning of the end for Donald Trump.""
He later added: ""Our campaign is not just about beating Trump, it is about transforming this country.""
Polling shows Mr. Sanders, whose campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, performing similarly to others in the Democratic race in hypothetical matchups with Mr. Trump. A recent WSJ/NBC poll showed Mr. Sanders leading Mr. Trump 49% to 46%.
For months, the Trump campaign has openly relished the prospect of running against Mr. Sanders, actively seeking to elevate him with commentary and social media posts suggesting he was being disenfranchised by the Democratic Party.
People with knowledge of campaign and White House thinking said Mr. Sanders was viewed as the Democratic candidate who generated significant voter enthusiasm, with his highly motivated base of support. While they consider him beatable and many said they welcome the contrast, some also characterized him as a candidate who could appeal as Mr. Trump did in 2016.
But Trump's allies also argue that Mr. Sanders's policies, including Medicare for All, may lean too far left for much of the electorate,
particularly the suburban voters
who helped power Democratic wins in 2018.
""He's always been my first choice"" to run against, said former 2016 Trump campaign aide Barry Bennett. ""I just think he is the starkest contrast. … I just don't think that a candidate that far left has much appeal outside of California and New York.""
Democratic strategist Jim Manley said Mr. Sanders provided a lot of opportunities for Republicans to attack.
""I get the idea that Team Trump is going to go low no matter who we put up, but I for one think Sen. Sanders is going to be a really target-rich environment for a lot of Trump folks, starting with the president,"" he said. But he added: ""They need to take him seriously because just like Trump he's got a movement around him, and he's very good at painting his opponents as the enemy.""
Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh characterized Mr. Sanders as the ""Democratic front-runner and has been the intellectual leader of his party in this campaign."" He argued that whoever the eventual candidate is, ""Bernie's mark on the race has been to dictate the issues that are required for Democrats to embrace.""
Just how this face-off could affect the electoral map remains uncertain. Mr. Sanders is viewed as a strong contender in some key battleground states, including Michigan and Wisconsin, which Mr. Trump captured in 2016 with a similar message on trade and manufacturing.
But his liberal views on issues like taxes and health care
may prove a tougher sell in other states
Democrats are hoping to put in play, like Georgia. Mr. Sanders and his allies say his policies are more popular with the general public than Republicans contend.
White House counselor Kellyanne Conway also stressed that Mr. Trump will be running on a record in 2020.
""Bernie is still in the promising stage, and the president has delivery and results on trade deals with China, with Mexico, with Japan,"" she said. ""Now it's the difference between the progressive and the progress report.""

RENO, Nev.—Democratic presidential contenders are blitzing Nevada in the final week before the
state's caucuses
, a contest that could determine whether Sen. Bernie Sanders has staying power at the top of the pack and whether centrists will rally behind an alternative or remain splintered.
As they made appearances across the state, the candidates are preparing for a Wednesday night debate in Las Vegas that could include the debut of billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has poured more than $400 million into his campaign with an eye toward the Super Tuesday states next month.
Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator and self-described democratic socialist, and Pete Buttigieg, the former South Bend, Ind., mayor, emerged as the leading contenders after

Iowa and New Hampshire
. But Nevada's contest this Saturday, which features a large Latino electorate, and South Carolina's, the first with a large African-American voting population, will test whether Messrs. Sanders and Buttigieg can appeal to a more diverse electorate.
""If we have, as I hope we will, the highest voter turnout in the history of the Nevada caucus, we're going to win here in Nevada,"" Mr. Sanders said during a Sunday rally in Carson City.
In a sign of his strength, Mr. Sanders has been campaigning in recent days in a series of Super Tuesday states, set to vote March 3, including California, Colorado, North Carolina and Texas. He was holding a Monday night rally in Tacoma, Wash.
Mr. Buttigieg hopes to use Nevada as a springboard to consolidate support among centrists, hoping to fend off an energized Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who finished third in New Hampshire, and a faltering former Vice President Joe Biden, who finished fifth.
But with Mr. Bloomberg's addition to the ballot looming after South Carolina, a failure to do so by Mr. Buttigieg might allow Mr. Sanders to accumulate an early lead in the chase for delegates to the party's summer convention. Recent polls show Mr. Sanders leading in Nevada, a state he narrowly lost to Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Mr. Buttigieg, a 38-year-old military veteran, has sought to present himself as a candidate who could bring together the disparate factions within the party and present a striking alternative to President Trump. He has tussled with Mr. Sanders on a central issue of the campaign: Medicare for All, in which the party's left wants to move everyone from private insurance to government-provided health coverage, while centrists call for a more gradual shift.
""A campaign message that says that you've either got to be for the revolution or you must be for the status quo, most of us don't know where we fit in that picture,"" Mr. Buttigieg said in Reno on Monday. ""I'm here to draw a bigger picture, one where all of us can belong.""
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, is seeking to use Nevada to rejuvenate her campaign
after disappointing finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire
, which borders her home state.
Another factor: the mechanics of the caucus in Nevada. After
voter-tabulation problems delayed Iowa's caucus
results, campaigns are nervous that
Nevada may face similar problems
despite assurances from state party officials that they are prepared and have learned from Iowa's mistakes.
An inconclusive outcome in Nevada—either overall or amid the centrist bloc—could benefit Mr. Bloomberg, who is campaigning as a well-funded counterweight to Mr. Trump and skipped the first four races in favor of Super Tuesday primaries and beyond.
The billionaire could qualify for Wednesday's debate in Las Vegas if he achieves one more qualifying national poll showing him with at least 10% support—he already has notched three such polls. Mr. Bloomberg is preparing for the debate Wednesday in case he meets the polling criteria, according to people familiar with his planning.
But several Democrats in the field are sharpening their attacks of Mr. Bloomberg ahead of the debate, pointing to his Republican past and lack of support for President Obama during the 2008 election.
Mr. Sanders, who has drawn thousands to his rallies, over the weekend highlighted Mr. Bloomberg's past views on law enforcement and questioned his ability to harness a massive turnout that the senator argues will be necessary to defeat Mr. Trump. At an event in Las Vegas, Mr. Sanders said the party wouldn't be able to ""create the energy and excitement we need to defeat Donald Trump if that candidate pursued, advocated for and enacted racist policies like stop-and-frisk, which caused communities of color in his city to live in fear.""
Mr. Sanders was referring to practices in which New York police officers received broad authority to stop and search people whom they suspected of criminal behavior.
Mr. Bloomberg has since apologized
for his administration's use of the tactic and offered regret last week when audio of him defending the procedure in 2015 was shared on social media.
Kevin Sheekey, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign manager, said it was ""a shameful turn of events to see Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump deploy the very same attacks and tactics against Mike, but the reason is clear. At this point, the primary is Bernie's to lose, and ours to win.""
Mr. Biden is seeking to reset his campaign in the next two contests, arguing that black and Latino voters have yet to influence the Democratic primaries. But polls have shown that his tepid support in Iowa and New Hampshire has
weakened his standing among black voters in South Carolina
, raising the stakes for him in Nevada.
During a New York City fundraiser last week, Mr. Biden told donors he was confident he would win the South Carolina primary and place first or second in Nevada. But even some of his supporters have their doubts.
During an event at a Reno middle school on Monday, Roger Scime, a guitar and vocal instructor, told the former vice president that he was ""smart"" and ""experienced,"" and that if he won the nomination it would be ""Mr. Rogers versus Darth Vader,"" with Mr. Trump as the Star Wars villain. But Mr. Scime said he wondered about the future of Mr. Biden's campaign.
Mr. Biden responded that he knew Iowa would be a difficult place for him to win because ""it's all white, it's all Midwestern,"" but he said he had broad support from black and Latino voters.
""We're now getting into the thick of it,"" he said, adding that former President Clinton lost about a dozen contests in 1992 but still won the nomination. ""I'm not counting on waiting that long,"" he said to laughter.

Joe Biden swept to victories in the key state of Michigan along with Missouri and Mississippi in Tuesday's round of presidential nominating contests, building his delegate lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders with a coalition of African-Americans, suburbanites and older voters.
Opening a new phase in the race, the former vice president put distance between himself and Mr. Sanders -- and built upon his momentum from wins in 10 Super Tuesday stateslast week.
Mr. Biden quickly sought to unite the party after prevailing in Michigan, which offered 125 delegates, the biggest prize of the night. The results in Washington, the second-biggest delegate haul of the day, were too close to call. North Dakota and Idaho were also holding contests.
""I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion,"" Mr. Biden told supporters in Philadelphia. ""We share a common goal and together, we'll defeat Donald Trump, we'll defeat him together.""
Mr. Biden has presented himself as the Democrat best able to challenge President Trump in general-election battlegrounds such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, which was the first of those states to weigh in on the Democratic race. His win there, by one measure, is his most significant yet and could bolster his argument that he should be the party's nominee.
With 64% of Michigan precincts reporting, Mr. Biden had about 53% of the vote to about 38% for Mr. Sanders.
Mr. Biden was projected the winner in Mississippi and Missouri by the Associated Press shortly after the states' polls closed, an early sign of his clout in two states with large African-American voting blocs.
Black voters made up about two-thirds of the electorate in Mississippi, according to exit polls. Mr. Biden had won more than 80% of support in the state, with 89% of precincts reporting.
Mr. Biden, who served under President Obama, campaigned ahead of the Missouri primary among African-Americans in St. Louis and Kansas City. With 93% of precincts reporting, Mr. Biden had about 60% of the vote in Missouri.
Mr. Sanders returned to his home in Burlington, Vt., and did not speak publicly after the election results. A campaign aide said he intended to participate in Sunday's debate in Phoenix.
Mr. Biden entered Tuesday with a delegate edge of 670 to 574 over Mr. Sanders, according to a Wall Street Journal delegate tracker, even as Super Tuesday states such as California and Colorado, which Mr. Sanders carried, continue to process election results.
Mr. Sanders was seeking to steady his campaign after Mr. Bidenconsolidated the support of party moderates following his victory in the South Carolina primary last month. Some in the party's establishment have expressed fears that Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who won the New Hampshire and Nevada contests, would be too liberal for many voters in the general election.
The campaigns competed for votes against the backdrop of growing economic concerns over the spread of the coronavirus.
Messrs. Sanders and Biden both canceled rallies in Cleveland Tuesday, ahead of Ohio's primary next week, citing public-health concerns. Both candidates havequestioned Mr. Trump's handling of the crisisin recent days. The Democratic National Committee also said it would have no live audience at the Phoenix debate, in response to concerns about the outbreak.
Exit polls showed Mr. Biden winning handily among black and older voters and performing well with voters who had at least a college degree. Mr. Biden was also prevailing in cities such as St. Louis, Kansas City and Detroit and in their surrounding suburban areas, including Oakland County, Mich.
Mr. Sanders was maintaining a substantial advantage over Mr. Biden among young voters, exit polls showed, more evidence that the former vice president would need to improve his standing with that group if he became the party's nominee.
The Vermont senator has staked much of his campaign on motivating the young -- and others disenchanted with current politics -- to come to the polls.
Mr. Sanders went into Tuesday with high hopes for Michigan, where he narrowly defeated the eventual nominee, Hillary Clinton, in 2016. Mr. Trump beat Mrs. Clinton in the state in the general election, becoming the first Republican to carry Michigan since 1988.
Michigan's secretary of state warned that the full results might not be known until Wednesday due in part to a spike in absentee-ballot requests.
In Michigan on Tuesday, Mr. Biden defended his support of the Second Amendment in a heated exchange with an auto worker and later spoke of the Obama administration's bailout of General Motors and Chrysler, two titans of the state's auto industry, more than a decade ago.
""We bet on you,"" Mr. Biden said during a visit to a Fiat Chrysler assembly plant in Detroit. ""If I end up being the president, you'll never have a better friend in the White House.""
During a Detroit rally on the eve of the primary, Mr. Biden was joined by Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, two former presidential rivals who recently endorsed Mr. Biden's candidacy.
The pair -- who have been discussed by some Democrats as potential running mates for Mr. Biden if he wins the nomination -- could help him appeal to black voters in the state.
Mr. Sanders courted voters at a Dearborn Heights, Mich., polling place on Tuesday, repeating criticisms he has raised about Mr. Biden's record, including the former Delaware senator's past support for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Mr. Sanders told reporters that Michigan was ""obviously a very important state"" but that he thinks every state is important to try to win.
""When our record is compared to Biden's, when our vision is compared to Biden's, when we have that debate in Phoenix, I'm feeling pretty good,"" Mr. Sanders said.
Tuesday's contests served as the first opportunity for voters to consider a one-on-one choice between Messrs. Biden and Sanders after other candidates dropped out. In the last two weeks, billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg all exited the race and endorsed Mr. Biden.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii) was still seeking the nomination but has been unable to break out of single-digit percentages in polling.
Mr. Biden has largely sought to avoid confrontation with Mr. Sanders.
But in his stump speech, the former vice president has pointed out that it is he, and not the senator, who has so far driven up turnout in primaries.
""Sen. Sanders likes to say, 'We need a record turnout to beat Donald Trump.' He's absolutely right,"" Mr. Biden has told audiences in recent days, rattling off Super Tuesday turnout boosts in Virginia, Texas and North Carolina.
""Guess who they voted for? They voted for us,"" Mr. Biden said.

OXON HILL, Md.—The impeachment of President Trump motivated her to fly up from Texas, but after a half day at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Cathie Broten was convinced a more sinister force is in play.
""It's like Custer's Last Stand: the Republicans vs. the socialists,"" said Ms. Broten, 70 years old, wearing a pin reading, ""Kiss me, I'm a capitalist.""
""We need to stand up and fight,"" she said Thursday. ""Somebody's got to pay for the free TV, the free college. It's time to draw the line.""
While Mr. Trump is certain to be greeted by rapturous applause when he addresses CPAC on Saturday afternoon, another name has featured as prominently as the president's during the four-day conference in suburban Washington: Sen. Bernie Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist and front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.
""I have two words for you: Socialism sucks,"" Trump campaign adviser Mercedes Schlapp told an audience of hundreds. ""We have to stop it in its tracks.""
The CPAC theme—America vs. Socialism—reveals how Republicans plan to frame the November election, with or without Mr. Sanders as the nominee. Repeatedly, speakers portrayed the Democrats' agenda on health care, the environment, college tuition and other issues as an attempt to radically transform America.
""Donald Trump and his allies are getting a little bit nervous about facing Sen. Sanders in a general election, and they're all quickly realizing that the only way to attack someone who spent his entire life standing with the working class is to lie,"" said Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca.
Amid the ""crazy Bernie"" and communist Cuba references at CPAC were warnings about being overconfident.
""Get your laughs out of the way and get the mockery out of the way and then get deathly serious,"" said the young conservative activist Charlie Kirk. ""Because we should not do what the left did in 2016 and dismiss an outsider populist candidate from thinking that person can't win the White House.""
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How can President Trump's relationship with CPAC benefit him during the 2020 election season? Join the conversation below.
When Mr. Trump spoke at CPAC in 2011, saying he might run for president the following year, many in the Republican establishment laughed it off as a publicity grab. He skipped it in 2016 while some conservatives still fought to prevent his march to the nomination.
This year showed how Mr. Trump commands the GOP, injecting his own sense of grievance and fight. The mere mention of Mitt Romney, the party's 2012 nominee who
voted earlier this month in the Senate to convict Mr. Trump
on one article of impeachment, brought boos. Conference-goers stuffed ballot boxes to judge the ""phoniest"" conservative, picking from a list of other Republicans who have criticized Mr. Trump.
Before noon on Thursday, attendees had sat through four panels focused on ""the coup,"" with speakers dismissing the impeachment and other investigations into Mr. Trump as the work of Democrats and a bureaucratic deep state.
""They're never going to stop,"" said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio. ""They tried to overturn the will of 63 million Americans—all of us who voted for President Trump.""
Democrats hit back at claims like Mr. Jordan's, calling it ""the oldest trick in the GOP playbook.""
""Republicans are trying to distract because they know they can't win on the issues. In 2017, 2018 and 2019 Democrats won on a message of expanding access to health care,"" said Daniel Wessel, a Democratic National Committee spokesman.
In addition to panels, actors Dean Cain and Kristy Swanson performed a dramatic reading of anti-Trump text messages between former FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, favorite targets of Mr. Trump in his complaints about the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
The CPAC gathering in past years was animated by Ron Paul-style libertarians; now it is dominated by Trump loyalists in red MAGA hats as the president continues to redefine the GOP on foreign policy and trade. There was little mention of the ballooning national debt.
For some, it was a venue to apologize for being wrong about Mr. Trump in 2016.
""Look, I was late to the Trump train,"" said Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. ""I was about as late as one can be. I had my doubts about whether he was a conservative. I had my doubts about whether he was electable."" But Mr. Lee said the president has followed through on his promises, including moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, slashing regulations and nominating conservative judges.
Vice President Mike Pence ticked off those accomplishments and the strong economy and
declared victory over the impeachment
. ""President Donald Trump was acquitted forever,"" he said to wild cheers. Like others, Mr. Pence acknowledged the appeal of Mr. Sanders's policy proposals to young people in particular and said Republicans must engage them and explain the differences between ""freedom and socialism.""
""We definitely need to a better job of reaching young people and address their concerns,"" said Alexander Bowles, 18, of St. Louis, who said Mr. Trump also should moderate the way he speaks to avoid losing more suburban voters.
Outside the ballroom, people who have become celebrities in the Trump era were flocked by fans. Biceps poking from a black T-shirt, the Fox News regular Dan Bongino posed for selfies. Nigel Farage, one of Brexit's most-visible architects, was greeted with applause as he rode down an escalator holding a wooden doll depicting Mr. Trump.
Vendors sold Trump hats, towels, T-shirts and pins. A red-white-and-blue hammock with the word ""Deplorable"" was being offered at 10% off the $499 price tag with an extra 10% discount for anyone from a battleground state.
At a booth sponsored by the NRA, young activists posed with cutouts of a diminutive Michael Bloomberg, a nod to Mr. Trump's nickname for the Democratic presidential contender—""mini Mike.""
Mr. Trump is scheduled to address CPAC at 3 p.m. Saturday. Last year he took the stage, hugged an American flag and delivered a speech that lasted more than two hours.

MILWAUKEE—As six Democratic candidates faced off in Iowa on Tuesday evening, President Trump, less than 400 miles away, sought to insert himself into the process at a rally for his reelection campaign.
Former Vice President Joe Biden? ""Sleepy."" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren? ""Not going anywhere.""
But Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders? ""Surging.""
Trump campaign aides and political allies view Mr. Sanders, a self-declared socialist, as an easier opponent than other potential contenders. Mr. Trump has tweeted about Mr. Sanders twice this week, saying on Sunday that he was ""looking very good"" and stoking the
clash between the two leading liberals
in the race. ""Elizabeth is very angry at Bernie. Do I see a feud brewing?"" he
tweeted
Monday.
Mr. Sanders has
ticked up in recent national polls
, but is separated from Messrs. Biden and Warren by a few percentage points. Unlike Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders has never polled above 30% among Democrats nationally in this election cycle.
The president also sided with Mr. Sanders in a growing clash between him and Ms. Warren over whether the Vermont senator told Ms. Warren in a 2018 meeting that he didn't believe a woman could win the election. Mr. Warren confirmed that characterization after it was reported by CNN; Mr. Sanders has denied it.
""I don't believe that he said this,"" Mr. Trump told a packed arena in Milwaukee. ""I don't particularly like him, the nasty guy, but…[it's] not the kind of thing he'd say.""
Mr. Trump had low expectations for the Democrats' face-off. ""Nobody is watching,"" he said. ""They haven't been doing great on the debates, I have to tell you.""
Mr. Trump also sought to create a split screen between his actions as president and Democrats' efforts to oust him from office, a strategy that campaign aides have said they intend to pursue over the course of the election year.
""While we're creating jobs and killing terrorists, Democrats in Congress are wasting America's time with demented, hoaxes and crazy witch hunts,"" the president said.
The House is set to vote Wednesday to name impeachment managers and send the articles of impeachment to the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said he expects to
start the president's impeachment trial next Tuesday
, when Mr. Trump is scheduled to be in Davos, Switzerland, for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum.
Tuesday's rally marked the president's second of the election year and his first time in Wisconsin since July, when he traveled to Milwaukee to give a speech on trade.
Wisconsin, a state Mr. Trump won in 2016 by fewer than 23,000 votes, is a key battleground in the 2020 race. Top Democrats had already collectively t
raveled to the state 10 times
by September, and Wisconsin is one of four states where a top Democratic group, Priorities USA, plans to spend $150 million before the convention this summer in Milwaukee.
The Trump campaign has also signaled it plans to make Wisconsin a priority. Lara Trump, a senior adviser to the campaign and the president's daughter-in-law, traveled there for an event Monday. Jared Kushner, a senior White House adviser and the president's son-in-law, was also in Milwaukee on Tuesday for a criminal justice event.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's pragmatic, can-do appeal to a diverse electorate helped propel her to the governor's mansion. Some Democrats including Joe Biden, whom Ms. Whitmer recently endorsed, hope the same formula can help them win back the state in the presidential election.
Ms. Whitmer and a host of freshman Democratic U.S. House members from across the state won over moderates in areas around Detroit in 2018 that had been Republican strongholds. At the same time, Ms. Whitmer benefited from increased turnout in Wayne County, home to Detroit, a predominantly black city that is also the state's largest.
That is a reversal from 2016, when President Trump won the state on strong support in white rural areas while Hillary Clinton couldn't match Barack Obama's turnout in majority-black areas. If Mr. Biden wins Michigan's primary Tuesday it will help demonstrate her influence in a crucial general election state, where Ms. Whitmer is already trying to quash chatter she is a contender for the vice president spot on the Democratic ticket.
""By the time we get to November, turnout's going to be high,"" Ms. Whitmer said in an interview, calling the low Democratic turnout in 2016 ""an anomaly."" ""We carried the biggest counties that people look to as deciding the Trump election in 2016, and so we are, I think, poised to have a big turnout,"" she said.
Jessica Taylor, who analyzes governor races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said swing-state Democrats should replicate Ms. Whitmer's appeal to broad kitchen-table issues such as infrastructure.
""She ran with 'fix the damn roads,'"" Ms. Taylor said.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What role do you see Ms. Whitmer playing in the 2020 election? Join the conversation below.
Ms. Whitmer and her lieutenant governor, Garlin Gilchrist II, recently endorsed Mr. Biden for president ahead of the state's primary on Tuesday. Mr. Gilchrist predicted Mr. Biden would be able to win Michigan in a general election because he has thus far in the primary appealed to the political coalition that he and Ms. Whitmer assembled in 2018. In recent primaries, Mr. Biden has won states where black voters make up a significant chunk of the electorate. Exit polls and vote results suggest he has brought former Republican suburbanites into the Democratic primary.
""Black Democrats are inspired by people who show up,"" said Mr. Gilchrist, the first black American to attain his office. ""As a black Democrat who lives in Detroit, I think it's important that [people] know that the person who we're supporting, Vice President Joe Biden, is stepping up.""
Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a freshman lawmaker who ousted a Republican incumbent in a district that includes a swath of Detroit suburbia, said that Ms. Whitmer's election displayed a formula for victory in Michigan: Unite swing voters with a party's core base of support.
""That's how Barack Obama won here, that's how Bill Clinton won here, I think that's how Gov. Whitmer won,"" Ms. Slotkin said. ""It's not one or the other, and I think there's a false between saying you can only focus on base Democratic voters or swing voters. The job is to approach both.""
Indeed, national Democrats have taken note of how Ms. Whitmer and Mr. Gilchrist ran in 2018.
""Michigan is a critical battleground and we are following the roadmap that successful Democrats made in 2018, like Gov. Whitmer, to compete everywhere, invest early and talk about issues that are essential to voters' lives"" like the cost of prescription drugs, said DNC spokesman David Bergstein.
However, just as the national political landscape is a tough environment for bipartisanship, Ms. Whitmer has seen her fair share of quarrels with Republicans in her state.
The Republican-controlled statehouse rejected her proposed gasoline tax, which she would have used to pay for road work, leaving her ""fix the damn roads"" promise largely unfulfilled. The Republicans said the proposal amounted to typical Democratic politics. ""Whether it's a ridiculous 45 cent gas tax increase or massive debt spending, Gretchen Whitmer has proven that she is just another tax and spend Democrat like Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders,"" said RNC spokesperson Michael Joyce.
Ms. Whitmer has instead relied on executive actions, which she has acknowledged are less sweeping than reforms possible with lawmakers.
She is also no stranger to controversy. One of the most high-profile flashpoints from her first year in office came when black leaders pushed back against her plan to close a predominantly black high school in Benton Harbor, a small town in the state's southwest corner along Lake Michigan.
Ms. Slotkin, the congresswoman, said that national Democrats should embrace Midwestern politicians like Ms. Whitmer, if not least for the sake of broadening the party's appeal beyond urban enclaves—especially on the coasts.
""I'm keenly aware that lots of political leaders from both parties tend to be from the coasts or from places that are deep red or deep blue,"" Ms. Slotkin said, calling any politician from a swing state an asset to the Democratic ticket.
Democratic operatives say buzz about Ms. Whitmer's future in the party is bound to grow—especially if Mr. Biden becomes the party's nominee. Ms. Whitmer has played down speculation she has sights on higher office.
""I am not angling to leave the state of Michigan. I've been governor for 14 months, I've got a lot of work to do,"" she said.

Joe Biden triumphed in the key state of Michigan, while also winning in Missouri, Mississippi and Idaho, as he built his delegate lead over Bernie Sanders with a coalition of African-Americans, suburbanites and older voters in Tuesday's round of Democratic presidential nominating contests.
Opening a new phase in the race, the former vice president put distance between himself and Mr. Sanders—and built upon his momentum from
wins in 10 Super Tuesday states
last week. Mr. Biden quickly sought to unite the party after prevailing in Michigan, which offered 125 delegates, the biggest prize of the night. Mr. Sanders won the North Dakota caucuses, while the results in Washington, the second-biggest delegate haul of the day, were too close to call.
""I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion,"" Mr. Biden said in remarks at Philadelphia's National Constitution Center. ""We share a common goal and, together, we'll defeat Donald Trump; we'll defeat him together.""
Mr. Biden has presented himself as the Democrat best able to challenge President Trump in general election battlegrounds such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, which was the first of those states to weigh in on the Democratic race. His win there, by one measure, is his most significant yet and could allow him to argue that he should be the party's nominee. With about 64% of precincts reporting, Mr. Biden had about 53% of the vote to about 38% for Mr. Sanders. The Vermont senator narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton in the state in the 2016 nominating contest.
Mr. Biden was projected the winner in Mississippi, Missouri and Michigan shortly after the states' polls closed, an early sign of his clout in three states with large African-American voting blocs. Black voters made up about two-thirds of the electorate in Mississippi, exit polls showed. Mr. Biden had won more than 80% of support in the state, with about 89% of precincts reporting.
The former vice president campaigned ahead of the Missouri primary among African-Americans in St. Louis and Kansas City. With about 93% of precincts reporting, Mr. Biden had about 60% of the vote in Missouri.
Mr. Sanders returned to his home in Burlington, Vt., and did not speak publicly after the election results. A campaign aide said he intended to participate in Sunday's debate in Phoenix.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a top Sanders surrogate, expressed disappointment as the election results streamed in. ""There's no sugar-coating it. Tonight's a tough night. Tonight's a tough night for the movement overall,"" Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said on Instagram.
Mr. Biden entered Tuesday with a delegate edge of 670 to 574 over Mr. Sanders, according to
a Wall Street Journal delegate tracker
, even as Super Tuesday states such as California and Colorado, which Mr. Sanders carried, continue to process election results.
Mr. Sanders sought to steady his campaign on Tuesday. Moderates in the Democratic Party rapidly
coalesced around Mr. Biden
after he won South Carolina's primary last month. Some in the party's establishment have expressed fears that Mr. Sanders, a self-described Democratic socialist who won the New Hampshire and Nevada contests, would be too liberal for many voters in the general election.
The campaigns competed for votes against the backdrop of
growing economic concerns
over
the spread of the coronavirus
. Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden both canceled rallies in Cleveland Tuesday, ahead of Ohio's primary next week, citing public health concerns. Both candidates have
questioned Mr. Trump's handling of the crisis
in recent days.
Exit polls coming in with the results showed Mr. Biden winning handily among black and older voters and performing well with those who had at least a college degree. Mr. Biden was also prevailing in cities such as St. Louis, Kansas City and Detroit and in their surrounding suburban areas—including Oakland County, Mich., a key general election battleground.
Mr. Sanders maintained a substantial advantage over Mr. Biden among young voters, exit polls showed. The Vermont senator staked much of his campaign on motivating the young, and others disenchanted with current politics, to come to the polls.
Mr. Biden, while campaigning in Michigan, spoke of the Obama administration's bailout of General Motors and Chrysler, two titans of the state's auto industry, more than a decade ago.
""We bet on you,"" Mr. Biden said during a visit to a Fiat Chrysler assembly plant in Detroit earlier Tuesday. ""If I end up being the president, you'll never have a better friend in the White House.""
During a Detroit rally on the eve of the primary, Mr. Biden was joined by California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, two former presidential rivals who recently endorsed Mr. Biden's candidacy. The pair—who have been discussed by some Democrats as potential running mates for Mr. Biden if he wins the nomination—sought to help him appeal to black voters in the state.
Mr. Sanders courted voters at a Dearborn Heights, Mich., polling place on Tuesday, repeating criticisms he has raised about Mr. Biden's record, including the former Delaware senator's past support for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Mr. Sanders told reporters that was ""obviously a very important state"" but that he thinks every state is important to try to win. Last week, his campaign dispatched top aides to Michigan, including some who oversaw his Iowa caucus efforts.
""When our record is compared to Biden's, when our vision is compared to Biden's, when we have that debate in Phoenix, I'm feeling pretty good,"" Mr. Sanders said, referring to Sunday's
primary debate in Arizona
.
Tuesday's nominating contest served as the first opportunity for voters to consider a one-on-one choice between Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii) was still seeking the nomination but has been unable to break out of single-digit polling.
Mr. Biden has largely sought to avoid confrontation with Mr. Sanders as he attempts to build support in the party.
The former vice president mostly has only mentioned his opponent to point out that he himself has driven up turnout in primaries so far, not Mr. Sanders. Mr. Biden has argued that he is bringing African-Americans and white blue-collar workers into his coalition.
""Sen. Sanders likes to say, 'We need a record turnout to beat Donald Trump.' He's absolutely right,"" Mr. Biden has told audiences in recent days, rattling off statistics from Super Tuesday showing a turnout boost in states such as Virginia, Texas and North Carolina.
""Guess who they voted for? They voted for us,"" Mr. Biden said.

Bernie Sanders made a case for continuing in the 2020 race, challenging his front-running rival, Joe Biden, to embrace a series of liberal causes, as the former vice president sought to unite the Democratic Party behind his presidential bid.
Mr. Sanders told reporters in Burlington, Vt., that Tuesday ""was not a good night for our campaign."" However, he said he still intended to debate the former vice president
Sunday in Phoenix
and press him on climate change, income inequality and more.
The Vermont senator touted the popularity of some of his ideas with Democrats but said his campaign often hears that voters see Mr. Biden as a better bet against President Trump in the November election.
""While our campaign has won the ideological debate, we are losing the debate over electability,"" Mr. Sanders said.
The frank assessment of his campaign came as Mr. Biden strengthened his pathway to the Democratic presidential nomination with his series of victories Tuesday.
Mr. Biden
won in the key battleground state of Michigan
and in Missouri, Mississippi and Idaho with a coalition of African-Americans, suburbanites and older voters. It was a further sign of Mr. Biden's surge in just a matter of weeks from a candidate who appeared headed for a third failed presidential bid to the delegate leader and front-runner. The wins also prompted calls from inside the party to unite around his candidacy and direct its full attention to Mr. Trump.
""Last night, Joe Biden expanded his coalition and continues to demonstrate he is the candidate who can unite the Democratic Party,"" T.J. Ducklo, a Biden campaign spokesman, said Wednesday. ""Our campaign is focused on the task at hand: defeating Donald Trump, so we can make real, lasting progressive change in this country and in people's lives.""
The former vice president's turnaround has reordered the contest for the Democratic nomination over the past few weeks and put pressure on Mr. Sanders to prove he has a viable path forward.
On Wednesday morning, Mr. Sanders was declared the winner of the North Dakota caucuses, while the two candidates were locked in a tight race in Washington state. With 67% of precincts reporting, each candidate had about a third of the vote in that state.
Tad Devine, the chief strategist of Mr. Sanders's 2016 campaign who most recently helped the presidential campaign of Andrew Yang, said in an interview he didn't see ""a realistic pathway to the nomination"" for Mr. Sanders.

""The question he has to confront this time, which was not on the play last time, is are you going to enable another four years of Donald Trump by participating in this process longer? And are you going to handicap Biden's ability to defeat Trump? That's a very big issue,"" said Mr. Devine, who noted he had not spoken to the senator since the last presidential bid.
Mr. Biden reached out to the Vermont senator's supporters Tuesday evening as he sought to position himself as a Democratic candidate the party could rally around.
""I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion,"" Mr. Biden said in Philadelphia. ""We share a common goal and together, we'll defeat Donald Trump. We'll defeat him together.""
Encouraged by Tuesday's results, Mr. Biden's allies began making plans for a monthslong battle against Mr. Trump. Unite the Country, a pro-Biden super PAC, said in a memo to supporters that ""the functional primary phase of this election is over.""
The group said it had raised nearly $10 million, ""with triple that in commitments,"" during the past 10 days.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How do you expect Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders to adjust their campaign strategies before their Sunday debate? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Biden's strong performance, after
winning 10 states just a week ago on Super Tuesday
, also spurred two deep-pocketed liberal groups to get behind him and say the general-election campaign against Mr. Trump was starting. Priorities USA and American Bridge had remained neutral throughout the primary.
""The math is now clear. Joe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee for President and @prioritiesUSA is going to do everything we can to help him defeat Donald Trump in November,"" tweeted Priorities USA Chairman Guy Cecil just minutes before the Associated Press declared Mr. Biden the winner in the Michigan primary.
American Bridge announced a $2.2 million ad buy in Pennsylvania as it declared it was ""all in"" for Mr. Biden.
With those groups lining up behind Mr. Biden, Sunday's debate took on more importance, as it will be the first time the two men will go head-to-head.
Rep. Tim Ryan (D., Ohio), a Biden supporter, said on CNN that he would welcome a debate of ideas this weekend but cautioned that Mr. Sanders shouldn't use the opportunity to tear down Mr. Biden.
""I think at this point, trashing each other is not in the best interest of, not just the Democratic Party, but bringing some unity to this country,"" he said.
But Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said Wednesday on CNN that the campaign wouldn't tell Mr. Sanders what to do. Instead, she made an appeal to his supporters and young voters.
""I think there is a tremendous amount that we agree on, and I would say to Bernie Sanders supporters that if they're looking for a home, they've got one with Joe Biden,"" Ms. Bedingfield said.
Mr. Biden has presented himself as the Democrat best able to challenge Mr. Trump in general-election battlegrounds such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, which was the first of those states to weigh in on the Democratic race. With 99% of precincts reporting, Mr. Biden had about 53% of the vote to about 37% for Mr. Sanders. Mr. Sanders narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton in the state in the 2016 nominating contest.
Mr. Biden was projected the winner in Mississippi, Missouri and Michigan shortly after the states' polls closed, an early sign of his clout in three states with large African-American voting blocs. Black voters made up about two-thirds of the electorate in Mississippi, exit polls showed. Mr. Biden had won more than 80% of support in the state, with about 98% of precincts reporting.
The former vice president campaigned ahead of the Missouri primary among African-Americans in St. Louis and Kansas City. With about 100% of precincts reporting, Mr. Biden had about 60% of the vote in Missouri.
Mr. Biden's delegate edge early Wednesday was 843 to 681 over Mr. Sanders, according to a Wall Street Journal delegate tracker, even as Super Tuesday states such as California and Colorado, which Mr. Sanders carried, continue to process election results.
The campaigns have competed for votes against the backdrop of growing economic concerns over the
spread of the coronavirus
. Both candidates have questioned Mr. Trump's handling of the crisis in recent days, and on Tuesday they each canceled rallies in Cleveland, ahead of Ohio's primary next week, citing public-health concerns.
In response to the threat of the virus, the Democratic National Committee also decided to
forgo an audience at Sunday's debate.

Mr. Biden's campaign announced Wednesday it had formed a health advisory committee of medical and national security experts to advise it on the steps it should take ""to minimize health risks for the candidate, staff and supporters."" Based on conversations with the committee and elected officials in Illinois and Florida, the campaign said it decided not to hold large gatherings in those states ahead of next week's primaries. Instead, the campaign will hold virtual events.
Mr. Biden is also expected to address the response to the novel coronavirus during remarks in Wilmington, Del., on Thursday.
Exit polls coming in with the results showed Mr. Biden winning handily among black and older voters and performing well with those who had at least a college degree. Mr. Biden was also prevailing in cities such as St. Louis, Kansas City and Detroit and in their surrounding areas—including Oakland County, Mich., a general-election battleground.
Mr. Sanders maintained a substantial advantage over Mr. Biden among young voters, exit polls showed. The Vermont senator staked much of his campaign on motivating the young as well as others disenchanted with current politics to come to the polls.

Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez called for a recanvass of results of the party's Iowa caucuses on Thursday while the Associated Press said it was unable to declare a winner, two blows to a state at risk of losing its status as the host of the first presidential nominating contest every four years.
Mr. Perez's public call for an audit of the paper trail from each of more than 1,700 precincts drew renewed attention to the technical glitches and other problems that have delayed the declaration of a winner of Monday's caucuses. Those irregularities, which also factored into the AP's decision, cast doubt on the final tallies released by the state party late Thursday.
The party's count showed Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., with a razor-thin edge over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the share of delegates. But Mr. Sanders was ahead in the popular vote.
Shortly after full results were reported by the state party, Mr. Sanders's campaign issued a statement that questioned the validity of the results, while also claiming victory.
""We also feel confident that the discrepancies we're providing tonight, in addition to those widely identified in the national media, mean that the [state delegate equivalents] count will never be known with any kind of certainty,"" said Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser. ""Given the rules changes we fought for that required the release of the popular vote count, SDEs are now an antiquated and meaningless metric for deciding the winner.""
Buttigieg campaign spokesman Chris Meagher declined to comment on Mr. Weaver's statement.
Earlier Thursday, Mr. Perez took to Twitter to criticize the process in Iowa.
""Enough is enough,"" he wrote. ""In light of the problems that have emerged in the implementation of the delegate selection plan and in order to assure public confidence in the results, I am calling on the Iowa Democratic Party to immediately begin a recanvass.""
In a statement later, Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price didn't directly address Mr. Perez's comments but said the party was prepared to conduct a recanvass -- which he said would entail auditing the paper records from each precinct caucus -- if requested by a campaign, per party rules. None has publicly done so.
The state party's website late Thursday showed results had been reported for all 1,765 precincts. Mr. Buttigieg's total for state delegate equivalents, the state and national parties' preferred metric, was 564, while Mr. Sanders had 562. The two leading candidates were separated by less than a 10th of a percentage point, so even slight counting errors could affect the outcome.
Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders were followed by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.
The AP's election calls are widely held up as a standard in the news media, and the organization's inability to declare a winner is a further blemish on the Iowa caucuses.
""Because of a tight margin between former Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders and the irregularities in this year's caucus process, it is not possible to determine a winner at this point,"" said AP executive editor Sally Buzbee.
Democratic Party officials in Iowa have attributed the tabulation problems to a software glitch that triggered inconsistencies in data obtained from a mobile app used to report vote tallies. Paper records were then manually reviewed, the state party has said.
Some Democrats outside of Iowa have argued the state's early status is no longer warranted, given this year's botched reporting.

The winner of the most Democratic presidential votes so far often rejects the label of Democrat. The Republican president, who is seeking re-election, belonged to the GOP for only about half of the 20 years before he won the White House.
Self-described democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders and President Trump rose in politics by developing strong personal brands, while keeping only tenuous ties to—and frequently criticizing the leaders of—the parties they later sought to lead.
Their ascents are the latest sign that the nation's political parties have lost influence in choosing their own presidential nominees, a development that some party officials see as inevitable in the modern media environment and an era of billionaires funding their own campaigns, as Mr. Trump initially did and Democrat Michael Bloomberg is doing today. But it is one that they say has made politics more volatile and partisan.
""We're organized around individual candidates and individual concerns. No one wants to be bothered with the party,"" said Tom Rath, a former Republican National Committee member and veteran of New Hampshire presidential primaries.
""The parties are powerless right now and have been for a while,"" said Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist. ""With both parties,"" he said of the nominating process, ""it's personality- and candidate-driven, not party-driven.""
Now, as
Democrats cast their first primary votes
and start to winnow their candidate field, some in the party say that party officials have surrendered too much influence to a primary system that empowers activists and candidates. None are arguing that the party should return to the days when party insiders alone picked presidential nominees. But some believe the corps of state and national committee leaders, who are focused on protecting the party's long-term interests, should have retained more of a role in the nominating process.
Several current and former members of the Democratic National Committee said a party that once elevated Govs. Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton to the White House should have found a way to place governors, who have proven electoral records, on
the debate stage
more often. They noted that Marianne Williamson, an author and self-described spiritual leader, qualified for the first debate while Steve Bullock, who won the governor's office as a Democrat in conservative Montana, didn't.
DNC Chairman Tom Perez should have acted ""by decree"" to give more visibility to elected leaders such as Mr. Bullock or former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, said Elaine Kamarck, a longtime DNC member. At the same time, she said, Mr. Perez had little choice but to adopt neutral qualifying criteria, because ""party leaders are no longer expected to have a role in choosing the nominee.""
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What do you think of the state of political parties and their significance in the presidential election? Join the conversation below.
Some current and former DNC members also say they surrendered too much power when
they agreed in 2018 to strip insiders known as superdelegates
of the right to help pick the presidential nominee at the national convention on the first ballot. Now, only delegates elected by voters at primaries and caucuses can vote on the initial ballot,
the result of a deal with Mr. Sanders
motivated by concerns that the party machinery was working against his candidacy in 2016. The superdelegates—lawmakers, governors, former presidents and other party insiders—will vote only if there is no winner on the first ballot.
""Democratic governors and senators and state chairs who do politics day in and day out know as much about the Democratic Party, the strongest candidate, the history of the party, the ideology of the party, as an activist,"" said Alice Germond, a former longtime DNC member. ""We need both.""
Xochitl Hinojosa, a spokeswoman for the DNC, said the superdelegate rule emerged from a long review with wide support. ""We wanted to make sure that our nominating process reflects the will of the people,"" she said. Addressing the debate criteria, she said the party arranged for television time for 20 candidates in the early debates and set a low bar for eligibility.
Mr. Trump's election in 2016 validates the primary process, his supporters say. As a candidate, Mr. Trump initially had little institutional backing within the party. But his success in the primaries showed that he understood what Republican voters wanted better than did GOP leaders, which included a combative approach to immigration, trade deals and protecting certain entitlements.
One reason parties have less influence in the nominations is that social media and cable TV have given candidates more ability to raise money, build mailing lists and excite voters—functions that parties traditionally handle. Mr. Rath doesn't see the party reclaiming that central role. ""It's like saying we'll go back to the rotary dial phone…or we're only going to watch Walter Cronkite. It's not going to happen.""
In 2004, Democratic nominee John Kerry spent about $77 for every $100 the DNC spent on the presidential campaign. Four years later, with online fundraising and social media more developed as political tools, Barack Obama spent almost $300 for every $100 spent by the DNC. GOP spending shows a similar but more muted trend.
Another challenge to the parties is the rise of self-funding candidates.
Mr. Bloomberg has so far spent more than $370 million
on campaign ads alone, according to tracking firm Kantar/CMAG. His status as a former Republican and independent—he won the New York mayor's office with one affiliation, then the other, and had been a Democrat before that—is another sign of independence from his current political party.
Lamenting the loss of party power might seem unusual at a time that party unity is unusually high. Mr. Trump's job approval among Republicans tops 90%. In Congress, lawmakers rarely break from their party on key votes.
Some party officials and academics say that the partisanship is due, in part, to the lack of party control over candidate nominations, at the congressional level as well as for president. Where candidates often press on a few issues that help them in the short term, ""a party can put together a platform to say what the tradeoffs are across all the policy domains,'' said Frances McCall Rosenbluth, a professor of political science at Yale University.
Charlie Black, a longtime Republican strategist, saw no tie between the GOP nominating process and increased polarization. In fact, sometimes they've nominated the most moderate person,'' he said, citing the candidate fields that produced nominees Bob Dole in 1996, John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012, among others.
""What are you going to do, anyhow?'' he asked. ""When we used to have conventions and caucuses, people used to scream about smoke-filled rooms. It's anti-democratic to say we don't want people to vote in a primary.''

Montana's two-term Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock said he would challenge incumbent Republican Sen. Steve Daines, putting the GOP on defense in another state as it fights to keep control of the Senate in November.
Democrats had heavily recruited Mr. Bullock, who has won three times statewide in Montana, once as attorney general and twice as governor. He won his second term as governor in 2016 by about 4 percentage points—when President Trump won the traditionally red state by about 20 points.
Mr. Bullock had repeatedly denied any interest in running for Senate before and after
his failed presidential campaign
, which ended in December. Since then, he met with former President Obama last month, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer traveled to Montana to make a last-minute appeal to Mr. Bullock to run.
Mr. Bullock's announcement came just under the wire, coinciding with the filing deadline in Montana and propelling a previously sleepy Senate race into the national spotlight.
""I've always fought for the people of Montana. Together, we expanded health care, protected public lands, banned dark money in politics & more. Now I'm taking that fight to the US Senate. Let's make Washington work more like Montana,"" Mr. Bullock wrote on Twitter Monday morning.
Republicans now hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate. But this is an unfavorable election cycle for the party, which is defending 23 Republican-held seats in 2020. Democrats are defending just 12 seats, nine of them in states President Trump lost in 2016.
Democrats must gain three seats to take control of the Senate if they win the White House. If Mr. Trump is re-elected, Democrats would need to net four seats.
""Bullock getting into the race is a legitimate game-changer,"" said Nathan Gonzales, editor and publisher of Inside Elections, which provides nonpartisan analysis of campaigns. ""It brings a seat that was previously solid for Republicans onto the battlefield of competitive races. It decreases the percentage of competitive seats that Democrats need to win in order to gain control.""
With Mr. Bullock's entry, Inside Elections likely will move its rating of the race from solid Republican to lean Republican, Mr. Gonzales said.
Democratic Sen. Jon Tester narrowly won re-election for the other Senate seat in Montana in 2018. Mr. Daines, a businessman who served in the House from 2013 to 2015, is seeking his second term in the Senate. He was elected in an open race in 2014. He has stockpiled more than $5 million in campaign cash in preparation for the possibility that Mr. Bullock might take him on.
Other Competitive Senate Races
The Montana Senate race will be one of the competitive contests this election cycle. Others include:
North Carolina, where Democrat Cal Cunningham, a former state lawmaker and Army veteran, is challenging incumbent Republican Sen. Thom Tillis;
Colorado, where former Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper is hoping to oust GOP Sen. Cory Gardner, who is hoping for a second term;
Arizona, where former astronaut Mark Kelly has outraised Republican Sen. Martha McSally, a former combat pilot appointed in 2018 to fill Sen. John McCain's seat after he died;
Maine, where polls show Republican Sen. Susan Collins in a close race with her likely rival, Democrat Sara Gideon, speaker of the Maine House of Representatives.
""We're going to win this race because Steve Daines is always on Montana's side fighting for more high-paying jobs, against big government and defending Montanans' way of life,"" said Shane Scanlon, campaign manager for Mr. Daines.
""I'm still feeling confident,"" said Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOP's campaign arm. ""Steve Daines is a great fit for the state. He's helped to sustain the longest period of economic prosperity and economic growth in American history, and he's fighting hard for the people of the state."" Mr. Young said Mr. Bullock's entry wouldn't change the Republican campaign committee's strategy. ""We're good,"" he said.
But Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who headed the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee last cycle, said Mr. Bullock's decision to run in Montana would expand the map for his party, making Montana a top-tier race alongside tough contests in Colorado, Arizona, North Carolina and Maine. ""He is immediately a credible, strong candidate for United State Senate and he clearly puts that state in play,"" Mr. Van Hollen said.
Long seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party, Mr. Bullock was sought-after as a Senate recruit, but he said he wasn't interested. Instead he
launched a presidential bid in May
, touting his ability to work with Republicans to expand Medicaid coverage in his state.
He raised and spent about $5.4 million, framing himself as a moderate who could win in states friendly to Mr. Trump. But in a crowded field, his campaign never took off. He only made one debate and dropped out in December, before the Iowa caucuses.
Mr. Bullock's announcement to run for the Senate comes less than a week after an unexpectedly strong Super Tuesday performance revived former Vice President Joe Biden's 's hopes of securing the Democratic presidential nomination.
Mr. Gonzales said there is little doubt that Mr. Bullock's prospects would be better with Mr. Biden as the party's nominee, rather than Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist.
""It's hard to believe that a top-tier candidate in a red state would put their life on hold to run with Bernie Sanders at the top of the ticket,"" he said.

Betting markets show Hillary Clinton is one of the top contenders in the race for the Democratic nominee.
She isn't running for president.
Prediction markets have become a popular, though not necessarily reliable, way for people to bet on political results. While notoriously volatile and often proven wrong, betting markets are drawing extra scrutiny ahead of this week's Super Tuesday contests.
Consider PredictIt, an online market run by New Zealand's Victoria University of Wellington. Offering a range of election and other political bets, PredictIt currently shows a bettor can pay 7 cents to win $1 if Mrs. Clinton wins the Democratic nomination. Those are the fourth-best odds of any nominee, better than those of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren or former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
Perhaps the prediction markets know something others don't, but Mrs. Clinton isn't a candidate. (A PredictIt spokesman said Mrs. Clinton's odds were likely a reflection of ""trader long-shot bias"" and the possibility of a brokered convention, among other factors.)
Other metrics also show extremes that don't mesh with what more traditional political polls show. Bettors at one point on PredictIt last month gave former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg a 33% chance of winning the nomination.
Those odds—which placed him in second place at the time and came on some of the heaviest volume PredictIt has logged over the past 90 days—were also far higher than the probabilities he garnered in other political polls.
The 2020 presidential election campaign has largely been a secondary factor driving recent financial-market performance. Stocks are coming off their
worst week since the financial crisis
on fears of how the spreading coronavirus, or Covid-19, could crimp the global economy and corporate profits.
Yet some investors also are trying to decipher what the Super Tuesday outcomes could mean for markets, particularly as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders appears to be moving closer to securing the nomination.
Chris Senyek, chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research, said the markets' recent swoon was driven by ""rising Covid-19 fears, and, to a lesser extent, Bernie Sanders' strong momentum.""
Mixing politics and portfolios has historically had a mixed record. The conventional wisdom heading into the 2016 presidential election was a Donald Trump victory would prompt stocks to go down. Betting markets played down then-candidate Trump's chances. Of course, the opposite played out.
Goldman Sachs analysts said prediction markets suggest a divided federal government is the most probable election outcome, one that could lead to additional uncertainty if corporate tax reform implemented under President Trump is reversed. Under that scenario, Goldman said, ""the impact on S&P 500 profits would be significant.""
The firm is no longer expecting U.S. companies to post any earnings growth in 2020. It expects exporters will register falling demand and companies will suffer from supply-chain disruptions as a result of the spreading coronavirus outbreak, which could pose widespread disruptions on people's everyday lives and business activity and imperil the U.S. economy's longest expansion on record.
""An economic slowdown caused by this virus certainly increases Bernie's chances,"" said Dave Lutz, managing director and head of ETF trading at JonesTrading.
The thinking is a struggling economy, or even a recession, could hurt Mr. Trump's odds at being re-elected, paving the way for whoever becomes the Democratic nominee. PredictIt shows Mr. Sanders has a greater-than-50% chance of securing the nomination, but only a 31% chance of beating President Trump in the election.
One indicator Goldman Sachs analysts are watching is second-quarter gross domestic product growth. Historically, this has been one of the most important metrics to watch in gauging a sitting U.S. president's re-election probability.
""If Covid-19 becomes widespread and leads to a slowdown in U.S. growth or a recession, it could alter current expected election outcomes,"" Goldman said.

The
impending impeachment trial
, the U.S. troop presence in the Middle East and whether a woman can win the White House were among the topics six Democratic presidential contenders
addressed during the last debate
before voters start selecting a nominee to face the president in November.
""Look at the men on this stage. Collectively, they have lost 10 elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they've been in are the women: Amy and me.""—Sen. Elizabeth Warren
Tension has been brewing between Sens. Warren and Sanders, who share much of the Democratic liberal base.

Ms. Warren said earlier this week
that Mr. Sanders told her during a private 2018 meeting that a woman couldn't win the presidency. Mr. Sanders has repeatedly denied that, including during the debate. Though Ms. Warren called Mr. Sanders ""a friend"" when asked about the event, she pointed out the records of the two women Democratic contenders compared with the four male candidates. After the debate ended Ms. Warren refused Mr. Sanders' handshake, leading to a terse exchange between the two on stage, though it was unclear what was said.
Why this matters: The recent disputes have further divided the two campaigns, but the candidates kept it mostly friendly during the debate. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have since pointed out that any infighting could ultimately help Mr. Trump. Still, there are concerns that if Mr. Sanders's campaign is too divisive, his supporters may not rally around any other potential nominee—and that could lead to a repeat of what happened in the 2016 election with Hillary Clinton.
""The American people are sick and tired of endless wars which have cost us trillions of dollars.""—Sen. Bernie Sanders
President Trump's decision to authorize an airstrike that
resulted in the death
of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani has reignited a debate over America's military footprint in the Middle East.
The candidates were near unanimous in arguing for a diminished U.S. military presence in the region. But they differed sharply on a timeline for withdrawing troops, with Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders suggesting the U.S. should pull out of the Middle East entirely.
""We should stop asking our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily,"" Ms. Warren said.
Former Vice President Joe Biden and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar disagreed, suggesting it was impossible to remove all troops from the Middle East. Former South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a veteran of the Afghanistan war, said he favored taking a more limited approach and called for further military action to be authorized by Congress.
Why this matters: Foreign policy has largely taken a back seat in the Democratic primary in favor of domestic priorities such as health care and the economy. But Mr. Trump's recent actions in Iran have forced Democrats to contend with circumstances under which the U.S. could be fighting another ground war.
Mr. Biden's opponents have zeroed in on his vote in favor of the Iraq war, which the former vice president now acknowledges was ""a mistake."" Mr. Sanders, who opposed the war, said it was ""the worst foreign policy blunder in modern American history."" So far, Mr. Biden's Iraq war vote hasn't proved as much a liability as it was for Hillary Clinton in 2008.
""I don't know that there's any trade agreement that [Mr. Sanders] would ever think it made any sense.""—Former Vice President Joe Biden
Mr. Trump is poised to sign a
preliminary trade deal with China
on Wednesday, paving the way for a temporary detente in the continuing trade war between the world's two largest economies. The Senate also is gearing up for a vote to ratify the revamped North American trade deal, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement,
which was passed by the House of Representatives last month
. All of the Democratic candidates onstage—with the exception of Mr. Sanders and billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer—said they supported the USMCA despite their broader reservations over Mr. Trump's handling of trade policy.
Why this matters: Democrats have grown increasingly critical of international trade agreements amid pressure from labor unions and environmental groups. But ongoing divisions within the party over how to revamp existing trade deals were laid bare on Tuesday, as candidates sparred over the impact on American workers.
Ms. Warren, in a split with her liberal rival Mr. Sanders, backed the USMCA as ""a modest improvement"" that will provide temporary relief to farmers she said were hurting as a result of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Citing environmental concerns, Mr. Sanders maintained his opposition to the deal, stating: ""The answer is we can do much better than a Trump-led trade deal.""
Mr. Biden vowed there would be no trade agreements signed in his administration ""without environmentalists and labor at the table,"" but warned against isolating the U.S. economy by refusing to forge trade partnerships with international allies. Mr. Buttigieg said much of the ""fear and frustration"" over U.S. trade policy stemmed from a sentiment among American workers, in regions such as the industrial Midwest, that they had been left behind by previous trade deals.
The issue of trade is especially salient in Iowa, the first state in the Democratic nominating contest, where the agricultural industry has been disrupted by Mr. Trump's trade war with China.
""We've asked for only four people as witnesses. And if our Republican colleagues won't allow those witnesses, they may as well give the president a crown and a scepter; they may as well make him king.""—Sen. Amy Klobuchar
The Democratic-led House
last month voted to impeach
Mr. Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, for just the third time in the nation's history.
Mr. Trump, who has denied any wrongdoing, has urged the Senate to dismiss the articles of impeachment without a trial. But moderate Republicans have been pushing hard behind the scenes to allow a vote on witnesses and documents.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has been coordinating with the White House on impeachment strategy, has said he has enough Republican support to move forward on the proceedings without bipartisan agreement on the trial's structure. Under his plan, senators would wait to determine whether to include witnesses until after the trial begins, which he
expects will be next Tuesday.

Republican senators briefed on draft rules for the trial have said they would likely guarantee a vote on witnesses and documents after opening arguments and a period for written questions.
Why this matters: Democrats have demanded the ability to call witnesses and subpoena documents to gather more information than what came out during the House investigation.
Meanwhile, after a weekslong wait the House plans to vote Wednesday to name the Democrats who will argue the case for Mr. Trump's removal. The chamber will then send the articles over to the Senate.
Sens. Sanders, Warren and Klobuchar have said they would fulfill their senatorial duties and participate in any trial. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, who didn't qualify for Tuesday's debate, would also be affected. The senators have said they would use surrogates on the campaign trail.
""This debate isn't real.""—Sen. Amy Klobuchar
The Democratic presidential candidates again sparred over health care reform.
Ms. Klobuchar said many members of Congress and Democratic governors don't support Medicare for All and a public option should be pursued in addition to coverage for mental health, disabilities and long-term care insurance.
Health care was expected to come up in the debate after Mr. Trump this week tweeted that he had saved pre-existing conditions. The Trump administration has backed a lawsuit that would invalidate the Affordable Care Act, which bars insurers from denying people health coverage because of past and current medical issues.
The administration is also arguing against having the Supreme Court fast-track consideration of the lawsuit, so the court may not decide until after the 2020 presidential election.
Why this matters: Polls show voters are more eager to hear concrete ideas about lowering health costs, particularly for prescription drugs, even though the debate again focused heavily on Medicare for All compared to the public option.
Candidates sparred over the costs of their proposals, with Mr. Sanders saying the average family would ultimately benefit from Medicare for All whereas Mr. Biden called for reinstating Obamacare with the addition of a public option.
Ms. Klobuchar's point, echoing that of many moderate critics, was that the debate over Medicare for All was largely irrelevant because it is so unlikely to ever pass through Congress.

As the country barrels toward Super Tuesday, there are many ways to make money from the 2020 presidential election. If you think Sen. Bernie Sanders is going to win, you could short luxury-goods manufacturers. Or if you're betting on Sen. Elizabeth Warren's chances, you could plan to buy shares of Ancestry.com in the event that the DNA testing company's long-rumored IPO finally takes place.
But if you want to take a position directly on the presidential election outcome using an online market, you can't bet more than $850 on any single prediction. That's because the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has set strict limits on trading. It has further kneecapped online political betting by allowing it only for ""research purposes."" Existing platforms like PredictIt and Iowa Electronic Markets are run out of universities and cannot profit from the markets they create.
Political betting is a useful source of information for journalists and voters who track campaigns. And unlike pundits, election speculators have skin in the game. It's time for the CFTC to relax its suffocating regulations on prediction markets.
Political betting has a storied history in the U.S. In October and November of presidential election years from 1896 to 1924, the prices for such bets were
regularly quoted
in major New York newspapers. Trading of election-related bets on the New York Curb Exchange—predecessor of the American Stock Exchange—occasionally exceeded the volume of stock and bond trading.
Political markets serve valuable purposes: They help people imagine alternative futures and make it possible to hedge political risks in a more-direct way than proxy bets allow. Coal companies could go long on Bloomberg futures to mitigate some of the losses they anticipate from his energy policies. Companies that would rely on government subsidies under a Green New Deal could do the same with Trump contracts.
The CFTC disputes this,
holding that
""the unpredictability of the specific economic consequences of an election means that the Political Event Contracts cannot reasonably be expected to be used for hedging purposes."" This is like saying that because the efficient-markets hypothesis is true—it's impossible to beat the market—stock trading shouldn't be allowed. It's a paternalistic view that prevents Americans from reaping the benefits of financial innovation.
If unleashed, such markets could also provide useful information for policy makers. George Mason University economist Robin Hanson has
suggested
using prediction markets to test hypotheses about how a given political event, such as the adoption of a single-payer health system, would affect some other variable, like gross domestic product or life expectancy. Two markets would be created, one in which investors would predict U.S. real GDP in five years if single payer were passed and one without the change. The differential between the two might help policy makers make wiser decisions.
Prediction markets aren't limited to legislation and elections. Researchers at Tel Aviv University and New York University's Stern School of Business
have found
that the prices of contracts that paid out on the precise timing of Saddam Hussein's expulsion from power were correlated with stock and oil prices during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003.
Advances in blockchain and smart-contract technology further militate for rethinking regulations on political betting. These innovations have created alternatives to third-party brokers like PredictIt, which takes 10% of profits and 5% of withdrawals. The CFTC's current limits on competition among brokers have kept transaction costs high and reduced efficiency.
To be sure, not all contracts should be allowed. A bet on whether a certain politician will be assassinated could easily create dangerous incentives, and the CFTC rightly
deems
such event contracts contrary to the public interest. (Although Congress could determine whether some killings—such as of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani—are in the public interest, and could conceivably issue such contracts under the constitutional power to grant letters of marque and reprisal.)
But the CFTC's draconian restrictions on general political betting are not justified by its
concern
that citizens would have perverse incentives to vote for their bets instead of their honest political preferences. Mr. Hanson's research finds that alleged market manipulators, like
the so-called Romney Whale,
who wagered $4 million on the 2012 Republican presidential nominee with an Irish brokerage, actually
make markets more accurate
on average by ""boosting the returns to informed trading.""
The U.K.
already allows such markets
, and no one asserts that they played a decisive role in the elections of Margaret Thatcher or Tony Blair, just as no one questions the electoral legitimacy of William McKinley or Warren G. Harding—both of whom were elected when the federal government still allowed freewheeling prediction markets.
The CFTC should let you make money off our next president, whether it's Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton—whose odds of securing the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination are
currently priced at 6 cents to the dollar
.

The first primary elections since
the coronavirus pandemic
engulfed the nation were winding down Tuesday in Florida and Illinois and continuing in Arizona as candidates, voters and election officials tried to navigate a new and challenging environment.

Polls indicated former Vice President Joe Biden was poised to dominate
the day's voting
, potentially adding significantly to his delegate advantage over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in a Democratic presidential nomination race that appeared to be winding down.

Ohio 

pushed back a primary
scheduled for Tuesday because of concerns about the virus, joining a growing list of states that have delayed their contests until May or June in hopes the situation will improve.

On the eve of the balloting, an Ohio court rejected a request to postpone the state's primary until June 2 as Republican Gov. Mike DeWine had recommended. The in-person voting was subsequently placed on hold after the state's top health official ordered polls closed.

The Ohio Supreme Court denied a last-minute legal challenge to the postponement, and county election boards were deluged with phone calls from confused, frustrated voters.

In a statement released late Tuesday, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez called for states with upcoming primaries and caucuses to use vote by mail and other alternatives to casting ballots in person.

""What happened in Ohio last night has only bred more chaos and confusion,"" he said. ""States that have not yet held primary elections should focus on implementing the aforementioned measures to make it easier and safer for voters to exercise their constitutional right to vote, instead of moving primaries to later in the cycle when timing around the virus remains unpredictable.""

If the former vice president performs well, he could have a majority of the delegates awarded so far and more than half of the 1,991 needed to win the nomination.

A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Sunday showed
Mr. Biden was favored nationally, 61% to 32%
, among those who have already voted in the Democratic primary or plan to do so.

Mr. Biden has already begun trying to unify the party behind him, endorsing policy proposals related to bankruptcy laws and college tuition
in a bid to woo liberals
. Mr. Sanders acknowledged last week that he was losing the ""debate over electability"" among Democratic voters. He could face more pressure to get out of the race if Mr. Biden has a strong showing Tuesday so that the party can focus on competing against President Trump in November.

Florida and Arizona are battleground states, so they may offer some insights into possible general-election trends. This round of contests might be the last significant ones for some time, if more states announce primary postponements.

States that move their contests later than June 9 will need a waiver from the party to avoid losing delegates to the July convention, the DNC wrote in a memo this week.

Voters, sobered by the crisis, also cast ballots in local and state contests as they confronted school closures, travel limitations, event cancellations and a stressed global economy. Germs were also on their minds.

At a polling location inside a Miami fire station, workers wore gloves as they inspected voter identification cards and dispensed hand sanitizer to the visitors. Some voters arrived with their own pens, gloves and disinfecting wipes.

Officials in Chicago, the biggest city within the three states that voted Tuesday, said election-day turnout was running extremely low as nervous voters stayed home. Still, many had cast ballots early. Officials said the previous primary record for such voting was easily surpassed and vote-by-mail applications more than tripled compared with 2016.

James Allen, a Chicago Board of Election Commissioners spokesman, told reporters Tuesday that city election officials failed last week to convince Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker to cancel in-person voting and replace it with vote-by-mail balloting.

That triggered a critical response from Mr. Pritzker's office. Spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh said in a statement that the governor's office had offered ""to provide the National Guard to help staff the election"" as well as assistance in recruiting volunteers to fill in for election workers anxious about staffing polling places.

""The governor cannot unilaterally cancel or delay an election,"" she said. ""Elections are the cornerstone of our democracy and we could not risk confusion and disenfranchisement in the courts. No one is saying this is a perfect solution. We have no perfect solutions at the moment. We only have the least bad solutions.""

Some Chicago polls opened late because workers didn't show up or equipment wasn't delivered on time, while some voters were confused about where they were supposed to vote after about 200 of the city's 2,069 precinct voting locations had to be moved.

Voting-rights advocates said they fielded questions from confused voters and poll workers in multiple states because of changes made to polling locations to avoid nursing homes and other vulnerable sites.

""It's unprecedented for us to be addressing this much confusion around basic questions that voters have during a primary election, like where is my polling place,"" Ami Gandhi, senior counsel at the Chicago Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, told reporters.

She said there has been a lack of guidance for people who are homebound as a result of coronavirus concerns. ""Those who live in nursing homes or other similar facilities who no longer have the option of voting in their residence are really in a tough situation,"" Ms. Gandhi said.

More than half of state primaries and caucuses have been held, and turnout was trending higher before the outbreak pushed people back into their homes to try to slow the spread of the virus.

""I would guess that the election-day component of the turnout may be down,"" said David Hopkins, a political-science professor at Boston College.

Voting, like virtually every aspect of the presidential race, has been transformed by the outbreak.

The large rallies that for a year fueled Mr. Sanders's campaign have been replaced by online appearances transmitted into the homes of cloistered supporters. Mr. Biden is restructuring his fundraising operation, which had previously leveraged in-person events. Uncertainty remains about how campaigning will be affected for the general election.

Mike Casca, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said in an emailed statement Tuesday that the campaign wasn't conducting its usual get-out-the-vote efforts.

""We are making clear to voters that we believe going to the polls amid the coronavirus outbreak is a personal decision and we respect whichever choice they make,"" he said. ""We are also passing along guidance from the CDC on staying safe during the crisis.""

Unlike previous events held on the eve of primaries, Mr. Sanders during a virtual rally Monday evening didn't ask his supporters to vote for him. Mr. Biden tweeted Tuesday that people should ""vote by mail or curbside vote if you can. If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don't touch your face, and stay 6' from others in line.""

The crisis and postponement of state contests later in March and early April makes it especially hard for Mr. Sanders to gain ground on Mr. Biden, Mr. Hopkins said.

""The race has sort of been frozen in place,"" he said. ""If he wants to stay in the race, there isn't going to be much of a race for a while.""

Bernie Sanders's supporters want him to stay in the presidential contest, despite an unlikely path to the Democratic nomination after a string of primary losses in March.
The Vermont senator would have to completely upend the race by capturing more than 60% of the remaining delegates to overtake former Vice President Joe Biden and earn the party's nomination to face President Trump in the November election. Mr. Biden's allies have called for unity, but Mr.
Sanders has shown no sign
of leaving the race and has deflected questions about how long he will continue competing against him.
In interviews with more than two dozen Sanders supporters, many of them acknowledged his second bid for the Democratic nomination was unlikely to be successful. But nearly all said they saw no reason for him to exit now, and most of those in states with primaries still to come said they planned to vote for the senator.
Backers said
the coronavirus pandemic
that has shut down much of the U.S. highlights the need for many of Mr. Sanders's signature issues, such as a Medicare for All health insurance program. They hope that his continued presence in the race will pressure the Democratic Party and Mr. Biden to adopt more of Mr. Sanders policies.
""I think he should not give up, even if it looks like he's not going to be the nominee. He needs to continue to advocate for what we believe in,"" said Luis Yofe, 67, who works in the travel industry and lives in Dallas. ""For us to be enthusiastic, Biden and the party will have to adopt, in the platform for the general election, some of the key principles that Bernie is advocating.""
Mr.
Biden has adopted
some policies in a nod to liberals, including an expanded free-college program. Mr. Sanders has said the proposal doesn't go far enough.
""I'm happy to talk with him, and I've indicated that I also hear his supporters,"" Mr. Biden said on ABC's ""The View"" this week. ""He's had very strong support from young people, and I hear them.""
Democratic Party officials are set to meet in mid-July to decide on their platform and nominate the candidate who will take on Mr. Trump in the general election. To win the nomination on the first ballot at the convention, a candidate must earn 1,991 delegates, a majority of those awarded through state caucuses and primaries. As of Thursday afternoon, Mr. Biden had roughly 300 more delegates than Mr. Sanders.
But since the
coronavirus crisis prompted some states
to delay their contests, Mr. Biden is unlikely to
sew up the nomination quickly
if Mr. Sanders remains in the race.
In an interview with NPR Friday, Mr. Sanders said it would be ""a very steep road"" to overtake Mr. Biden.
The uncertainty caused by Covid-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus, has given some hope to a handful of Mr. Sanders's supporters that he still has a shot at the nomination. They say that the crisis has highlighted the need for a Medicare for All system because
millions of people who lose their jobs
because of the illness could also lose their health insurance.
""I think that the Covid stuff is maybe the absolute best possible thing for his campaign right now,"" said Kirsten Southwell, 29, a senior designer at the Art Institute of Chicago. ""I think it really confirms a lot of the things that Bernie has talked about.""
Ms. Southwell and others are hoping that voters will see Mr. Sanders's reaction to the crisis and go for him in droves, giving him the significant margins he would need in every state going forward.
""More far-fetched or seemingly impossible scenarios have happened,"" said college student Brooke Britt, 21, who lives in Bristol, R.I., and plans to vote for Mr. Sanders in her state's primary, which has been
postponed to June
.
Mr. Sanders returned to Vermont on Thursday after voting the night before on a roughly $2 trillion stimulus package aimed at bolstering the U.S. economy as it struggles with the spread of the coronavirus. Aides say the campaign's focus is on the day-to-day operation and responding to the pandemic rather than what Mr. Sanders's future holds.
The campaign hasn't put up a TV ad in more than a week and has stopped soliciting donations via email to fund its operation, instead pulling in money to support organizations that are involved in coronavirus relief. However, the campaign is still accepting donations on its website and recurring funds are still being pulled in. The Vermont senator is doing frequent virtual briefings, at times bringing on progressive lawmakers and activists.
Mr. Sanders hasn't indicated any intention to quit the race. His spokesman said recently that he would
participate in a presidential debate
in April if the Democratic National Committee held one.
""He is being extremely presidential and he's showing us exactly the way a leader would act in this moment,"" said Katherine Abegg, 43, a textile research and development manager who lives in Brooklyn.
Ms. Abegg wasn't alone in her passion for Mr. Sanders. Eleven of the 25 people interviewed by The Journal said they would have a difficult time voting for Mr. Biden in November and planned to write in a name at the top of their ballot, leave it blank or stay home on election day.
""I don't want to show loyalty to a party that isn't showing loyalty to me,"" said Quentin Kanta, 20, a college student living in Monmouth, Ore.
Most of those who said they would not cast their ballots for Mr. Biden justified their position by saying they lived in states that were likely to vote for the Democrat anyway. However, Sanders supporters with whom the Journal spoke in Arizona, a 2020 battleground state, Idaho and Tennessee, both of which generally vote Republican, also said they wouldn't cast ballots for Mr. Biden.
An aide to Mr. Biden declined to comment beyond pointing to polling that shows the former vice president
leading Mr. Trump in swing counties
.
Just one of the Sanders supporters interviewed, 58-year-old Brenda Wilson of Cleveland, said Mr. Sanders should exit the race soon. Ms. Wilson said she is likely to cast her ballot for Mr. Biden when Ohio votes in June. ""I still love him,"" she said of Mr. Sanders, adding that if he remains in the race, he could hurt Mr. Biden's chances against Mr. Trump.
""I'm a true believer if there's a stronger candidate, we should go with you,"" she said.

The
Democratic primary race
has divided voters into two clear coalitions, one backing Sen. Bernie Sanders's call for
revolutionary change
and one drawn to the quieter tone and more incremental policies proposed by former Vice President Joe Biden.

Super Tuesday
supplied one surprising reason that Mr. Biden's coalition, so far, is the larger one: President Trump, a force from outside the Democratic Party, is helping to change the
Democratic electorate
, making it more friendly to Mr. Biden's style of politics.
The shift in voting patterns has emerged from exit polls as well as ballots cast by nearly 14 million Americans in 16 Democratic primaries and three caucuses. Voters surged to the polls this week in the affluent suburbs outside big cities—among them Nashville, Houston, Richmond, Va., and Washington, D.C.—producing a voter pool that was
more moderate in its politics
than in 2016 and more supportive of Mr. Biden than his main opponent.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do you think voters are firmly fixed in one political party or do people cross party lines in their voting choices? Join the conversation below.
Mixed in among the Democrats were voters such as Paige McIntosh of Fairfax County, Va., a lifelong Republican who cast the first Democratic primary ballot of her life. Her vote was both an embrace of Mr. Biden and a rejection of Mr. Trump. ""I want someone moderate to vote for. I'm desperate for someone moderate to vote for,"" said Ms. McIntosh, 48, who owns a landscaping business. ""I worry about the tenor in this country, where it's very, very divisive.""
The changes Mr. Trump brought to the Republican Party have been powerful in the political marketplace, giving the GOP the White House and protecting its Senate majority. Reading the Tuesday election results, political analysts found evidence that they had also changed the Democrats.

With his assertive style and focus on the ""forgotten"" men and women with weakened economic prospects, ""the president accelerated the migration of upscale, suburban moderates into the Democratic Party and accelerated the migration of the white, working-class to the Republican fold,"" said David Wasserman, a political analyst at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.
The result, as seen in Mr. Biden's victories in 10 of 14 states on Tuesday, was counterintuitive for a party whose candidates are pushing policies to the left of those of the Obama administration. When it comes to how voters view themselves, ""the Democratic Party is less progressive than it was in 2016, not more,"" Mr. Wasserman said.
Exit polls in many states found a shift away from the party's ideological edge, as more primary voters identified as moderate or conservative than in 2016, and fewer called themselves liberal. The share of moderate and conservative voters rose by 15 percentage points in Virginia, 6 points in Massachusetts, by three in Tennessee and Alabama and two in Texas—all states that Mr. Biden won. In addition to feelings about Mr. Trump, the lack of a competitive GOP primary may have prompted some moderate or conservative voters to participate in the Democratic primary. If so, that could suggest that while the pool of voters in Democratic primaries has become more moderate, the party retains a significant core of liberal members.
Mr. Trump agrees that voters are changing affiliation, but he sees movement to the GOP. ""The insanity of the Democratic Party is why millions of registered Democrat voters are joining our movement. They are joining our great Republican Party,"" the president said late last month at a rally in South Carolina, where he criticized Democratic proposals to toughen gun regulations, relax immigration laws and replace private insurance with Medicare for All.
If patterns hold and some Republicans remain open to crossing party lines, the shift could have big implications for November. Democrats could have a larger pool of voters to appeal to as Mr. Trump tries to poach voters from core Democratic groups, such as African-Americans, Hispanics and working-class, white voters, who were once a pillar of the Democratic Party.
Exit polls from Super Tuesday and earlier contests showed that Mr. Sanders retained much of his coalition from 2016 of young voters and those calling themselves ""very liberal."" The returns also showed that he had added an important new group: Hispanic voters.
Excluding California due to its partial results, the Super Tuesday county that gave Mr. Sanders his largest vote margin was Saguache County, Colo., a rural community with a large Hispanic population, a poverty rate above the national average and household incomes well below the national median. The five counties in which Mr. Sanders improved most over his 2016 vote totals were all heavily Hispanic counties in Texas, near the border with Mexico.
Jennifer Allen, a Latina voter in San Antonio, said the Democratic Party had failed her, and she was ready for Mr. Sanders's plans for government to take a more active role in helping people navigate the economy. A hairdresser who owns her own business, Ms. Allen, 51, said that she had never had health insurance and was stuck with a $15,000 tab for a kidney stone two years ago, which she said was sent to a collections agency, even though she had paid off two-thirds of the bill.
His policies would touch ""everything that would affect my life personally,'' she said.
Mr. Sanders's coalition also has large shares of younger voters, as in 2016, when he carried 71% of Democratic primary voters under age 30, exit polls showed. On Tuesday, three of the five counties that gave Mr. Sanders his biggest vote share, outside of California, were college communities in Colorado and North Carolina.
In Minneapolis, 29-year-old Esther Park said her parents were carrying high medical debt, ""which Bernie will be planning on eliminating."" And she is carrying student debt, which Mr. Sanders would cancel. ""That's been preventing me from living my life to the fullest right now,"" she said.
In contrast to Mr. Sanders's coalition, the five counties that gave Mr. Biden their biggest margins were all largely African-American communities in Virginia and Alabama, where he took 75% of the vote. Black voters have been a core part of his constituency, like that of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary.
Mr. Biden's coalition also includes voters in affluent suburbs. Many that showed big upticks in Super Tuesday voting had backed Sens. Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz over Mr. Trump in the 2016 GOP primaries. Then in 2018, they were part of the suburban wave that helped flip enough seats to give Democrats a majority in the U.S. House.
Though the number of party switchers is thought to be only a small share of the Democratic voter pool, analysts said this showed that at least some of the Democratic votes this week were coming from disaffected Republicans and independents. ""The Democratic Party, in terms of who is in it now, is not as liberal as before in the sense that you have a lot of former Republicans who are now Democrats,"" said Doug Sosnik, a longtime strategist and White House aide to President Bill Clinton. ""These are people who disproportionately are female, have higher education and live in suburban areas.""
Mr. Sanders, asked Friday about Mr. Biden's expansion of the electorate with suburban voters, said: ""We're doing the best that we can…this is a unique campaign in the modern history of this country.""
Outside Washington, D.C., turnout rose 75% in populous Fairfax County, Va., one of the nation's wealthiest. Like Ms. McIntosh, Republican Deb Schrag, a Fairfax County resident, cast her first-ever vote in a Democratic primary, backing Mr. Biden. ""He has a calming effect. He's not impetuous,"" she said.
Ms. Schrag, 55, who runs a surgery center, said she has been a lifelong member of the GOP and served as public-relations chairman of the college Republicans while a student at Virginia Tech.
In many cases, the Democratic Party can't count on long-term support from Tuesday's crossover votes. Ms. McIntosh and Ms. Schrag said they were not fully in the Democratic fold and might vote for Republican candidates down-ballot. ""Absolutely,"" said Ms. McIntosh, ""with pleasure.""

The presidential primaries aren't the only important elections taking place Tuesday. In several of the
Super Tuesday states
, voters will also cast ballots in closely watched congressional primary races.
The outcome of some of
these competitive races
could help determine whether Democrats can keep control of the House of Representatives and Republicans can maintain their hold on the Senate. Here's a look at some of the top races:
California 25th Congressional District
The decision of Rep. Katie Hill (D., Calif.)

to resign last year
has opened up the race for this competitive district outside Los Angeles. Christy Smith, a state lawmaker, is the heavy favorite to be the Democratic candidate in the fall election, winning the support of national Democrats.
But the divisions roiling the presidential primary have also affected this Democratic race. Cenk Uygur, a left-wing podcast host, briefly received the endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) before Mr. Sanders retracted it. Mr. Uygur has attacked Ms. Smith as insufficiently progressive.
On the Republican side, former Rep. Stephen Knight and Navy veteran Mike Garcia are among those vying to move onto the next rounds of voting.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What kinds of hints do you think the congressional primaries will give about the 2020 presidential election? Join the conversation below.
Residents will technically vote twice in the race on Tuesday—once to decide who wins the special election, and again to determine which two candidates appear on the ballot in the November race.
If no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote in the special election, the top two vote earners will advance to a May runoff to decide who holds the seat through the rest of the year.
Because of differences in turnout, a Republican could win the May runoff for the special election and then lose in November.
North Carolina
Following court-ordered redistricting in North Carolina, Democrats are poised to pick up two congressional seats and bolster their margin in the House. Voters in the new North Carolina second and sixth congressional districts will choose the Democratic nominees who will likely become members of Congress next year. The Republicans who currently hold the seats have said they won't run for re-election.
Deborah Ross—a Democrat who lost a challenge to Sen. Richard Burr (R., N.C.) in 2016—is one of many candidates running in the second district. Many Democrats are running in the sixth district, where the primary could head to a May runoff.
Statewide, national Democrats are hoping Cal Cunningham secures the nomination to run against GOP Sen. Thom Tillis this fall.
Texas Seventh Congressional District
Washington Republicans are hoping that Wesley Hunt, an African-American Army veteran, emerges from Tuesday's election without facing the prospect of a runoff in May. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) has pointed to Mr. Hunt as an example of the kinds of candidates Republicans need to recruit.
President Trump endorsed Mr. Hunt, who will face a crowded field Tuesday that includes Bellaire Mayor Cindy Siegel. The eventual Republican nominee will face Democratic Rep. Lizzie Fletcher, who flipped the Houston-area seat in 2018, in what some analysts see as a bellwether district for Republican efforts to win back ground in 2020.
Texas 12th Congressional District
While this seat is very unlikely to leave Republican hands in November, Rep. Kay Granger is trying to fend off a conservative challenger, Chris Putnam. Ms. Granger is the top Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, which Mr. Putnam has attacked as he argues that Ms. Granger is a Washington insider.
The race has drawn major outside spending. The Club For Growth, a fiscally conservative group, has poured roughly $2 million into opposing Ms. Granger, while the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC affiliated with House GOP leadership, has spent heavily to defend her.
Ms. Granger has pointed to her work funding a wall along the border with Mexico—
Mr. Trump's priority
—to inoculate herself against conservative criticism. House Republicans have been hoping to add women to their ranks, and losing one of their most senior women lawmakers would be a blow to the party.
Texas 22nd Congressional District
Pierce Bush, the grandson of former President George H.W. Bush, is running in a crowded Republican primary to succeed GOP Rep. Pete Olson, who is retiring from the competitive Houston-area seat. Beyond Mr. Bush, top competitors in the GOP race are Troy Nehls, a county sheriff, and Kathaleen Wall, who has spent more than $3 million on the campaign.
Ms. Wall has focused much of her messaging on building a wall along the border with Mexico, rendering the race as yet another test of the potency of embracing Mr. Trump in Republican primaries. If none of the Republican candidates surpass 50% of the vote, the top two will move on to a runoff.
The likely Democratic nominee is Sri Preston Kulkarni, the party's candidate in 2018.

WASHINGTON—The Democratic primary is following a similar trajectory to what Republicans experienced four years ago, when a long-shot candidate with a devoted base gained momentum while his party's establishment politicians squabbled over who was best suited to take him on.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist who fell short of winning the Democratic nomination in 2016, has risen to the top of national polls on the heels of a popular vote win in Iowa and a victory in the New Hampshire primary.
A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey of Democratic primary voters
found Mr. Sanders with 27% support
, a double-digit lead over a crowded field of rivals vying to claim the mantle of the so-called alternative. Four of his opponents—former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg—were all clustered within a few points of each other.
The dynamic mirrors a similar point in the Republican presidential race four years ago, when polls showed Donald Trump
gaining ground over a fractured field
of GOP hopefuls who were viewed as more palatable by party stalwarts.
""Close your eyes: There's a septuagenarian presidential candidate with a pretty indestructible level of support who is leading in several early states—who am I talking about?"" said Matt Gorman, an aide to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's unsuccessful 2016 primary campaign. ""Much like Trump, the press and Beltway audiences don't take seriously his ability to win the nomination and keep waiting breathlessly for that inevitable collapse, and neither is happening any time soon.""
As Republicans did in 2016,
moderate Democrats have begun fretting
that no candidate will be able to consolidate support and defeat Mr. Sanders. They fear he would lose to President Trump in the general election, though the WSJ/NBC News poll shows Mr. Sanders winning a hypothetical matchup between the two. Republicans' fears four years ago that Mr. Trump would cost them the White House and control of Congress proved wrong.
""Bernie Sanders's campaign is a multiracial, multiethnic, multigenerational campaign of working-class Americans fighting for the values of justice and love,"" said deputy campaign manager Ari Rabin-Havt. ""The fact the elites are scared of our movement says more about them than it does about us.""
Much of the criticism of Mr. Trump centered around signature proposals, such as building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and banning all Muslims from entering the U.S., that his Republican opponents viewed as racist, and he made controversial comments about immigrants and women. Mr. Trump, now 73 years old, also defied the party's conventional views on trade policy.
By contrast, the criticism of Mr. Sanders, who is 78, is more policy-focused. His critics believe his proposed single-payer health-care system, free public college tuition and other ideas are too liberal for the U.S. electorate, though many of his rivals have adopted more moderate versions.
At the time, Mr. Trump's rivals alternated between attacking him and treating him as a sideshow. While candidates including Mr. Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and then-Govs. Chris Christie and John Kasich vied to consolidate support among moderate Republicans and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz fought for grass-roots conservatives, the businessman-turned-reality TV star racked up wins in early nominating contests.
""The establishment no longer picks the nominee in either party,"" said Alex Conant, a former aide to Mr. Rubio's campaign. ""If anything, voters really dislike being told who to vote for.""
""The populist candidates have a ceiling,"" he said. ""But you need to unite the rest of the party against them in order to win.""
For much of 2019, aides to other Democratic campaigns insisted Mr. Sanders had his own ceiling. Now, with him near the top of the delegate hunt and polling in the lead in next-up Nevada, his opponents are struggling with how to criticize Mr. Sanders.
""Like Trump, no matter what you throw at him, it's not going to move his base,"" an aide to a rival candidate said.
The aide said campaigns are likely to begin pointing more to Mr. Sanders's self-ascribed identity as a democratic socialist. During Wednesday's
Democratic presidential candidates' debate
in Nevada, Mr. Sanders dismissed a question about a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll that said two-thirds of those surveyed were uncomfortable with a socialist, pointing out that same poll had him leading the Democratic field.
Earlier this month, Mr. Biden—who is struggling to regain footing after poor performances in Iowa and New Hampshire—said every Democrat running for office in 2020 would have to carry the label of a democratic socialist if Mr. Sanders is the nominee.
""What do you think Trump is going to do with that?"" Mr. Biden said.
Mr. Buttigieg has suggested it would be ""difficult"" for Mr. Sanders to defeat Mr. Trump, and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar raised her hand in a recent Democratic debate when the candidates were asked if they were concerned about ""having a democratic socialist on the top of the ticket.""
""We need someone to head up this ticket that actually brings people with her, instead of shutting them out,"" Ms. Klobuchar said.
Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders weren't longtime members of the party they campaigned to represent. Mr. Trump switched his party affiliation several times before registering as a Republican once again in 2012. Mr. Sanders is an independent in the Senate, although he has caucused with the Democratic Party during his three decades in Congress.
In the 2020 Democratic field, Mr. Bloomberg has held elected office as a Republican and independent, while Warren was once registered as a Republican.
Unlike Mr. Trump, who has changed his views over time on issues such as abortion, Mr. Sanders has largely espoused the same proposals for years. His promises of a Medicare for All health-care system, free college and aggressive approach to climate change have been reflected in variations from the other candidates.
This week, a memo from Mr. Bloomberg's campaign warned that Mr. Sanders might soon become unstoppable.
""The fact is if the state of this race remains status quo—with Biden, Pete and Amy in the race on Super Tuesday—Bernie is likely to open up a delegate lead that seems nearly impossible to overcome,"" campaign manager Kevin Sheekey wrote.
Some Democrats believe Mr. Bloomberg, who didn't enter the race until November and has skipped the early states, is ill-positioned to consolidate a combative Democratic field.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do you see the current Democratic field coalescing behind one candidate? If so, which candidate would that be and why? Join the conversation below.
Jennifer Palmieri, a former aide to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, said attempts to stop Mr. Sanders would only make him stronger in the eyes of his supporters.
""He's an unconventional candidate, and it is very hard to run against him,"" she said. ""It's not about his record, it's not about past positions.""
""It's about what he says now and his supporters' belief that he's always held the view of the fundamental change that they think has to happen,"" she added. ""It's about something bigger than just Bernie Sanders.""

Investors are betting the volatility that has rattled markets over the past two weeks is here to stay.
Many are bracing for dramatic swings in stocks as the U.S. presidential election season ramps up and investors assess the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on global economic activity.
Options traders are forecasting increased volatility around key dates tied to the election, including Monday's Iowa caucuses. They are picking up stock hedges that would pay out if turbulence continues to jump in coming months.
Those bets coincide with a pause in the stock market's record run. Worries about the coronavirus have driven the S&P 500 down 3.1% from its Jan. 17 record and into the red for 2020.
Some investors have dished out money for insurance-like contracts tied to a broader pullback. Others have placed targeted wagers on individual sectors, girding for different candidates' positions to spark volatility in corners of the market like health care or financials.
""We saw people start to worry,"" said Ilya Feygin, a managing director at brokerage WallachBeth Capital. ""People had refused to just cut exposure, and they scrambled once the market started going down.""
The gyrations are a reminder of some of the obstacles that could cap further market gains.
Early Monday, China's stock markets -- reopening for the first time since Jan. 23, two days before the start of the Lunar New Year -- fell sharply. The Shanghai and Shenzhen composite indexes were each down more than 7% at midmorning.
While China's markets were closed, Hong Kong's stock market and the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index -- which tracks large Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong -- both fell sharply. Early Monday, the Hong Kong benchmark was up 0.3%.
This week, investors also will get a fresh read on manufacturing activity in the U.S. Last week, earnings from heavyweights such as Caterpillar Inc. and Boeing Co. showed strains in the sector, heightening worries about the economy.
Other bellwether companies including Google parent Alphabet Inc., Ford Motor Co. and Walt Disney Co. will report results in the coming week. And investors will look to Friday's monthly jobs report to see whether the labor market can continue its healthy pace of growth.
Investors are positioned for big moves in the stock market as soon as this week. Options traders are forecasting about a 1.3% move up or down in the S&P 500 on Tuesday, the trading session after the Iowa caucuses, according to data from Cornerstone Macro LLC. They also have been projecting big swings around Super Tuesday in March and the November election, according to Wells Fargo Securities.
Trading activity and options prices have been sensitive to polling figures predicting which Democratic candidate will face off against President Trump in the November presidential election. Activity has surged and dropped as different contenders have gained popularity and investors calculated what effect their policies would have on markets.
""As it seems like Bernie [Sanders] gains in the polls . . . the market's now implying a larger move,"" around the caucuses, said Danny Kirsch, head of options at Cornerstone Macro. ""People are already trying to get in front of the election now.""
Medicare for All proposals by presidential candidates Mr. Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for example, whipped health-care stocks throughout much of last year, making it one of the S&P 500's weaker sectors in terms of performance.
Ms. Warren's proposals also have included breaking up big banks, stirring volatility among those stocks as well.
As a result, options investors are forecasting outsize moves for exchange-traded funds such as the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund and the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund in the coming months, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Traders said they have noticed a pickup in bearish bets against the stock market recently. There have been several large-block purchases of bullish call options on the Cboe Volatility Index, known as the VIX, including in the past week, they said. The options are dated to expire in February and March, with many slated to expire after the coming caucuses and primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire and just before Nevada's caucuses on Feb. 22.
These types of trades have the potential to pay out hefty sums if stock prices swing violently. The VIX tends to rise when stocks fall.
Traders and analysts said the hedging activity is likely fueled by investors seeking to remain invested in stocks and protect their holdings during a potential pullback.
The activity highlights how some investors are preoccupied with broader risks such as the spreading virus and presidential election to markets, rather than individual earnings results.
""The biggest risk this year is political risk,"" said Mark Giambrone, a managing director and portfolio manager at asset manager Barrow Hanley Mewhinney & Strauss LLC. ""Some policies suggested by candidates have been extreme and that's stirred up volatility.""
Some investors said they are reluctant to take the other side of the trade: selling bullish options on the VIX in a wager that markets will revert to calm.
""We just don't know what's going to happen with the coronavirus or Super Tuesday"" in March, said Jim Carney, chief executive of hedge fund Parplus Partners. ""I see no upside to being short market movements right now.""

DES MOINES, Iowa—The first wave of delayed results from the Iowa caucuses showed former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont neck and neck at the top of the pack, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in third and former Vice President Joe Biden a distant fourth.
The release of the results followed a brief news conference Tuesday afternoon with Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price, who said the ""reporting of the results and the circumstances surrounding the 2020 Iowa Democratic Party caucuses were unacceptable.""
With 62% of precincts reporting, Mr. Buttigieg had the largest share of delegates to the state party convention—the measure used to declare the winner of the caucuses—while Mr. Sanders had the second most. But Mr. Sanders led in the raw vote so far, followed by Mr. Buttigieg.
Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden were third and fourth respectively in both counts.
The election debacle that transpired around Monday's caucuses was so severe that even close to a day after the balloting took place, less than two-thirds of the results could be reported. Mr. Price declined to say when all of the state's results would be made public. ""We're going to take the time we need,"" he said.
The chairman said there were ""multiple reporting challenges"" as roughly 1,700 precincts began to feed results into state party headquarters. That triggered caucus-night chaos as the candidates and nation continued to await the outcome of the first presidential nominating contest.
The state party is collecting paper records completed during the precinct meetings. It has attributed the holdup to inconsistencies in data obtained from a mobile app used to report vote tallies.
""We know this data is accurate,"" Mr. Price said. ""We also have a paper trail.""
The mess is severely
threatening the state's status
as the leadoff nominating contest. ""We have been working day and night to make sure that these results are accurate,"" Mr. Price said.

Full Results

With the results in flux, Democratic candidates headed to New Hampshire, which holds the nation's first primary, in one week. Many expressed frustration over the breakdown of Iowa's caucuses and claimed strong performances despite the lack of official results.
Mr. Sanders told reporters traveling with him to New Hampshire that he was ""disappointed"" with the process and state party for not being able to come up with timely results. ""I can't understand why that happens, but it has happened,"" he said.
""It's frustrating to put it mildly,"" Mr. Buttigieg said on CNN of the state party's debacle. He claimed a strong performance in the Iowa contest based on his campaign's own unverifiable numbers. ""By any reckoning, we had an extraordinary night,"" he said.
Ms. Warren said at her first New Hampshire event on Tuesday, ""We know that three of us will be dividing up most of the delegates coming out of Iowa. I'm feeling good.""
Mr. Biden during an appearance in Nashua, N.H., expressed optimism after arriving from Iowa. ""It's like my mother said, 'Hope springs eternal,' "" Mr. Biden said. ""We're not giving up.""
The Iowa Democratic Party said Tuesday morning that it had activated backup measures and entered data manually once officials realized that there were problems with the results that were coming in. It wasn't clear exactly what went wrong, but the party said it wasn't related to a security breach. Volunteers running the precinct caucuses had reported trouble using the mobile app and with a secure phone line established as a backup method to share results.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do you expect either Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders to have an advantage in the New Hampshire primary? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
""We have every indication that our systems were secure and there was not a cybersecurity intrusion,"" the party said.
State party officials in Nevada, where the second caucus of the nominating season will be held, on Feb. 22, pledged that they wouldn't experience the same failures as Iowa.
""We will not be employing the same app or vendor used in the Iowa caucus,"" Nevada State Democratic Party Chair William McCurdy said in a statement. ""We had already developed a series of backups and redundant reporting systems, and are currently evaluating the best path forward.""
Meanwhile, President Trump pounced on the uncertainty, calling the Democratic caucuses an ""unmitigated disaster"" in a Tuesday morning tweet. ""Nothing works, just like they ran the Country,"" he wrote, adding that only he can claim victory in the state following Republican caucuses there Monday. The president is scheduled to deliver
his annual State of the Union address
Tuesday night.
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who had skipped competing in Iowa and the other three early voting states, on Tuesday decided to double his ad spending in targeted markets, and his campaign said he was increasing his staffing to more than 2,000 people.
The reporting was complicated in this year's caucuses by additional data. In response to calls for greater transparency following the close 2016 contest between Mr. Sanders and Hillary Clinton, the state party was to release for the first time the raw total for votes from both rounds of voting, along with the traditional share of delegates won.
Mr. Biden's campaign said in a letter to the Iowa party Monday night that ""acute failures are occurring statewide"" in the party's reporting system. Symone Sanders, a Biden adviser, said Tuesday that the team wanted Iowa Democrats to ""check, check again, triple check, check another time the data.""
Several campaigns released internal, unverifiable data from the caucuses to claim a favorable result early Tuesday. The candidates also took to stages scattered around Iowa's capital to declare their own versions of success.
""I imagine, have a strong feeling, that at some point, the results will be announced,"" said Mr. Sanders. ""And when those results are announced, I have a good feeling we're going to be doing very, very well here in Iowa.""
Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar told her supporters gathered at a caucus night party that they were ""punching above their weight.""
Four Democrats—Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg—have been bunched at the top in recent state polls in New Hampshire.
New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley said it is ""highly unusual to have at this point so many competitive campaigns. Usually we are down to three at the most.""

Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez called for a recanvass of results of the party's
Iowa caucuses
on Thursday while the Associated Press said it was unable to declare a winner, two blows to a state at risk of losing its status as the host of the first presidential nominating contest every four years.
Mr. Perez's public call for an audit of the paper trail from each of more than 1,700 precincts drew renewed attention to the technical glitches and other problems that have
delayed the declaration of a winner
for three days. Those irregularities, which also factored into the AP's decision, cast doubt on the final tallies released by the state party late Thursday.
The party's count showed Pete Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Ind., with a razor-thin edge over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the share of delegates. But Mr. Sanders was ahead in the popular vote.
Shortly after full results were reported by the state party, Mr. Sanders's campaign issued a statement that questioned the validity of the results, while also claiming victory.
""We also feel confident that the discrepancies we're providing tonight, in addition to those widely identified in the national media, mean that the [state delegate equivalents] count will never be known with any kind of certainty,"" Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser, said. ""Given the rules changes we fought for that required the release of the popular vote count, SDEs are now an antiquated and meaningless metric for deciding the winner.""
Buttigieg campaign spokesman Chris Meagher declined to comment on Mr. Weaver's statement.
Earlier Thursday, Mr. Perez took to Twitter to
criticize the process in Iowa
.
""Enough is enough,"" he wrote. ""In light of the problems that have emerged in the implementation of the delegate selection plan and in order to assure public confidence in the results, I am calling on the Iowa Democratic Party to immediately begin a recanvass.""
In a statement later, Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price didn't directly address Mr. Perez's comments but said the party was prepared to conduct a recanvass—which he said would entail auditing the paper records from each precinct caucus—if requested by a campaign, per party rules. None has publicly done so.
The state party's website late Thursday showed results had been reported for all 1,765 precincts.
With 100% of precincts reporting, Mr. Buttigieg's total for state delegate equivalents, the state and national parties' preferred metric, was 564, while Mr. Sanders had 562. The two leading candidates were separated by less than a 10th of a percentage point, so even slight counting errors could affect the outcome.
Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders were followed by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.
The AP's election calls are widely held up as a standard in the news media, and the organization's inability to declare a winner is a further blemish on the Iowa caucuses.
""The Associated Press calls a race when there is a clear indication of a winner. Because of a tight margin between former Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders and the irregularities in this year's caucus process, it is not possible to determine a winner at this point,"" said AP executive editor Sally Buzbee in a statement published by the news service.

What Happens at the Iowa Caucuses

Unlike primaries, which are run by local and state election officials, caucuses are run by state parties and local volunteers. Generally, in contested elections, a recanvass occurs before a recount and is a less involved check of the results.
Mr. Sanders declared victory Thursday based on his lead in raw vote totals in the caucuses, as he decried the Iowa Democratic Party's inability to count votes in a timely manner.
""That screw up has been extremely unfair to the people of Iowa. It has been unfair to the candidates, all of the candidates and all of their supporters,"" he said.
Mr. Buttigieg all but declared himself the winner in a speech Monday evening, saying he was heading to next week's New Hampshire primary ""victorious.""
Mr. Perez's request comes after the DNC approved the state party's delegate-selection plan and was a close adviser during the run up to the caucuses, including having staff members on the ground immediately beforehand.
Democratic Party officials in Iowa have attributed the tabulation problems to a software glitch that triggered inconsistencies in data obtained from a mobile app used to report vote tallies. Paper records were then manually reviewed, the state party has said.
The delays have cost Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg some of the media boost they might have gotten if a clear winner had been declared Monday night, as has typically been done since 1976, when the caucuses first became an important initial stop on the road to the White House.
Mr. Sanders, a 78-year-old progressive whose two campaigns for president have pulled the party to the left, is positioned to potentially win Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, according to the most recent state polling.
Some Democrats outside Iowa have argued that the
state's early status is no longer warranted
, given this year's botched reporting.
Since 1976, seven of nine Democratic winners of the Iowa caucuses have gone on to become their party's nominee. No Democrat who has won both Iowa and New Hampshire has failed to win the nomination during that period.

Odds are that Bernie Sanders wins Iowa, Joe Biden wins the Democratic nomination and Donald Trump wins the presidency—but loses the popular vote (again).
Those aren't my predictions. They're Mr. Market's, thanks to a small but busy domestic futures market in election outcomes, as well a robust overseas betting book.
You can pay 43 cents to win $1 if Sen. Sanders wins the Iowa Democratic caucus, and bet 41 cents to get $1 if Mr. Biden wins the party nomination—the priciest options, representing the likeliest outcomes, available at the moment for those races. It'll set you back 48 cents to win $1 if Mr. Trump rides to victory in November, but only 26 cents to bet he wins popular vote.
Across the Atlantic, bookies in the U.K. will give you 6-to-4 odds that Mr. Biden wins the Democratic presidential nomination—bet $1, you'd win it back along with another $1.50—but 3-to-1 odds that Mr. Sanders does. The odds for Mr. Trump winning in November are almost even, at 10-11, compared with 5-6 for a Democrat generally.
The U.K. bets are technically only available to political junkies outside the U.S. The U.S. generally frowns on Las Vegas-style betting over domestic elections. But commodities regulators have given the nod to a few futures markets designed to produce data for researchers, with some limits.
The granddaddy of the field, the
University of Iowa's Iowa Electronic Markets
has been running nationally since the early 1990s. It offers a winner-take-all market on the presidential popular vote (currently favoring the eventual Democratic candidate) and a vote-share market (roughly 55% for the Democrat), as well as markets on Congressional control. A Democratic presidential-primary market is expected to launch soon.
The more polished
PredictIt
, an online market run by New Zealand's Victoria University of Wellington, offers a wider range of election and other political bets, including markets on which Supreme Court justice will step down next (Ruth Bader Ginsburg at 78 cents) and whether the U.S. House will adopt a third article of impeachment before March 31 (5 cents).
Since they exist for research purposes, both markets put a lid on your losses—and potential gains—to some degree. The Iowa market limits total bets to $500. PredictIt limits an individual's investment in any given contract to $850.
In some cases, betting markets can provide nuanced information, says Alex Donohue, a veteran U.K.-based political betting analyst now at betting-information website US-Bookies.com. Odds in the U.K. suggest punters are skeptical that Michael Bloomberg will win the Democratic nomination—but think he's got a decent chance of beating Mr. Trump if he does.
""A lot of times, you'll see buzz in the betting markets that predates buzz in the polling or in the media,"" Mr. Donohue told me.
Meantime, Mr. Trump's odds, at 10 to 11, aren't as impressive as they seem: Barack Obama's odds were 1 to 3 at a similar point in 2012, and George W. Bush was 1 to 2. (Of course, four years ago, the odds were against Mr. Trump 5-to-1.)
""He's in a pretty poor place relative to other incumbents,"" Mr. Donohue said. ""You would expect an incumbent to have shorter odds to win a second term.""
The election markets offer slightly different standings than some other widely watched measures of the presidential horse-race, including fundraising and opinion polling.
End-of-year campaign finance disclosures show
Mr. Trump leading the pack on that front, followed by Mr. Sanders.
Recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News
polling suggests
that Mr. Biden is in the lead nationally for the Democratic nomination, at 28%. About a third of registered voters in the poll said they are almost certain to vote for Mr. Trump in the general election, while 48% said they were almost certain to vote against him; the rest said it depended on the Democratic nominee.

A 2008 paper
found the Iowa market's ability to predict elections outperforms national polls, while
another paper
suggests those most active in trading in the market—price-setters, in market parlance—tend to make fewer mistakes.
The bottom line: These kinds of predictive markets are your best bet for calling election results, especially this far out or when there's a sudden shift—such as a new scandal—that polls don't immediately reflect.
""They provide a full measure of what's likely to happen on an election-by-election basis that's quite useful,"" said David Rothschild, an economist at Microsoft Research who earned his doctorate from Wharton Business School in market design.
""The favorite doesn't always win,"" says Mr. Rothschild. ""No one should look at the betting market and say the most likely outcome will definitely happen.""
Of course, 2016 proved that point.
