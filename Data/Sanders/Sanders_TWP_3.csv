Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire businessman who is taking steps to run for president, has launched a $100 million digital ad campaign attacking President Trump in the battleground states expected to determine next year's election.
The effort will provide a significant boost to Democratic efforts "" now totaling at least $325 million in public commitments "" to keep the heat on Trump while Democratic candidates battle each other to win the party's presidential nomination. 
'Our thinking is that the general election has already begun,' said Jason Schechter, a Bloomberg spokesman.
The outlay, which far exceeds what any Democratic candidate has raised or spent so far in the race, adds to those of several other outside groups who have devoted money to early swing state campaigns. 
Priorities USA, an independent Democratic nonprofit and super PAC effort, has already spent about $7 million of a $100 million campaign for swing state anti-Trump advertising during the primaries. American Bridge, a group that typically focuses on opposition research, launched a $3 million campaign this week focused on rural white voters as part of an effort expected to reach $50 million.
A third group, Acronym, which is being advised by former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe, has announced plans for $75 million in digital ads against Trump.
The money is intended to challenge the significant advantages of incumbency in presidential campaigns. Trump's campaign announced $156 million in cash on hand at the end of September, after raising $125 million in the previous three months. 
By contrast, the top fundraising Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), has raised less than $75-million through the first three quarters of the year. former vice president Joe Biden, who has led national nomination polls this year, has raised less than $38-million in the same nine months. 
Trump has also dominated Democratic candidates so far on digital spending. On Facebook, the Trump campaign and its affiliates have purchased $14.7 million in ads this year, according to the social network, compared with $5.45 million by South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and $4.3-million by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). 
Much of the early digital spending by candidates is focused on prospecting for more campaign donors, not on persuading swing state voters. An analysis by Priorities USA of recent Trump Facebook ads found that 89 percent of the messages were focused on acquiring new donors and voter information, including spots that ask people to wish Trump a happy birthday or buy campaign gear. 
'Sometimes you spell 'desperation' d-e-m-o-c-r-a-t-s,' Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, said in response to the news of the new Bloomberg digital effort, which was first reported by the New York Times. 
A pro-Trump independent effort, the America First Action super PAC and an affiliated group, has announced a fundraising goal of $300 million for the 2020 cycle to defend Trump in battleground states. That spending is expected to focus on Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan. 

In one Bloomberg ad provided to The Washington Post, Trump's Twitter feed is highlighted along with the message: 'A tweet shouldn't threaten our country's security.' 
The digital campaign began Friday, with plans for spending in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Arizona, according to Bloomberg aides. They said Bloomberg will not appear in the ads, which will nonetheless make clear he paid for them.
'If Mike runs, it is because he believes that Donald Trump is an existential threat, and this demonstrates his commitment to defeating him,' said Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to Bloomberg. 
Bloomberg, one of the world's richest men, has taken several steps to prepare for a bid for the Democratic nomination, including filing paperwork in states with early deadlines to get on the ballot. He has also been calling top party officials to let them know of his plans. 
The move marks a major reversal for Bloomberg, who announced in March that he would not run for president. At the time, he said he was 'clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination' and would instead focus on spending his money in an effort to hurt Trump's chances in swing states. 
But he and his advisers have since concluded that there is a possible route to the nomination because of lingering divisions in the field and the vulnerabilities of the top-polling candidates. 
 The decision to reconsider signals, among other things, a public rebuke of Biden's performance so far. The former vice president has attempted to build a coalition of the same moderate Democrats that Bloomberg would court.

There was no alcohol at the debate watch party that the Tulsi Gabbard campaign threw for supporters in a music school here, but that didn't mean attendees had to forgo the fun of drinking games. 
'That's three for Warren, zero for Tulsi!' said Alen Abramyan, a roofer and Armenian immigrant, counting up the questions the moderators posed to each candidate. He was texting with friends who were at home and taking a shot every time it seemed like Congresswoman Gabbard (D-Hawaii) had been skipped or slighted. 'They're going to be wasted in 10 seconds,' he predicted. 
Twenty minutes later, he announced, 'They're wasted!'
For supporters of the congresswoman, who has been rising in polls and who seemed to pop up in more split-screen arguments in the recent Democratic primary debate than anyone else "" facing an attack from Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) over her party loyalty, battling with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg over their military records as the only veterans on the stage "" feeling left out and marginalized is their high. 

Left out of presidential debates that talk too much about domestic policy and not enough about how the United States has been at war for most of their children's lifetimes. Left out of a Democratic Party that seems, to them, bent on quashing real dissent and examination of its systematic corruption. Left out of a Republican Party that preaches but rarely practices fiscal conservatism, and, to them, seems to be just as corrupt. 
They are members of the armed forces and people from Hawaii now far from home. And, from an informal survey of the crowd, they're often anti-establishment folks or so-called chaos voters who wanted to vote for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in 2016, and when they couldn't, voted for Donald Trump instead. She appears to be more popular among Republicans than Democrats in Iowa, according to a political scientist's analysis. She had the support of 10-percent of independents in a Quinnipiac University poll of New Hampshire that was published earlier this month.
Ask Gabbard's supporters why they're die-hard for her, and certain things come up: her noninterventionist foreign policy stance and her insistence that the United States get out of the business of policing the world, as well as civil liberties, such as the right not to be spied on by the National Security Agency. Authenticity and integrity also come up. They often cite Gabbard's 16 years of military service and her two tours of duty in the Middle East; she's still active in the National Guard.
Over the past month, Gabbard has gone from being a 'huh' on the debate stage "" as in how does she keep qualifying (she's made every debate but September's) "" to a genuine thorn in the side of front-runners and the Democratic National Committee. The Trump War Room Twitter account, affiliated with the president's reelection campaign, tweeted out a remark that Gabbard made during the Atlanta debate last week: 'Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by and for the people,' along with a 100 emoji.
Criticizing her own party on national television while vying to represent the Democrats in the 2020 general election is certainly an un or tho dox strategy. So is labeling Hillary Clinton, the last nominee, 'the queen of warmongers' and the 'personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long,' as Gabbard did in a tweet in October. Although, in fairness, Gabbard only did that after Clinton suggested in an interview that the GOP was 'grooming' Gabbard to run as a third-party candidate and that she was 'a favorite of the Russians.' (Studies of Kremlin-run propaganda do show that Gabbard is mentioned more often and more positively than other Democratic candidates.)
In a 'Saturday Night Live' parody of the Democratic debate, Gabbard was portrayed by Cecily Strong as the night's 'villain.' Strong's Gabbard says 'I smell your fear, and it makes me stronger. I'm wearing the white suit of your fallen hero, Hillary Clinton.' 
Indeed, Gabbard is the only person on the stage who seems to have an issue with everyone next to her, the only one telling fellow Democrats that they're all corrupt and they're all bad.
Coincidentally, that's the same reason people like Trump.
'We've certainly seen an increase in momentum recently,' said her father, Mike Gabbard, a Hawaii state senator. 'Thank you, Hillary.'

Unified across party lines
Setting Gabbard, who is the first practicing Hindu member of Congress, even further apart is the way she has come across in debates as if she were a leader beamed in from an apocalyptic future (or the Divergent series) with her all-white pantsuit, her streak of white hair and her unique manner of delivering answers in an affectless monotone straight into the camera, even when addressing other candidates, as if trying to inject her words straight into the veins of the American people.
The 38-year-old was the most-searched candidate during most debates, regardless of her speaking time. 
Gabbard's Democratic rivals have made barbed references to her frequent appearances on Fox News; her meeting with President-elect Trump in 2016; and her even more criticized meeting with President Bashar al-Assad while on a trip to Syria, and how she refused to call him a war criminal.

She was the last candidate to make the Atlanta debate, barely reaching the requirement of polling above 3 percent in four national polls less than a week before the DNC's deadline. Her single-digit national polling numbers (with slightly higher single-digit numbers in Iowa and New Hampshire) indicate she has an in cred ibly long shot to be the nominee.
What's missing from the analysis, though, is that Gabbard's outsider status is only making her stronger, according to watch-party attendees who see themselves as part of a growing community of unlikely allies, unified across party lines by how much they love Gabbard and by how much they're fed up with politics.
At the watch party, the room was fired up the second Gabbard walked in, half an hour after midnight. 
'Tulsi! Tulsi! Tulsi!' they chanted. 
Gabbard did not hold back when she took the stage. She called out her rivals for perpetuating 'the Bush-Clinton-Trump doctrine of intervention and regime-change wars' and for being 'stuck in this Washington establishment elite mind-set' that 'underestimate the voices of the people in this country across party lines.'
All she heard in the debate, she said, was 'more of the same, more smears and lies and misinformation because they're afraid of the truth.'
'They're scared of Tulsi!' someone shouted. 
But here in this room, she was also softer and more approachable than she has come across in any debate. She praised her supporters for the 'incredible, beautiful, unifying coalition' they were building. She didn't ask for money, but for everyone there to be her messengers. 
She sounded almost like a spiritual leader, and a little like Marianne Williamson, the author and presidential candidate who hasn't been in a debate since July. 
Faced with unwarranted criticism, Gabbard said, it was necessary 'that we fight back with aloha and with the truth. That we fight back with strength and with love and with light. This is the only way that we defeat this darkness that has cast a shadow over our country, over our brothers and sisters, over our people for so long. Are you in?'
Of course they were. 
'Tulsi! Tulsi! Tulsi!' 
Who was in that room?
Colin Porter, an ROTC student from Athens, Ga., said he registered as a Democrat specifically to vote for Gabbard and her foreign policy of noninterventionism. 
Had she been on a phone call with the new Ukrainian president, he said, he believed Gabbard would withhold aid, too, 'because I think probably Gabbard's position is to reduce military aid to a lot of varied countries, and she'd do it regardless,' he said. 'And I agree with that. I don't think it's the U.S.'s responsibility.' 
He voted for Gary Johnson in 2016. 
'I feel betrayed by the Republican Party,' said his father, Chris Porter, a corporate pilot who was also there cheering Gabbard on. He's an undecided conservative who didn't vote for Trump in 2016, but wouldn't rule it out for 2020. 
They'd been joined by Lorenzo, a defense worker who spoke on the condition that only his first name be used because he's under review to join the National Guard. In talking about Gabbard, he mentioned Dwight D. Eisenhower's warnings about the military-industrial complex. He wouldn't be the last to mention Eisenhower. 
A young bearded man in a fleece vest approached them with high-fives. He was a law student named James Lyman who had reluctantly voted for Clinton in 2016.
Like many who came out that night, he saw Gabbard's meeting with Assad as positive. 'All she ever did was meet with him. That doesn't mean she supports him. She also met with the opposition in Syria,' Lyman said. 'Talking to people and diplomacy used to be valued. Democrats used to support that.'
'It's a phenomenon'
Gabbard's fiery anti-establishment stances have earned her support from Joe Rogan, an extremely popular podcaster with libertarian views who likes to rail against politically correct culture and wokeness. Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey made the maximum personal donation to her campaign after the first debate.
Gabbard's support is, according to several polls, overwhelmingly male. They've also said that it doesn't hurt that she's good-looking and surfs.
'It's a phenomenon,' says Garland Favorito, a retired systems analyst who says he's 'Tulsi or bust' "" meaning he won't vote Democratic unless Gabbard is the nominee. 'She's [former congressmen] Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich wrapped up in a more attractive package.' 
Paul and Kucinich both ran for president and both became conduits for noninterventionist, anti-establishment voices within their own parties. Many of the people at the watch party mentioned that they started supporting Gabbard after she stepped down as DNC vice chair to endorse Sanders's 2016 run for the party's nomination.
The watch party was only a three-minute drive from the debate at Tyler Perry Studios, but it felt even more on the fringe than that. 
Whereas Gabbard's reception among her fellow Democrats had been icy, here, the atmosphere was warm and folksy. The food on offer was Costco pizza, lemonade served out of one of those orange coolers that Super Bowl winners dump on their coaches' heads, and a sloppy tray of overcooked penne with marinara sauce. Two college students from Hawaii who had taken a gap year to become full-time volunteers manned the merchandise table.
Her father had brought along three friends with whom he played in a folk band back in high school in the 1960s. They sang Simon and Garfunkel and a song Mike had written for his daughter: 'She'll do the right thing for you and me / Tulsi in 2020.'
Her uncle Bill Gabbard, who just moved to Atlanta, said there's no way she's going to mount a third-party candidacy: 'We've known her her whole life, and when she says that's not gonna happen, that's not gonna happen.'
Joining Tulsi as she rushed to the party from the debate were her husband, Abraham Williams, who was manning a video camera, plus both of his parents. Tulsi's sister, Vrindavan Gabbard, who famously complained on Twitter about Tulsi's lack of airtime during the first debate, had since quit her job to work full time on her sister's campaign.
Vrindavan stood on a chair to get a group photo of Tulsi with whoever was left of the 150-merry outsiders who had lasted until the end of the night. Some stayed until 2 a.m., chatting about Tulsi and how she had made them feel like they finally had a community and someone they could trust and believe in.
At the end of her speech, Tulsi looked around the room and apologized for the terrible cold she's been fighting off. 'I wish I could personally give you a hug,' she said. 'You don't want my germs. Trust me. They're terrible.'
'Give them to Biden!' someone shouted.
'No,' she said, laughing. 'I don't wish this on anyone.'

Wide field could weaken democrats
Some bracing for fight to extend into summer
Democrats are bracing for a months-long, drawn-out primary fight featuring several viable candidates that could drag into the summer.
That scenario is prompting the campaigns, several of which have signed up veteran delegate counters, to begin strategizing for a protracted nomination slog, with some even playing out scenarios for dealmaking in the weeks leading up to the Democratic convention in July.
'What's different is the number of candidates who can lay claim to being serious enough to win delegates,' said Elaine Kamarck, a member of the party's Rules Committee and the author of the book 'Primary Politics.' 'That alone can result in someone with a plurality.'
The anxiety is the result of an unusually wide-open race. Less than three months before Democrats cast their first primary votes, none of the party's presidential candidates is polling regularly above 30 percent. At least four are on track to earn delegates in Iowa. And now, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, one of the world's richest people, says he might spend hundreds of millions of dollars to attract voters down the stretch. 
Broadly, the Democrats' fear is that the surging energy and turmoil in their party, and its passion to defeat President Trump, may be leading to fracturing rather than unity. Some in the party worry that could hamper its ability to defeat Trump, although others argue that a tough primary will strengthen the eventual nominee.
Three party veterans, who have each worked on delegate strategies in past presidential contests and spoke on the condition of anonymity because of their current positions, described the landscape as unprecedented.
'I have never seen a situation where the likelihood that this thing will go to a convention without a candidate having a majority of the delegates is higher than it is today,' said one of the strategists, who assumes Bloomberg will formally enter the race and win some delegates. 'You will have multiple winners at the front end, none of whom will match the resources of a person at the end of the process.'
The operatives point to other factors, including the increasing role of small-dollar fundraising, which allows candidates to stay in longer, and the diminished role of superdelegates, whose function was to rally the party around a nominee if needed.
They also point to Sen. Bernie Sanders's medical and political rebound from a heart attack, which suggests he could battle Sen. Elizabeth Warren for liberal voters for months. One delegate counter admitted to concluding it is now 'more likely than not' that no one gets a majority of pledged delegates, largely because of Sanders's continued strength and the likelihood that he will continue to campaign even if he is trailing late in the primary contest.
This is a starkly different landscape than the last two protracted Democratic battles, when Barack Obama bested Hillary Clinton in 2008 and Clinton outlasted Sanders in 2016, several strategists said.
'In the past two contested fights of 2008 and 2016, they were two-person races, and in a two-person race one inevitably has a majority,' said Jeffrey Berman, a delegate counter and Rules Committee member who recently worked for former congressman Beto O'Rourke's campaign. 'Once you get a third candidate in the race that is pulling delegates away, then you start looking at the possibility of no candidate having a majority.'
The scenario is by no means certain. Democrats have a history of rallying around early winners, and polls are almost certain to shift in the coming weeks as Democratic voters begin to solidify their preferences. There is also an overwhelming desire in the party to find the single candidate best able to take on Trump, which could increase the pressure for candidates to drop out if they have no clear path to a majority.
The Democratic votes kick off Feb. 3 with the Iowa caucuses, followed quickly by contests in New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. Those states have widely different demographics, so three or even four candidates could emerge from the early phase with victories under their belt. 
That leads to Super Tuesday on March 3, when more than a dozen states, including delegate-rich Texas and California, will cast their votes.
Sanders's campaign, for one, is operating on the assumption that the party will coalesce after those early votes and that Bloomberg's money will have little impact later in the process.
'I think you come out with one or two candidates out of Super Tuesday,' said Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to Sanders. 'The proportional delegate system that the Democratic Party uses makes it difficult to make up a lot of lost ground once you fall behind.' Under party rules, states do not award all their delegates to a single winner but divide them among all who meet a certain threshold.
Yet the idea that at least three viable candidates will emerge from Super Tuesday has become a working assumption for other presidential campaigns, including that of former vice president Joe Biden, who leads in national polls but has fallen behind in Iowa surveys. 
Greg Schultz, Biden's campaign manager, has argued that the Biden coalition, which comprises a diverse geographic and racial constituency, would fare well in a drawn-out process, when the battle could hinge on who wins delegates in particular congressional districts. 
'Math is on our side when it comes to diverse popular support and the pursuit of delegates, and delegate math is a cornerstone of our strategy,' Schultz said. 'We have a broad coalition, and the way we ensure our success is by keeping as many of the different buckets of the Democratic Party, by plurality, supporting Joe Biden.'
Bloomberg's advisers, who have announced that the former mayor would skip the first four state contests if he runs, also believe the field is likely to remain split between three or more viable candidates after those states have their say. The continued strength of Sanders and Warren is a key to that calculation.
'The progressive wing is split,' said a Bloomberg adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy. 'If that lane was consolidated, it would be more difficult.'
For all the campaigns, a close study of the Democratic Party's often-obscure rules has now become mandatory, with several campaigns employing specialists to work out the esoterica of where to campaign and how to spread resources. 
The first phase of the nomination process is often a game of expectations, based on intangible concepts such as buzz, momentum and energy. The second phase, which begins Feb.-3, is about hard numbers, and one number matters far more than the others: 15 percent. 
That's the qualifying level for earning delegates to the Democratic convention, and it is imposed at both the statewide and congressional district level. States award most of their delegates based on a candidate's performance in individual districts; districts that have more Democratic voters receive more delegates.
'Three candidates being over 15 is really the thing that creates the likelihood of a brokered convention,' said the veteran Democratic delegate strategist who now expects an inconclusive result. 'The reason a brokered convention is more likely than not these days is really Bernie Sanders more than Michael Bloomberg.'
The notion of a brokered convention can conjure up images of impassioned floor fights, backroom deals and frenetic horse trading among candidates. The more likely scenario in the current era, political experts say, is that any such negotiation would unfold in the weeks leading up to the convention, so that by the time of the gathering, July 13-16 in Milwaukee, the nominee's identity would be clear.
Delegates are selected with the approval of the candidate who wins them. But they are not bound to vote for that candidate, allowing for defections or for a candidate to instruct his delegates to support a rival. 

The last significant three-way delegate contest in the Democratic Party took place in 1984, when the Rev. Jesse Jackson won about 18 percent of the available delegates, compared with 38 percent for former vice president Walter Mondale and 36 percent for Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado.
Mondale won the nomination at the convention largely by grabbing the support of a majority of superdelegates "" party leaders and dignitaries who have voting rights at the convention.
Under rule changes since the 2016 election, superdelegates will still be seated at the 2020 convention, forming 15 to 20 percent of the delegate pool, but they cannot vote on the first ballot if that would decide the outcome. 
The change was made in part because of complaints of a 'rigged' system by Sanders supporters in 2016. It removes a fail-safe that was designed to avoid a drawn-out convention battle, possibly increasing the pressure on candidates to strike a deal before the convention if no one has a majority.
That could lead to unity tickets, either among liberal or moderate candidates, or it could give more minor candidates with just a few delegates a major role in the outcome. 
Although the scenarios for a volatile convention are remote, they have begun worrying some Democratic insiders. Superdelegates can still vote on the second ballot, adding an element of unpredictability to the negotiations, especially if a candidate like Sanders, who has strained ties to the party establishment, is still in the hunt for the nomination. Biden's team has expressed confidence that the superdelegates would rally around him on a second ballot. 
To avoid such divisive scenarios, Democratic leaders and activists could try to settle on a nominee sooner. More than half of the available pledged delegates are scheduled to be awarded over three consecutive Tuesdays in March, making calls for party unity a likely focus of the campaigns.
Several activists have begun voicing concern that a delay in picking the nominee "" and the resulting intraparty bitterness "" could hand Trump a gift in the general election.
'I think it could be a disadvantage, because you won't have a decision until late in the game,' said David Brock, a Democratic strategist who has raised $30 million through a group called American Bridge to run ads against Trump. 'It is a recipe for a divided party.'

Some posts attacked Biden, praised Trump; others touted Sanders
Facebook on Monday said it removed a network of Russian-backed accounts that posed as locals weighing in on political issues in swing states, praising President Trump and attacking former vice president Joe Biden - illustrating that the familiar threat of Russian interference looms over the next U.S. presidential race.
Facebook said the network bears the hallmark of the same Kremlin-backed group that interfered in the 2016 election by sowing social discord, seeking to boost Trump and attacking Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The new disinformation campaign appears to follow the same playbook.
This time, a coordinated group of Russian accounts that appears to show links to the Internet Research Agency largely took to Facebook's photo-sharing app, Instagram, to post content this year about U.S. politics and memes targeting Democratic presidential contenders.
The operation demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of the schisms within the Democratic Party as it labors to choose a nominee to face Trump in 2020. One Russian account, which portrayed itself as a black voter in Michigan, used the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag to hammer Biden for gaffes about racial issues. Some of the accounts touted one of his rivals on the left, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
The Russian network was the subject of one of four takedowns Facebook announced Monday; it also disabled three misleading campaigns originating in Iran. Researchers said the efforts demonstrated how those seeking to interfere in U.S. politics continue to exploit radioactive topics, including racial and religious fault lines. And they said it offered fresh evidence that foreign actors are pursuing new platforms that rely on a steady stream of images, making detection more difficult despite Facebook's heightened investments in election security.
""We are seeing again that the aim of the Russians is not exclusively to favor one candidate over another but to create divisiveness within the electorate overall,"" said Paul M. Barrett, deputy director of New York University's Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. ""The reason that networks of phony accounts are drawn to Instagram is because disinformation is increasingly visual in nature, and that's what Instagram specializes in.""
The disclosure from Facebook served as more evidence of what Trump has repeatedly questioned - that Russian actors not only interfered in the 2016 election but are also continuing their efforts to interfere in American democracy. The task of safeguarding U.S. elections from interference by Russia and other foreign actors has been a source of tension in the Trump administration, with the president repeatedly calling the allegations of Russian involvement in 2016 a ""hoax"" and top security officials being forced to tiptoe around the issue.
U.S. investigations have confirmed the extent of Russia's attempt to interfere in the 2016 presidential race. Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III obtained multiple indictments last year of individuals affiliated with the Internet Research Agency. This month, a bipartisan report produced by Senate investigators concluded again that the Russian effort sought to boost Trump and undermine Clinton in the eyes of social media users.
Speaking to The Washington Post last week, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the problem posed by disinformation has worsened since 2016, and he attributed that in part to a poor initial response by the U.S. government to the threat. ""Unfortunately, the U.S. did not have a particularly strong response to Russia after 2016,"" he said, ""so it sent the signal to other countries that they could get in on this, too.""
Facebook's announcements came two days before Zuckerberg is set to appear on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are likely to press him on the company's work to safeguard U.S. elections from foreign manipulation.

Zuckerberg said in an interview last week that Facebook is in a ""much better place now"" to stop disinformation campaigns, citing the company's investments in tens of thousands of new staff hires and artificial intelligence that can spot fake accounts and dubious posts in real time. The company further fine-tuned its policies Monday, pledging to more prominently alert users when viral content is determined to be false. Announcing the changes, Zuckerberg stressed he now has ""some confidence our systems here are working.""
""Elections have changed significantly since 2016,"" he told reporters, ""and Facebook has changed, too.""
Researchers said Facebook - in spotting and disclosing the Russian network Monday faster than it had in the past - demonstrated it had improved its digital defenses. Companies such as Facebook are ""building muscle memory around understanding malicious actors on their platform,"" said Graham Brookie, the director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab.
But Brookie said Facebook's takedown showed that Russia's tactics would continue to evolve, as well. ""To steal a phrase, a picture is worth a thousand words, and meme-based content is still extremely effective and much harder to detect,"" he said.
The Biden campaign applauded Facebook for disabling the fake accounts but said Trump's penchant for falsehoods posed just as great a challenge for the company, which has refused to fact-check political advertising placed by the president's reelection campaign.
""Unfortunately, like the Kremlin, Donald Trump continues to benefit from spreading false information, [and] all the while Facebook profits from amplifying his lies and debunked conspiracy theories on their platform,"" TJ Ducklo, a Biden campaign spokesman, said in a statement. ""If Facebook is truly committed to protecting the integrity of our elections, they would immediately take down Trump's ads that attempt to gaslight the American people.""
Facebook described the Russian network as a ""well-resourced operation"" focused on the United States and reliant on sophisticated steps to conceal the identity and location of those behind the fake accounts. It comprised 50 accounts on Instagram and one on Facebook, all of them created this year.
The network appeared to be in an audience-building phase when it was removed by Facebook: 246,000 accounts followed one or more of the inauthentic Russian accounts, which had collectively made just fewer than 75,000 posts, according to a report from Graphika, a social media analysis firm that examined the operation for Facebook. Only one account, which addressed environmental themes, had more than 20,000 followers.
Much of the content lacked text, consisting only of memes, and the posts often drew from viral content first posted by American actors, including news organizations and prominent political figures, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).
The accounts had not yet developed their own voice, which analysts say is critical to achieving a mass following.
""These accounts were trying really hard to hide,"" said Ben Nimmo, Graphika's director of investigations. "". . . It looks like these accounts were sacrificing engagement for security. That's a very defensive strategy.""
Nimmo said Facebook's action was at least the fourth takedown since 2017 of operations targeting the United States that seemed to bear links to the Internet Research Agency. The apparent connection to the St. Petersburg company and ""troll farm,"" owned by an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, went beyond overlap with the thematic focus and targets of past Kremlin-backed campaigns. Some of the accounts taken down Monday had posted memes attributed to previous IRA efforts - but had sought to rebuild them from scratch, rather than simply reposting them, and had made attempts to remove the original IRA watermarks.
A minority of the posts focused explicitly on the 2020 election, according to Graphika's analysis. Among the accounts posing as backers of political and social causes in the United States, the largest cluster was conservative and in support of Trump. Numerous accounts aimed their fire at Democratic candidates - namely Biden but also Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.). Other issues included racial activism, Confederate pride, gun rights, LGBT issues, feminism, Islam and Christianity.
Nearly half of the accounts claimed to be based in swing states, with a specific focus on Florida.
Biden came under attack from accounts that positioned themselves on both sides of the political spectrum. One account reposted a tweet from a right-wing political commentator parroting a Trump rebuke of Biden, while another posted a meme showing a road diverging and a car swerving to choose the path representing ""Bernie 2020"" over ""Joe Biden."" Four years earlier, Russian-backed Facebook accounts similarly promoted Sanders during the Democratic primary against Clinton, according to Senate investigators.

His campaign struggled to gain financial steam in 3rd quarter
Former vice president Joe Biden's presidential campaign struggled to gain financial steam in the past three months - spending money at a faster clip and having a smaller campaign war chest than his top competitors, according to new filings released Tuesday night.
The former vice president entered the final quarter of 2019 with significantly less cash on hand than other candidates who are leading in polls or fundraising. And his share of low-dollar donations - which can signal enthusiasm for his candidacy - was significantly lower.
Biden's lackluster finances were revealed amid growing concerns among some of his allies that his campaign is not equipped for the onslaught of attacks by President Trump. Trump and the Republican Party have already launched a $10 million ad blitz, largely aimed at Biden over his son's business ties to Ukraine.
Meanwhile, Trump's ballooning reelection campaign shattered fundraising records in the third quarter, and his campaign continued to pull a steady stream of money from donors giving less than $200, new filings show.

The two candidates vying for the Democratic nomination who lead in fundraising - Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) - have eschewed wealthy backers and fancy fundraisers. Biden, meanwhile, has relied on a more traditional fundraising model, appearing at private fundraisers catering to the party's wealthy donors.
The limitations of Biden's strategy were reflected in his figures from the third quarter - a notoriously difficult time for raising money through private fundraisers, due to the summer lull.
Among Biden's biggest expenses in the third quarter were $924,000 spent on EJCR LLC, a company that offers private jet charter services, records show. In comparison, Warren and Sanders spent considerably less on private air charters, filings show.
Biden campaign officials said they are confident they have the resources they need to build a winning presidential campaign. The campaign declined to expand on details of his expenses.
""The fundamental question about fundraising is: Do you have what you need to run your race? And we do,"" said Kate Bedingfield, Biden's deputy campaign manager.
Meanwhile, Trump's reelection campaign and two affiliated committees raised $85 million in the third quarter, filings show. Along with the Republican National Committee, pro-Trump committees have $158 million on hand, Trump's campaign said Tuesday.
Among the biggest donors to Trump Victory, one of the affiliated committees, were prominent Trump donors: Thomas J. Barrack Jr., billionaire executive chairman of Colony NorthStar ($360,000); Blackstone Group chief executive Stephen Schwarzman ($250,000); and Ray Washburne, former head of Overseas Private Investment ($100,000).
Three registered federal lobbyists with ties to the Trump campaign and administration reported raising $910,000 for Trump Victory: Brian Ballard, Jeffrey Miller and Jason Osborne, filings show.
Main campaign expenses for Trump include $4.6 million to American Made Media Consultants, a company that places ads for the reelection. Parscale Strategy, the company owned by Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale, billed the campaign $512,304 for consulting services.
Trump's main campaign committee saw a surge in legal fees in the third quarter, paying more than $2 million to various law firms. And Trump properties continued to benefit from the reelection effort, with Trump Victory spending $130,000 at the president's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla.
The top fundraisers of the quarter were Sanders ($25.3 million); Warren ($24.7 million); Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. ($19.2 million); Biden ($15.7 million); and Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California ($11.8 million).
Sanders had $33.7 million cash on hand at the end of the quarter, filings show. Warren had $25.7 million, Buttigieg had $23.4 million, Harris had $10.5 million, and Biden had $9 million.
Among the five, Harris and Biden spent more money in the third quarter than they raised.
The biggest expenses among the five campaigns this quarter went toward payroll, travel and advertising, as candidates built their ground operations in early primary states.
Biden spent $6.7 million in payroll and payroll taxes, $1.3 million on travel, and $2 million in digital and media ad buys.
Sanders spent nearly $7 million on payroll and associated costs and $3.8 million on fundraising and digital ads, among other major expenses.
Among the Warren campaign's biggest expenses were $7.5 million in payroll, $3.5 million in digital media and $834,000 in travel.
Some of Buttigieg's big-ticket items included $3.1 million on Facebook ads, $1 million on Google ads, and $5 million on payroll and related fees.
Harris spent $3.8 million on salary and related costs and $3.4 million on digital and media buys.
The filings made public Tuesday night covered the period from July 1 through Sept. 30. Most of the major presidential campaigns had released their total hauls before the filing deadline but had not released details of their spending, which were reported Tuesday night with the Federal Election Commission.

Young adults say it's 
a mistake for presidential 
 campaigns to neglect them
There's at least one thing young Democrats and Republicans can agree on: 2016 changed everything.
For college-aged liberals, President Trump's victory motivated them to get involved in the political process so they can vote him out of office, said Kara Kline, president of an organization for Democrats at George Mason University in Virginia. For those on the conservative side, Trump's win proved they could elect a president who reflects their interests.
'It's made young voters realize that elections have consequences and that if you want a certain outcome, you have to get out and vote,' said Michael Klein, a 21-year-old Catholic University student who describes himself as politically conservative. 'It's a very real process. It's not some far-off concept that doesn't really affect us.'
Voter participation among 18- to 29-year-olds surged between 2014 and 2018 "" from 20 percent to 36 percent of registered voters in that group, according to the Census Bureau. Now, college students in the District, many of whom selected their schools to be closer to national politics, have a message for the candidates they plan to support in 2020: Use us.
'I hope that the parties and the candidates know that young voters are engaged in the process,' said AJ Williamson, a junior and a Democrat at Georgetown University. 'There's a stereotype that young people are apathetic. I hope they know there is a change in that.'
College students have assignments to complete and exams to pass, but a lot of them are also organizing their peers for local and national elections. They want to shed the stereotype of being uninterested in politics. And they want politicians to include them in their campaigns.
Young people on D.C.-area campuses are hoping to tap into the energy that has defined political movements such as Black Lives Matter and March for Our Lives. But they report feeling like an untapped resource.
'We have so many able bodies "" young Republicans eager to get involved in the election process,' said Joey Rodriguez, a member of a college Republicans group at George Washington University.
Mike Burns, national director of the nonpartisan Campus Vote Project, said he agrees that candidates don't spend enough time with Generation Z, the oldest of whom were born in 1997, according to the Pew Research Center. 
'I find it counterintuitive that you don't see more campaigns invested,' Burns said about outreach efforts that target young people.
A shortage of registered voters could be part of the issue, Burns said. As of November 2018, about 45 percent of people ages 18 to 24 were registered to vote, a rate lower than any other age group, data from the Census Bureau shows. Because of that, candidates may consider it a waste of energy to spend too much time on campuses.
That could change if universities adopt plans to increase voter engagement. Officials at Georgetown announced this month that students can register to vote when they sign up for classes. George Mason has a voting precinct on campus. 
Nigel Johnson, president of Howard University's chapter of College Democrats, wants more people on his campus to vote, too.
'They have this preconceived notion that young people don't vote,' Johnson said of candidates. Thus, he said, politicians adopt the attitude that 'if young people don't vote, what's the purpose of wasting my time talking to them?'
At American University and other campuses, students have formed interest groups to spread their favorite candidate's message. Elliot Williams, 19, gathered about two dozen of his peers this semester to form the school's Students for Bernie chapter.
But before that, he participated in six online training sessions that taught him how to campaign for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
'You, personally, are responsible for mobilizing those voters,' Williams said. 'Traditionally, the campaign is responsible for that.'
About 1,600 students at 627 colleges participated in the same program, said Sanders spokesman Joe Calvello.
Former vice president Joe Biden's campaign has placed a heavy focus on states with early primaries and caucuses. Students in Iowa and South Carolina are being recruited and trained to help their peers become campus organizers, said Jamal Brown, a campaign spokesman.
The campaign of Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) has also prepared young people in early voting states to organize their peers. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) has toured campuses in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina and Georgia.
Tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang's website helps potential supporters connect with student volunteers who promote Yang's platform and host on-campus events, according to S.Y. Lee, a spokesman. And Students With Warren chapters have sprung up at high schools, community colleges and universities, said Alexis Krieg, a spokeswoman for the campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Campaign organizers are planted on campuses in early voting states.
The Republican National Committee and Trump Victory operation launched the 'Make Campus Great Again' initiative to register voters, an RNC official said in an email.
But Williamson, the Georgetown student, said politicians should do more if they want to secure the youth vote, which could be instrumental in the primaries.
'I would personally like to see candidates come out and support things that would make it easier for students to vote and engage in the political process,' he said.
It's not just students in the District who want more attention from politicians. Young people in swing states such as Pennsylvania also want candidates to take them seriously.
In the weeks leading up to the Nov. 5 election in Virginia, Kline and others at George Mason hosted daily phone banks and spent weekends knocking on doors in Fairfax County. Democrats won majorities in the state's Senate and House of Delegates. And candidates supported by the Democratic Party swept all seats on the Fairfax County School Board.
'We're kind of used to being kind of underestimated,' Kline said. 'We're here, we're engaged, we are energetic, and we have a lot of thoughts. I wish everybody would realize that.'
Even though grass-roots efforts to mobilize voters have been bubbling up on campuses, the focus on these institutions leaves out most people between the ages of 18 and 24. In 2017, just 40 percent of young adults were enrolled in college, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.
Johnson, at Howard, suggested that candidates meet young people where they are, including basketball courts and movie theaters. He said the effort is crucial if political leaders want to fulfill the promises they have made on the campaign trail.
The presidential campaign of South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg recently invited students from Howard to an event in the District at which Buttigieg discussed his plan to address racism in education, health care and criminal justice, Johnson said.
'That's just one example of one thing we would like to see candidates doing better,' Johnson said. 'We would like to see candidates reaching out more to invite us to events they have in D.C.'
Seventy-five chapters of Students for Pete are dispersed throughout the country, said Marisol Samayoa, a campaign spokeswoman.
'It's very important for our campaign to engage voters on college campuses and engage young voters, because our candidate is a millennial,' Samayoa said. 'We have a candidate that understands what it's like to live with the consequences of climate change.'
In the months leading up to primaries and caucuses, Johnson is trying to breathe new life into his chapter of College Democrats. He's planning debate watch parties, panel discussions and voter registration events. 
 'It's not in a politician's best interest, in my opinion, to ignore what young people have to say,' Johnson said. 'They like to say they're here for the future of their children, but they don't consult their children on what do they want that world to look like.'

Thursday's Democratic debate in Los Angeles started slowly and collegially, with the candidates focused on President Trump and the voters watching on television. Then the fireworks began.
The sharpened tone of the debate reflected the fact that the Democratic nominating contest is entering a more critical phase, with the first votes in Iowa little more than six weeks away. It also was a sign of the fluidity of the contest and the ups and downs of individual candidates after nearly a year of campaigning.
South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, whose rise in the polls has reshaped the campaigns in Iowa and New Hampshire, found himself at the center of the sharpest attacks. Former vice president Joe Biden, who has remained at the top of national polls through the year, also became an occasional target.
That Buttigieg wore the biggest bull's eye was not unexpected. His rise this fall has threatened the candidacies of many of his rivals, but perhaps none more so than Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).
Buttigieg's surge in Iowa and New Hampshire has come at the expense of Warren, whose candidacy has slid as his has risen. Both appeal in part to the same kind of voters "" well-educated whites. But Buttigieg's rise also has no doubt contributed to blocking the breakthrough that Klobuchar believes will come but has not materialized.
Warren led off the attack on Buttigieg, criticizing candidates who take contributions from wealthy individuals at high-dollar fundraisers, a policy she has eschewed as a presidential candidate. 
Others in the field do this, including Biden, but Buttigieg chose to respond. 'This is our only chance to defeat Donald Trump,' he said. 'And we shouldn't try to do it with one hand tied behind our back. The way we're going to win is to bring everybody to our side in this fight.'
Warren hit back harder. 'The mayor,' she replied, 'just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals and served $900-a-bottle wine. . . . Billionaires in wine caves should not pick the next president of the United States.'
Buttigieg countered again. 'This is the problem with issuing purity tests you cannot yourself pass,' he said.
When Warren then said, 'I do not sell access to my time,' Buttigieg fired back, noting that she had raised money in her Senate campaigns with the same kind of high-dollar fundraisers she was now criticizing. 'Your presidential campaign right now as we speak is funded in part by money you transferred, having raised it at those exact same big-ticket fundraisers you now denounce,' he said.
In the moment, on the stage, it seemed advantage Buttigieg. Whether he sustains that between now and when the voters begin to cast their ballots is another question. He is likely to face continued criticism and scrutiny.
As Warren and Buttigieg were squabbling, Klobuchar broke in to admonish both for their exchanges. 'I did not come here to listen to this argument,' she said. 'I came here to make a case for progress.' 
Minutes later, however, she launched into her own criticism of Buttigieg, accusing him of what she said was his previous mocking of the collective experience of many of his older and more experienced rivals. 
Klobuchar's disdain for the Indiana mayor had surfaced before. In last month's Atlanta debate, she hesitated until the very end of the evening to challenge his youth, relative inexperience and male privilege, as she had done publicly along the campaign trail. 
Her exchange with Buttigieg was less focused but no less pointed than the clash between Buttigieg and Warren. It also was less conclusive. What it revealed was the apparent visceral dislike of both candidates for each other.
Overall, Klobuchar delivered the kind of performance she wanted, one that emphasized her focus on middle-ground policies, Midwestern values, humor and a desire to produce results in office.
Biden drew criticism, as he has before, for his vote to authorize the Iraq War and for his opposition to Medicare-for-all, a central plank in the candidacy of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Biden parried on health care and chose to let the Iraq issue slide by.
More notable, perhaps, was his overall performance, which included some of the strongest moments he has had in any of the six candidate forums. Biden was crisp in defending himself against criticism that he is naive to believe he can gain cooperation of Republicans if he becomes president. 
'I refuse to accept the notion, as some on this stage do, that we can never, never get to a place where we have cooperation again,' he said. 'If that's the case, we're dead as a country. We need to be able to reach a consensus. And if anyone has reason to be angry with the Republicans and not want to cooperate, it's me, the way they've attacked me, my son and my family.'
He was referring to attacks from Trump and Republicans over his son Hunter's position on the board of an energy company in Ukraine while Biden was vice president and calls by some in the GOP for them both to be called to testify in the impeachment hearings or face a congressional investigation.
He showed humor when he was asked whether he could commit to running for a second term, at age 82, if he wins the presidency in 2020. 'No, I'm not willing to commit one way or another. Here's the deal. I'm not even elected one term yet, and let's see where we are. Let's see what happens. But it's a nice thought.'
When the topic of Afghanistan was raised, and the revelations published in The Washington Post about how leaders had misled the public about progress in the war, Biden answered by explaining that he, almost alone among senior officials in the Obama administration, had opposed the troop surge.
This was the first debate with fewer than 10 candidates on the stage. Whether it was the experience of six months of debates or the smaller number of candidates, the debate produced moments helpful to virtually everyone.
Sanders showed his appetite for challenging the economic system. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as in past debates, talked about the challenges of an economy in transition and spoke in language fresher than some of his more experienced rivals. Businessman Tom Steyer showed his commitment to the threat of climate change. Warren showed her passion for attacking corruption.
Thursday's debate, hosted by PBS and Politico and held at Loyola Marymount University, was the sixth of the year for the Democrats. But it delivered no definitive answers to the overriding question for most Democrats, which is who can beat Trump. Biden emerged in a solid position. Buttigieg weathered the first serious attacks. Warren showed determination to mount a comeback. Klobuchar let others know she intends to be a factor in Iowa. Sanders showed he should not be taken for granted.
Thursday marked the final tuneup before election year arrives. The next time the Democrats debate, the stakes will be much higher. That forum will take place in mid-January in Iowa, a few weeks ahead of the caucuses that start the nominating process. By the end of February there will be three more debates and three more contests.
Democratic voters have shown a reluctance to make firm commitments to one or another of the candidates, but decision time is approaching quickly. Those first contests could winnow the field to a relatively few candidates "" or signal a long war and the possible emergence of someone who wasn't on the stage in Los Angeles, namely Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York.
The last debate of 2019 offered a preview of what comes next as each of the Democratic candidates tries to convince their voters they are singularly equipped to lead the party to victory against Trump.

Trump seeks to let states, others bring in medicines from Canada
The Trump administration laid out a plan Wednesday to fulfill the president's long-standing vow to lower prescription drug prices by allowing states, drug wholesalers and pharmacies to import some cheaper drugs from Canada. But officials could not say when the plan might go into effect, and many questions about its possible scope remain unanswered.
Curbing high drug prices has been a top priority for President Trump ahead of the 2020 election, and he demanded advisers pursue options long opposed by many Republicans, including importing cheaper drugs from other countries and using some overseas prices as a benchmark for some drugs in Medicare. While the president had sought to give voters access to cheaper drugs before the election, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters that while the administration is 'moving as quickly as we possibly can,' it still needs to collect public input and that he could not predict the timetable for the plan's implementation.
Azar announced the policy in an appearance Wednesday with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), a Trump ally, who has sought federal approval to allow the state to import Canadian drugs for the state Medicaid program. Trump pushed his advisers to speed things up as he woos voters in Florida, a battleground state that played a key role in his 2016 win.
'For the first time in history, HHS and FDA are open to importation as a means to lower drug prices,' Azar said on the call with reporters, referring to the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Food and Drug Administration. 'No president in history has had an FDA willing to open the door to safe importation of drugs from Canada.'
Azar said he could not predict possible cost savings because he didn't know how many states might come forward with plans or what would be in them. Several states have shown interest in importing drugs from Canada.
It also remains unclear whether the plan will survive expected legal challenges from the pharmaceutical industry and whether it will be possible to import significant quantities of drugs from Canada. The Canadian government has fiercely pushed back against importation proposals, warning that the drug supply for Canada's 37-million residents cannot possibly fulfill the demands of the much larger U.S. market and that allowing importation would cause severe drug shortages for Canadians.
Analysts said it could be years before any drugs are actually imported from Canada "" if they ever are "" given myriad regulatory and legal requirements involved in finalizing and implementing the plan.
'If you put Canadian drugs on a dog sled and pointed it in the direction of Florida, the dogs would arrive long before any drugs through this regulatory proposal,' said Chris Meekins, a former HHS official who is now a research analyst at Raymond James, a financial services firm.
Trump's political foes said the initiative does not go far enough. 'Once again, the Trump White House is tiptoeing around Big Pharma with a spectacularly pinched and convoluted proposal that excludes insulin and has no actual implementation date,' Henry Connelly, a spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), said in a statement. He said the Republican-controlled Senate should take up the House-passed bill to lower drug prices.
The administration's announcement comes as Congress failed to pass bipartisan drug pricing legislation, backed by the White House, in a year-end spending bill, and as infighting and policy disputes have thwarted much of the administration's efforts to lower drug prices. Democrats already have begun rolling out ads about their own efforts to lower drug prices with House legislation that would allow Medicare to negotiate the prices of up to 250 drugs each year, and are expected to attack Republicans and the White House for failing to work with them to pass that legislation. Several presidential candidates, including vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), also support importation.
The administration's newly issued blueprint would provide two pathways to allow for the importation of drugs. The first, released as a proposed rule, would enable states, along with wholesalers and pharmacies, to develop programs to purchase certain brand-name prescription drugs from Canada, where they are cheaper because a federal body sets a price ceiling for patented drugs. Those plans would require federal approval.
Under this option, states could not import more complex "" and often more expensive "" medications, such as biologic or intravenous drugs, products injected in the spinal column or eye, or controlled substances. Any medications that are imported also must be approved by Canadian regulators and meet all U.S. standards, undergo testing in the United States to ensure authenticity and demonstrate they will result in significant cost savings.
The second pathway, issued as draft 'guidance' that is likely to go into effect sooner, would allow drug manufacturers to import to the United States cheaper versions of their medications from any country under certain conditions. Many experts doubt most pharmaceutical companies would choose to do so.
Just last year, Azar dismissed the idea of importation as a 'gimmick' because he said it would be difficult to ensure counterfeit drugs from other countries are not routed through Canada. But he said Tuesday that the administration's plan would not 'put patients or our drug supply chain at risk.'
In the 2003 law that created a Medicare drug benefit, Congress allowed the importation of limited types of drugs from Canada if the HHS secretary certified it would pose no safety risks and resulted in significant cost savings. No HHS secretary has ever made such a certification.
The pharmaceutical industry has fiercely pushed back against the administration's importation proposal. In July, it called the plan a 'scheme' with 'no way to guarantee the safety of drugs that come into the country from outside the United States' gold-standard supply chain.'

Joe Biden
Thirteen hours before the former vice president walked onto the debate stage, an interview with his son aired in which Hunter Biden said it was poor judgment - but not improper - for him to take a job with a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father was shepherding U.S. policy there. 
Biden reiterated that he had done nothing wrong, a point that other candidates didn't object to. 
""My son did nothing wrong,"" Biden said in answer to the second question he was asked during Tuesday's debate. ""I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine. . . . My son's statement speaks for itself. What I think is important is that we focus on why it's so important to remove [President Trump] from office."" 
Bernie Sanders
The debate is the Vermont senator's biggest event since suffering a heart attack two weeks ago in Las Vegas. The oldest candidate in the field entered Tuesday's debate needing to show that his campaign continues unabated and to dispel worries that he is too old to handle the strenuous job of commander in chief. 
He joked about his health (""I'm healthy. I'm feeling great"") and said he would be mounting a ""vigorous campaign all over this country,"" but he focused more on other people's health care.
""I get a little bit tired - I must say - of people defending a system which is dysfunctional, which is cruel, which has 87 million uninsured, 30,000 people dying every single year, 500,000 people going bankrupt for one reason: They came down with cancer,"" he said. ""I will tell you what the issue is here. The issue is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the health-care industry, which made 100 billion dollars in profit, whether we have the guts to stand up to the corrupt price-fixing pharmaceutical industry.""
Kamala D. Harris
The California senator's previous debate attack on Biden did little to stop her slide in the polls. She's recently defended the former vice president when he was attacked by President Trump.
On Tuesday she repeatedly went after Trump on domestic and foreign policy, saying he had ""sold out"" U.S. workers and U.S. allies.
""What has happened in Syria is yet again Donald Trump selling folks out, and in this case he sold out the Kurds, who . . . fought with us and thousands died in our fight against [the Islamic State],"" she said. 
""And let's be clear what Donald Trump has done . . . is basically giving 10,000 ISIS fighters a get-out-of-jail-free card. . . . This is a crisis of Donald Trump's making, and it is on a long list of crises of Donald Trump's making, and that's why dude gotta go.""
Cory Booker
Booker, the former mayor of Newark and a current senator from New Jersey, has had several buzzworthy debate moments, but they have yet to translate into a bump in polling and fundraising. His campaign recently announced that if he didn't receive $1.7 million in donations, he wouldn't have enough to go on. 
On Tuesday, he repeatedly insisted that Democratic candidates' attacks on each other were playing into
the president's hands. 
""We've got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president, and how we talk about each other in this debate actually really matters,"" he said. ""I've had the privilege of working with or being friends with everybody on this stage, and tearing each other down because we have a different plan to me is unacceptable."" 
Tom Steyer
Steyer is on the debate stage for the first time. He's also a billionaire running against candidates who have vilified the richest Americans. Elizabeth Warren's rallies frequently feature people chanting ""two cents,"" in support of her plan for wealth tax on people worth more than $50 million.
When asked about other candidates' war on billionaires, he said that the U.S. economy is unfairly weighted in favor of corporations. 
""I was one of the first people on this stage to propose a wealth tax,"" he said. ""I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations.""
Tulsi Gabbard
The first headline for Tulsi Gabbard from Tuesday's debate: She showed up. Just days ago, the four-term Hawaii congresswoman threatened a boycott of the debate in protest of what she called the ""rigging"" of the election by the Democratic National Committee and the corporate media. But she abruptly shifted course with no explanation. 
On Tuesday, Gabbard, a veteran who has won support from the far right and the far left for her criticism of U.S. military involvement abroad, was asked about Trump's decision to withdraw American troops from Syria. ""Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hands, but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties,"" Gabbard replied.
Elizabeth Warren
With a narrow lead over Biden in many recent primary polls, Warren for the first time came under sustained attack from her rivals, including Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Harris, Amy Klobuchar and even Beto O'Rourke, who challenged the Massachusetts senator on whether she has been straight with Americans about the costs of her many plans and whether her proposals could actually be passed into law.
Warren pushed back, arguing that she had dreamed big before and cited her role in the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - suggesting that the agency had been created despite skepticism from members of the Obama administration. Biden immediately took offense, telling Warren he had worked to win support in the Senate. But the senator was unmoved.
""I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law,"" Warren replied.
Pete Buttigieg
The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., has raised more than $51 million since the beginning of the year. And he boasts one of the largest early state ground operations - including in Iowa, where he regularly draws some of the largest crowds in the field. But Buttigieg, who would be the first openly gay president in U.S. history, has struggled to break out from the middle of the pack. 
On Tuesday, Buttigieg was noticeably more aggressive than past debates, repeatedly challenging Warren on a litany of issues, including the cost of her Medicare-for-all plan. He accused her of promoting ""infinite partisan combat.""
""I don't understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans, kicking 150 million Americans off of their insurance in four short years,"" Buttigieg told Warren.

Andrew Yang
Once viewed as the longest of long shot candidates, Yang, a former lawyer and entrepreneur, has attracted large crowds and an intense online following that has helped him outlast better-known Democrats in the race. Last quarter, he raised $10 million, eclipsing many of his rivals. 
But Yang, who has made his pitch for a $1,000-a-month universal basic income the signature policy proposal of his campaign, is still trying to be taken more seriously. After several debates, where Yang seemed to vanish, he was front and center Tuesday during debates over his universal basic income pitch and the impact of automation on job loss.
While he joined other Democrats in support of impeachment, Yang cautioned the party ""shouldn't have any illusions that impeaching Donald Trump will, one, be successful or, two, erase the problems that got him elected in 2016.""
Beto O'Rourke
The former Texas congressman entered Tuesday's debate with a degree of urgency, warning supporters ahead of time that unless he turns things around, he might not make the cut for the November debate in Atlanta.
After making an early splash in the race, O'Rourke has struggled since, retooling his message to embrace increasingly liberal positions on issues like gun control. On Tuesday, he defended his proposed mandatory buyback of AR-15s and AK-47s, though he struggled to explain how he would enforce it.
O'Rourke called out Buttigieg, who has publicly criticized O'Rourke's gun plan as a ""shiny object"" that has no chance of passing. 
Buttigieg responded: ""I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.""
Amy Klobuchar
Klobuchar has not yet qualified for the November debate, so she went into Tuesday fighting to stay in the race. Her strategy has focused on the fact that she's from a Midwestern state that neighbors Iowa. 
On Tuesday, she repeatedly went after Warren. Early on, she said the Massachusetts senator wasn't being transparent about how much more taxpayers would have to pay for her Medicare-for-all plan. 
""At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up, and I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice,"" she said. 
Julián Castro
Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio and secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development under President Barack Obama, has struggled to stand out in this year's historically large field of candidates. And once again, Castro struggled to get speaking time Tuesday in what could be his last appearance on the national debate stage. At one point, Castro, the only Latino candidate in the race, criticized Trump's decision to withdraw American troops from Syria. ""Think about how absurd it is that this president is caging kids on the border and effectively letting ISIS prisoners run free,"" he said.

But he also sought todispel concerns about party's presidential slate
Former president Barack Obama on Friday urged Democrats running for the White House not to lurch too far left in their pursuit of the nomination, while at the same time seeking to quell concerns in the party about its 2020 hopefuls and the messy primary season to come.
The comments "" made in Washington at a meeting of the Democracy Alliance, a powerful network of liberal donors "" marked some of Obama's most pointed words yet about a fluid primary race in which he is not picking sides. They echoed previous comments in which he warned about the dangers of pursuing purity and rigidity in politics. 
'This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement,' Obama said. 'They like seeing things improved. But the average American doesn't think that we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it's important for us not to lose sight of that.'
Obama did not name any candidates. But some Democrats associate the characteristics he described with Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), staunch liberal candidates advocating sweeping change who are running near the top of the polls. 
Beyond those two candidates, the contest has often been dominated by a discussion of ideas that were long seen as untenable, even in Democratic circles. Candidates have called for mandatory buybacks of certain firearms, decriminalizing border crossings and forgiving most or all student debt. In some cases, the proposals have come at a cost of tens of trillions of dollars.
 However, Obama also warned the candidates against simply standing pat and campaigning on his accomplishments. Instead, he argued, they should try to 'push past' them with new ideas. He pointed to his signature health-care law, which has been a focal point in the contest, as a prime example, calling it a 'really good starter home.'
Obama's vice president, Joe Biden, has campaigned aggressively on expanding the Affordable Care Act with an optional public insurance program, as has South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, another top candidate.
That has put them at odds with Warren and Sanders, who favor implementing a new Medicare-for-all system that would insure everyone through the government. 
Obama did not indicate a preference Friday. 
The former president seemed to be urging a balance between striving for bold new ideas and being in touch with voters' concerns. While it is the role of activists to push for dramatic change, Obama said, candidates should aim to win elections. 
'My point is that even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds or the activist wing of our party,' he said. 
The 44th president has been careful about commenting publicly about the contest. He has not spoken about it often, even as he has frequently met with and counseled the candidates in private over the past couple of years.
He said he has advised all of them to ask themselves the same basic questions: Why me? How will this impact my loved ones? And can I win?
The last question is one that has increasingly given Democratic donors anxiety as they assess the field. This week, it grew with the addition of former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, a staunch Obama ally who entered the race saying that neither the path trod by Biden nor Sanders and Warren 'seizes the moment' in a way that insures a defeat for Trump. Meanwhile, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg also has taken steps toward running. 
The 11th-hour moves reflect a primary contest unsettled by the fears of many Democrats worried that Trump will seize a second term. Obama urged them to not to be fretful.
'For those who get stressed about robust primaries, I just have to remind you that I had a very robust primary,' he said, prompting laughter in the audience. He reminded those in attendance of his grueling 2008 battle with Hillary Clinton. 
'We have a field of very accomplished, very serious and passionate and smart people who have a history of public service,' Obama said. 'And whoever emerges from the primary process, I will work my tail off to make sure they are the next president.' 
Even as he remains neutral in the primaries, Obama is stepping deeper into the campaign. Next week, he will appear at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in Silicon Valley. 
The president spoke Friday in what was billed as a 'fireside chat' with Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia and a rising star in the party. 
As he concluded the roughly 45-minute discussion, Obama offered a final word of advice for the party's White House hopefuls. 
'We have the better argument,' Obama said. 'We can't be arrogant about it. We can't take for granted that somehow people, just, you know, the scales will fall from their eyes at some point.'

Historic candidacies open a conversation on aging on the public stage

Can we talk about Joe Biden's face? And Bernie Sanders's heart attack? And Elizabeth Warren's honey blond hair? And Donald Trump's unnatural hue?
Can we talk about the senior citizens running for president?
Trump and three leading Democratic challengers are all septuagenarians, and there's not enough hair dye or spray tan in the world to cover up that fact. They may be smart; they may be experienced, but - sorry, boomers - 70 is not the new 50.
The median age for presidents at the time of their inauguration is 55; Trump was the oldest when sworn in at age 70; Reagan was 69 and George Washington just 57.
That makes the advanced age of the top 2020 presidential candidates historic: If elected, Warren would be 71 at her inauguration. Biden would be 78, Sanders 79, and Trump would begin a second term at age 74.
How much of this is about chronological age and how much is the perception of age? Psychologists say it's really about first impressions, a quick and often subconscious evaluation of a candidate's health, strength and competence.
Politicians can't lie about when they were born, but they can appear younger: Bounding onstage, covering gray hair, plumping wrinkles and sagging jowls with Botox. It's not about vanity; it's about looking fit and energetic. Yes, it's superficial and, yes, it makes a difference.
But there's more to this numbers game.
""If I were just 80 years old, if I was 15 years younger, I don't believe I could undertake the duties I experienced when I was president,"" former president Jimmy Carter, 95, said in September.
Trump says Carter was ""referring to Biden."" ""I just feel like a young man,"" the current president said in April. ""I'm so young. I can't believe it. I'm the youngest person. I'm a young, vibrant man.""
Naturally, the topic came up at the Democratic debate last month: Biden cited his age and experience as a good thing, then promised to release his medical records. Sanders, asked about his recent heart attack, said he would mount a ""vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people."" Warren said she would ""outwork, out-organize, and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with.""
None of them really went to the heart of the question: Are these people too old for the job?
Hiding the gray
Until the 1950s, hair color was the quickest way to determine someone's age; most people had a head of silver hair by the time they were 60. Then in 1956, Clairol introduced an at-home coloring process that allowed Grandma to be a blonde, a redhead or simply claim ""good genes."" And Grecian Formula for men promised to imperceptibly fade away the gray. Not that they ever admitted it, but politicians had a new tool in their bag of tricks.
Ronald Reagan insisted his glossy locks were naturally brown and claimed that reporters had purloined clippings from his barber's floor to prove him wrong. Do or dye? Nancy Reagan's unofficial biographer, Kitty Kelley, finally uncovered the big secret: The first lady's hairstylist had been secretly coloring the president's gray roots for more than 20 years.
A reporter for Time magazine was dispatched in 1995 to ask presidential candidate Bob Dole one question: Did the 72-year-old dye his hair? Dole admitted he put ""a little stuff"" to fend off the gray, but insisted he did not color his eyebrows. Oh, and he worked hard on his tan for a healthy bronze glow.
The question has become a leitmotif of presidential politics, and the answer is almost always no. The White House will not say whether Trump dyes his hair, despite the fact it is not a color found in nature. (Mike Pence, on the other hand, was rocking gray in his 30s.)
If gray hair is a problem for men, it is rarely found on female candidates. Warren aged from a brunette to a honey blonde. (Her campaign did not respond to a request for comment.) Nancy Pelosi, 79, is a light brunette with nary a stray gray. None of this is surprising: More than two-thirds of American women use some form of hair coloring.
""There's a reason why 40, 50 and 60 don't look the way they used to, and it's not because of feminism, or better living through exercise,"" Nora Ephron once wrote. ""It's because of hair dye."" Covering the gray, she argued, allows middle-aged and older women to be seen as powerful professionals, not grandmas.
It takes a politician like Sanders, who has branded himself as an bombastic iconoclast, to sport an unruly head of white hair. Or China's President Xi Jinping, who made headlines in spring for allowing streaks of gray to appear, breaking with the customary jet black hair worn by the nation's leaders dating back to Mao Zedong, according to CNN. Xi, who is protected by a new constitutional amendment that allows him to rule for life, now has the freedom - at age 66 - to age publicly.
Tucks, teeth and treatments
Shortly before the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln grew a beard after receiving a letter from 11-year-old Grace Bedell: ""If you let your whiskers grow I will try and get [my brothers] to vote for you, you would look a great deal better for your face is so thin.""
Lincoln replied that he had never worn whiskers: ""Do you not think people would call it a silly affectation if I were to begin it now?"" But soon, he had the now iconic beard.
Today's politicians have hundreds of cosmetic enhancements at their fingertips: teeth whiteners, tanning beds, nips, tucks, laser treatments and fillers. The goal is not necessarily to look young; the object is to appear refreshed. The best work (Pelosi's, if any of the expert speculation is correct) is the medical equivalent of a really good vacation.
For many voters, looking old and tired translates to being old: old-fashioned, old boys club, old ideas. Aging faces have less fat, creating unflattering shadows that make people look exhausted or angry - especially on a high-definition television, where the lights are harsh and unforgiving.
""Optimal treatments for those who are frequently on television focus on skin quality,"" says Washington dermatologist Noelle Sherber. ""Using state-of-the-art technologies - lasers with no downtime - one can firm the skin and even out its texture and tone in a way that presents as youthful good health rather than a procedural fix.""
She has a number of patients - elected officials, CEOs and others in the public eye - who start ""prejuvenation"" treatments in their 30s and 40s.
""So that by the time they reach their 70s,"" she says, ""they look like they're still in their 50s.""
So, let's talk: People have been gossiping about Biden's hair for three decades, with much discussion of hair plugs and enhancements for the follicly challenged. More recently, the attention has shifted to his dazzling, larger-than-life smile and his eyes, which look . . . different. (The Biden campaign did not respond to a request for comment.)
""We all know these people are old,"" wrote Bonnie Kristian in the Week. ""Surely, they know we know they're old. So why not own it?"" Instead, she says, Biden has ""created a bizarre simulacrum of endless - well, not youth, but certainly a long gone upper middle age. The combined effect of the tan, the teeth, the hair, and maybe Botox and fillers, if not a facelift, is on the verge of unsettling.""

Hypothetically, Biden is in rarefied company with former secretary of state John Kerry (whose face went through a rather startling transformation a few years back), Vladimir Putin and a growing number of CEOs. Smoothing a jawline, softening crow's feet, shaving even five years off can make a significant difference.
For the most part, Trump has escaped similar scrutiny about his age, although his hair is a subject of ongoing fascination: His longtime personal doctor said Trump takes Propecia to address male pattern baldness, and author Michael Wolff wrote that Ivanka Trump teases her father about his hair dye and how he styles his signature comb-over.
Putting hair aside, many see the president's two-hour rallies as proof of his health, regardless of his seemingly spray-on tan (an orange hue that his critics use to launch a thousand memes) or his penchant for junk food. His age rarely makes headlines because so many people have so many other reasons to question his fitness for the job.
""Trump doesn't break one or two rules - Trump breaks every rule,"" says Republican strategist Doug Heye. ""That's one of the things that allows him to get away with things that no one else could. If Biden, Bernie or Warren came out with a statement from their doctor that said, 'This is the most fit person in the history of civilization' they'd get filleted for it. And sure, people made fun of Trump, but then we moved on to the next thing about Trump.""
Energy on display
Last month, Warren bounced onstage at a South Carolina rally, jumping around like a person decades younger. She gives the impression that she is better equipped for the rigors of the Oval Office than many of her rivals.
""Nobody really thinks of Elizabeth Warren as old and it helps that she looks great,"" says Heye. ""And she takes 5,000 pictures a day, which also is a very smart kind of tool for her at the grass-roots level. You can't call that 'low energy.' ""
It's different for male candidates, he says. ""Trump has tried to play on this on 'Sleepy Joe' or 'Low-Energy Jeb' - even though Jeb wasn't 70 - to demonstrate strength. It can be a precarious situation.""
Until recently, Sanders was the embodiment of the feisty, ""Get off my lawn"" guy ready to take on the world. But the heart attack put his advanced years into stark relief, and it's become an issue for his campaign.
Sanders insists his age is an asset. ""I've been criticized for being old. I plead guilty. I am old. But there are advantages to being old,"" he said last month. ""Having a long record gives people the understanding that these ideas that I am talking about - they are in my guts. They are in my heart,"" He did not directly address his health.
Biden was America's gaffe-prone but lovable uncle/vice president in Ray-Bans, which played in his favor until he decided to run for president a third time. Now his meandering turns of phrase, which are often weird or outdated, are open to interpretation.
Charming or alarming? Depends who you ask.
""I think it's important to remember that the electorate is dominated by people over the age of 50: The people with the highest voting propensity and therefore the people who punch above their weight are retirees,"" says Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""They're in a unique position to ask a very honest question: 'If I were trying to do the job of a president, a very demanding job, would I be able to do it? Would I be able to keep it up day in, day out, for four years?'""
In 1984, Reagan lost the first presidential debate against Walter Mondale: His closing was muddled, confused. Was the 73-year-old president too old for a second term?
""Everybody understood that the second debate was make-or-break for that issue,"" says Galston, who was Mondale's policy director for the campaign. That's when Reagan delivered the now classic line: ""I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.""
The audience burst out laughing, including Mondale. But during Reagan's second term, ""something was amiss"" in terms of his memory and mental acuity, according to his son Ron. Reagan was officially diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1994, almost six years after he left office.
Deep breath. The 2020 election is a year away, a lifetime in politics. Maybe none of these people will be their party's nominee for president.
Maybe we'll be asking instead: Are these young politicians too naive and inexperienced to be president?

Elizabeth Warren
As in past debates, early attention on Warren focused on her commitment to Medicare-for-all. Facing increased pressure in recent weeks, the senator from Massachusetts released a financing plan for her health-care proposal that included some tax increases on large corporations and the very wealthy, then a 'transition' plan that critics "" especially Bernie Sanders supporters "" said amounted to backing away from Medicare-for-all.
There were some oblique criticisms of the feasibility of Warren's plans, but for the most part, the moderators moved on quickly from health care. Perhaps more notable was the moment that didn't happen: Sanders refrained from outright attacking Warren on Medicare-for-all, maintaining the united liberal front the two have put forth, at least onstage, through one more debate.
For the rest of the debate, Warren emphasized themes of rooting out corruption and unity "" at one point outlining a national service plan "" perhaps in anticipation that she would be criticized again for being too polarizing to win a general election.
'We want to build an America that works for the people, not just one that works for rich folks,' she said. 

Pete Buttigieg
Having surged in Iowa, risen in New Hampshire and stagnated in South Carolina, Buttigieg entered this debate as the likely focus of criticism from other candidates "" but most of his opponents avoided direct attacks on the mayor, instead using them as opportunities to make broader points.
When Amy Klobuchar was asked if she thought Buttigieg benefited from male privilege, she demurred and said she thought he was qualified "" but that women were held to a higher standard. Even Kamala D. Harris passed up on a chance to knock Buttigieg for his low support among black voters, and instead talked generally about how Democratic candidates have long taken for granted constituents who have been the 'backbone' of the party.
Buttigieg, meanwhile, also eased off on the aggressive attacks he made in the last debate. Instead, he used his talking time to cast himself as a Washington outsider from a racially diverse city.
'There's over 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and look where we are as a country,' he said.

Amy Klobuchar
The two-term senator from Minnesota recently threw shade at Buttigieg, suggesting a female candidate with his level of experience would never make it to the debate stage. Asked about the comment, Klobuchar praised Buttigieg but stood by her statement. 'Women are held to a higher standard. Otherwise, we could play a game called 'Name Your Favorite Woman President,' which we can't do because it has been all men,' Klobuchar said. 

Tulsi Gabbard
The congresswoman from Hawaii seemed to be galvanized in recent weeks after calling Hillary Clinton the 'personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party,' remarks she was asked about onstage. Gabbard, who has since regularly been bashing Clinton and 'the establishment' in fundraising emails and on Fox News, continued her criticism of her own party.
'Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by and for the people,' Gabbard said.
Gabbard later got roundly rebuffed by both Harris and Buttigieg for meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Buttigieg said he questioned her judgment that she would sit down 'with a murderous dictator like that.'
As she had in the past, Gabbard stood by her decision.
'I will meet with and do what is necessary' to end regime-change wars, she said.

Cory Booker
Booker, the former Newark mayor who has campaigned on a message of 'radical love' and largely avoided going negative in past debates, seized on a moment early on to spar (albeit sunnily) with Warren, calling her proposed wealth tax on the ultrawealthy 'cumbersome' and 'hard to evaluate.'
Several times, Booker also differentiated himself from Buttigieg in subtle ways, noting he was 'mayor of the largest city in my state,' a clear knock on South Bend, the fourth-largest city in Indiana.
'I happen to be the other Rhodes Scholar mayor on this stage,' Booker added.
Later, Booker expounded on the importance of nominating a candidate who has an authentic connection with black voters. He also zinged Joe Biden for saying recently he didn't think marijuana should be legalized.
'No one on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African American voters.'
'I thought you might have been high when you said it!' Booker told the former vice president, only half jokingly. 'Marijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people. The war on drugs has been a war on black and brown people.'
Joe Biden
After lackluster debate performances and a recent Iowa poll that suggested his campaign is losing ground there, the former vice president spent Wednesday's debate emphasizing again and again the issue of electability. He argued that he's the best positioned of anyone in the field to defeat President Trump and to help Democrats retain control of the U.S. House and win back the Senate.
'You have to ask yourself up here, who is most likely to be able to win the nomination in the first place?' Biden said. 'You have to win the presidency in the first place.'
 Biden also pointed to his decades of foreign policy experience, arguing that Democrats have to nominate someone who is ready to go on 'day one' to mend foreign relationships strained in the era of Trump. 'I know every world leader. They know me,' Biden said.
He notably stumbled when touting his popularity among black voters, saying he had the support of 'the only African American woman who had ever been elected to the United States Senate' "" prompting an incredulous Harris to interject: 'No. That's not true. The other one is here!'

Bernie Sanders
The senator from Vermont was asked about former president Barack Obama's recent assessment that voters don't want to 'tear down the system and remake it' "" a comment widely interpreted as a swipe at Medicare-for-all. Sanders was careful not to criticize Obama, but made clear that he disagreed with him. 'He's right. We don't have to tear down the system, but we do have to do what the American people want. And the American people understand today that the current health-care system is not only cruel, it is dysfunctional,' Sanders said. 'If you think back to FDR and if you think back to JFK and Harry Truman and Barack Obama, as a matter of fact, people have been talking about health care for all. Well, you know what? I think now is the time.'
At one point, Sanders defended the Democrats on impeachment, suggesting the party can 'can walk and chew gum at the same time.' 'We can deal with Trump's corruption, but we also have to stand up for the working families of this country,' he said. 'We can do it all when we rally the American people in the cause of justice.'

Kamala D. Harris
The senator from California has steadily lost ground in the polls since her clash with Biden over issues of race at the first debate in June. Seeking to regain momentum, she released an ad just before Wednesday's debate touting her record as a prosecutor and presenting herself as the opposite of Trump 'in every possible way.' And onstage, she repeatedly emphasized her ability to appeal to and unite different parts of the Democratic Party, including 'overlooked' constituencies such as women of color. 'We've got to re-create the Obama coalition to win. And that means women. That's people of color. That's our LGBTQ community. That's working people. That's our labor unions,' she said. 'That is how we are going to win this election.'

Andrew Yang
A political newcomer with an intense online following, Yang regularly attracts some of the largest crowds in the race, support that has helped him outlast several better-known Democrats and kept him on the debate stage. Still, Yang has struggled to be taken seriously, even as other candidates in the race, such as Biden, have recently seized upon some of the issues he's raised, including the impact of automation on job loss in small-town America. At one point, Yang was asked what he would say in his first phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, if elected. 'First, I'd say, 'I'm sorry I beat your guy,'-' Yang said. 'Second, I would say, 'The days of meddling in American elections are over and we will take any undermining of our democratic processes as an act of hostility and aggression.' The American people would back me on this. We know that they've found an underbelly and they've been clawing at it, and it's made it so that we can't even trust our own democracy.'

Tom Steyer
This was the billionaire candidate's second debate appearance, and he used much of his speaking time to reintroduce himself to the electorate. Steyer originally launched his campaign on the strength of his push for Trump's impeachment, but Wednesday tried to rebrand his candidacy as one centered on 'structural change' in Washington. He claimed that he was the only person onstage who would talk about term limits and said that climate change was his 'number-one priority.'

Emails show industry effort to deter support for 
big health-care changes
Lobbyists either helped draft or made extensive revisions to opinion columns published by three state lawmakers in a way that suggested Medicare-for-all and other government involvement in health care posed dangers, according to emails obtained by The Washington Post.
Montana state Rep. Kathy Kelker (D) and Sen. Jen Gross (D) acknowledged in interviews that editorials they published separately about the single-payer health proposal included language provided by John MacDonald, a lobbyist and consultant in the state who disclosed in private emails that he worked for an unnamed client.
Gross said MacDonald contacted her on behalf of the Partnership for America's Health Care Future, a multimillion-dollar industry group founded in 2018 and funded by hospitals, private insurers, drug companies and other private health-care firms.
Additionally, an aide to Ohio state Sen. Stephen A. Huffman (R) confirmed in a brief interview that the lawmaker's op-ed criticizing Medicare-for-all was written with the help of Kathleen DeLand, an Ohio-based lobbyist.
None of the lawmakers' columns discloses that they were written with the help of a lobbyist.

The documents were provided to The Post by the nonprofit advocacy group Medicare for All Now, which supports the single-payer system. The group obtained the documents through Freedom of Information Act requests.
The revelation comes amid a fierce debate among Democrats nationwide about the best way to address health-care concerns. Two candidates, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (Vt.), have proposed a massive redesign of the health-care system that would have all Americans covered by a single government health insurer.
Health care remains a top issue for many voters, and industry groups and moderate politicians have warned that the ideas pursued by Warren and Sanders could be viewed as too extreme and lead Democrats to lose in the 2020 election. But the ideas are also very popular among Americans.
The emails offer a glimpse into the industry mobilization against both single-payer and a 'public option,' a government-run insurer that would compete with private plans. A change could redirect trillions of dollars in spending, with insurers, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies all directly affected.
The Partnership for America's Health Care Future has spent more than $1 million on television advertisements since August, warning against Medicare-for-all and other changes to the health-care system, according to Advertising Analytics, a firm that tracks TV spending. 
Neither of the consultants who helped write the op-eds would confirm or deny whether they had been hired by the Partnership for America's Health Care Future.
MacDonald, asked whether he works for the organization, responded over the phone by saying: 'Not directly. . . . I probably need to talk to some other folks before I provide any details to you and see if I can have somebody call you back.' MacDonald later declined to provide more information about his clients.
DeLand's emails to the Ohio lawmaker's staff include the acronym for the group in the subject line: 'PAHCF op-ed - OH - Huffman[3]. docx.' DeLand did not respond to requests for comment.
A spokesman for the Partnership for America's Health Care Future declined to say whether the group had hired MacDonald or DeLand. 
'It's no surprise that elected officials on both sides of the aisle, and many other voices throughout the nation, are expressing serious concerns about these one-size-fits-all proposals' such as Medicare-for-all, said Lauren Crawford Shaver, the group's executive director.
Single-payer supporters say the lobbyists' role in crafting the op-eds bolsters their argument that their opponents are parroting talking points from industry groups that profit off the current health-care system.
'These secret emails blow open what I saw firsthand and revealed as a health insurance whistleblower: These companies and their lobbyists will stoop to whatever it takes, no matter how grotesque, to deny people the lifesaving coverage they need,' said Wendell Potter, a former health insurance executive who is now president of Business for Medicare for All. 


The emails appear to show extensive outside involvement in the Montana lawmakers' op-eds. In a Microsoft Word document, MacDonald removed three paragraphs from a draft of Kelker's op-ed that pointed out that the United States 'clearly spends significantly more on health care per capita than other developed nations.' He also deleted a table from the lawmaker's original draft showing that the United States has higher health-care spending per capita than France, Germany, Norway and Switzerland.
The columns were published this summer in the Missoulian and the Billings Gazette.
'I know most newspapers are going to have trouble formatting the graphic you provided and will likely ask us to hold off on that,' MacDonald told Kelker in a June 12 email. 'The client had trepidations that it might also come across to the 'less-discerning' reader that because foreign single-payer markets cost patients less, they are superior.'
Instead, MacDonald wrote in the draft he sent back to Kelker that 'extreme ends of the political spectrum' are offering health-care proposals while 'what most Montanans and Americans would prefer lies somewhere in the middle.' In his revisions, MacDonald also added a sentence that said, 'Calls for a more government-controlled healthcare system are misguided as well.'
In an interview, Kelker said it is common for state legislators to publish under their name op-eds that they did not write. 'That's pretty normal,' she said. 'Actually, most of the time, for legislators, at least in Montana, [they] are written by someone else. You know, a helper-person, not necessarily a lobbyist. I normally write all of the text for my op-eds.'

Gross, who acknowledged writing less than half of her op-ed, said that when she worked at Planned Parenthood, she frequently provided 'templates' for young people who needed help drafting statements, adding that this practice occurs elsewhere, as well. Gross also said she listened to MacDonald's description of the Partnership for America's Health Care Future and supported the group's message.






An aide to Huffman, the Ohio state senator, confirmed that his office worked with the consultant on Huffman's op-ed criticizing Medicare-for-all as 'socialized medicine' and 'not a workable solution.' Asked whether that consultant had been hired by the Partnership for America's Health Care Future, the aide responded, 'I believe so.' Huffman's office declined additional requests for comment.
John Fortney, a spokesman for the Ohio Senate Majority Caucus, later said in a statement: 'The legislative process is open to input from everyone, including experts from [the] medical community. Senator Huffman is an emergency room doctor and understands the serious problems and affordability of the left's misguided single payer agenda.'

President Trump, whose reelection campaign is counting on unstinting support from white evangelicals, mounted a fierce attack Friday against a prominent Christian magazine that harshly criticized his behavior, repudiated his actions toward Ukraine and said he should be removed from office.
Trump's evangelical supporters rushed to defend him, attempting to portray Christianity Today, which was founded by late famed evangelist the Rev. Billy Graham, as an outlier and not representative of the voters that comprise their movement.
But the magazine's unsparing Thursday editorial, which said Trump has a 'grossly immoral character' and should be removed out of 'loyalty to the creator of the Ten Commandments,' clearly rattled the White House and the evangelical leaders who have tied themselves closely to the president.
Trump derided it as a 'far left magazine . . . which has been doing poorly' in a tweet Friday morning, although the magazine is considered far from liberal. He later took to Twitter to tout his record on issues important to the Christian right.
'The fact is, no President has ever done what I have done for Evangelicals, or religion itself!' he wrote.
Beneath the president's angry outbursts lies a fear that, ahead of the 2020 election, Trump could lose some evangelical supporters, who as a group have remained durably bonded to him despite his payments to an adult-film star after allegations of an affair; attacks on war heroes, congressional widows and a teenage climate activist; boasts of sexual assault caught on tape; and the regular use of profanity at rallies from behind the presidential lectern. 
Even a slight drop in support among these voters could be detrimental to the president's reelection hopes, particularly in swing states. An NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist poll from earlier this month found 75-percent of white evangelicals approved of Trump, compared with 42-percent of Americans overall. Evangelicals surged to the polls in key battleground states in 2016 to vote for Trump "" and campaign efforts are already underway to make sure they return en masse in 2020.
But Trump's presidency has reflected a sharp divide among evangelicals across generational and racial lines, especially since many younger evangelicals and evangelicals of color are less likely to support the president on issues like immigration.
Among pastors, political strategists and even the author of the magazine piece, Mark Galli, there was little belief the editorial would be a seminal moment of revolt against the president.
Several White House officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private deliberations, said they believed Trump was bringing too much attention to the editorial in a magazine that is largely read by elite pastors and, according to its publisher, has a paid circulation of 90,000. They said that in their view, he was probably overreacting to the criticism after a long week in which he became the third president in U.S. history to be impeached.
Trump officials were still under pressure to act. The Trump campaign emailed out a statement from Cissie Graham Lynch, Billy Graham's granddaughter, praising the president. It later announced it is launching 'Evangelicals for Trump' at an event in Miami on Jan. 3. 
While the event was already in the works, it was announced Friday to appease the president, who also wants evangelical leaders to come to the White House in January, according to one White House official.
'He's putting a lot of pressure on people because he thinks this is a big deal,' the official said. 
Trump has often weathered incidents that could potentially hurt him with evangelical voters. After the Access Hollywood tape in which Trump bragged about assaulting women came out in late 2016, Paul Djupe, a political scientist at Denison University who studies religion and politics, did an online poll of about 1,000 Christians and found there was no movement in their attitudes toward Trump. 
'I don't have any illusions that because of what I wrote or because it was under the masthead of Christianity Today that it's going to change many minds,' Galli said. 'It's not going to change many minds.' 
Galli said he agreed with many of the president's policy decisions "" including the judges he nominated and his support for antiabortion policies "" but could no longer balance what he viewed as substantive moral failures. He likened the president to a wife abuser who also has good qualities.
Several prominent white evangelical leaders rushed to the president's defense, citing his record and their contention that Trump's impeachment was a politically motivated hit job by Democrats. The Rev. Franklin Graham posted a long defense of Trump on his Facebook page, revealing that his father, Billy Graham, voted for Trump.
Several evangelical supporters of the president described him as an imperfect man who has nonetheless been good for their agenda.
'Nobody thinks Trump is Saint Donald,' said David Lane, an influential evangelical leader who organizes pastors. 'For whatever reason, in my opinion, God raised Donald Trump. Everything he said he's going to do, he's done from an evangelical standpoint. None of the other candidates in 2016 would have done what Donald Trump has done.' 
What has drawn white evangelicals to the president is a sense that he is always fighting for them and against an array of secular forces they detest, said Matt Moore, a former chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party with deep ties in the state. In South Carolina, Moore said, evangelicals support Trump even more than in 2016. 
'A lot of evangelicals believe the current culture war is a zero sum game and their side has to win,' Moore said. 'They see Trump as sort of a Moses figure who is leading them out of the wilderness.'
Trump asked on Twitter whether evangelicals would ever want former vice president Joe Biden, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), or those of the 'socialist/communist bent' to be their president. He has regularly argued to voters that they have to support him, no matter his foibles, because his opponents would be much worse on the issues they care about.
James Dobson, who founded Christian organization Focus on the Family, took issue with how the editorial did not state who should replace Trump: Vice President Pence or a Democrat? He ticked off more than a dozen issues in which he believed Democrats would be worse than Trump, such as school choice, abortion, Israel, gay rights and 'men in women's sports and boys in girls' locker rooms.'
Christianity Today's editorial is less likely to change hearts and minds as it is likely to help give voice to people who have been silent on Trump, said Doug Birdsall, who is honorary chair of Lausanne, an international movement of evangelicals that was started by Billy Graham. He said he sent the editorial to 500 influential leaders around the world on Friday. Billy Graham's grandson Boz Tchividjian praised the piece, calling it 'well said on so many levels.'
Birdsall, who organized a gathering in 2018 to discuss the Trump era, noted how some evangelical pastors and leaders have voiced their concerns in the past, including Max Lucado, Tim Keller, Peter Wehner and Washington Post columnist Mike Gerson.
'Those who have perhaps sat in silence not wanting to be divisive or political realize there's a certain point where . . . the dangers outweigh the choice of remaining silent,' he said. 'It's morally powerful.'
While most pastors will be delivering sermons Sunday focused on Jesus ahead of Christmas, Birdsall said he thinks the editorial will generate conversation.
'There's a sense that so-called evangelicals have a greater love for Trump than they do for Christ. Evangelicals have become synonymous with Trump. When you think of evangelicals, you don't think about Jesus and the Bible, you think of red hats and Trump,' he said.

At the magazine's small headquarters in Illinois, where about 50 people put out the publication, there were some cancellations Friday. David Sutter, a pastor at York Bible Church in Pennsylvania, described himself as a subscriber 'for years and years and years' but canceled after the editorial. 
But Galli said he has received much support to go along with the attacks. His children were amazed that the president had attacked him on Twitter. He was on CNN nearly every hour Friday, wearing a sweater vest to calmly discuss his piece.
Galli, who is retiring at the end of the year, said he wanted to correct some of the claims in the president's tweet. He said the magazine is not liberal and is not financially troubled, He also said it received a surge in donations and new subscribers, adding that he had not heard from the White House or anyone connected to Trump. 
'It has touched a chord beyond what I ever believed,' he said. 'We have a lot of evangelical readers who are saying thank you, and that's what we wanted to do, to support others who agree and who are saying, 'What you think is what we think.' So they know they aren't crazy.'

SEATTLE - An effort believed to be tied to the Iranian government attempted to identify, attack and breach email accounts belonging to a U.S. presidential campaign, government officials and journalists, according to new data unveiled by Microsoft, highlighting the continued global security threats that loom over the fast-approaching 2020 election.
The intrusion observed by Microsoft, spearheaded by an outfit it calls Phosphorus, made more than 2,700 attempts to identify personal email addresses that belonged to the company's customers over a 30-day period between August and September, 241 of which were then attacked. Four were compromised, but they do not belong to the presidential campaign or government officials, according to the tech giant.
Reuters and other news media outlets reported Friday that the hackers had targeted President Trump's campaign.
Microsoft said it notified the customers attacked and has worked with those whose accounts were compromised to secure them. It declined to disclose the names of the account holders, including the presidential campaign that had been targeted. Microsoft declined to comment beyond a blog post disclosing the news on Friday.
Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for President Trump's 2020 campaign, said he has ""no indication that any of our campaign infrastructure was targeted."" Asked to clarify whether Microsoft had contacted the campaign about Iranian targeting of either the campaign or campaign personnel's personal email accounts, Murtaugh said: ""We have no further comment.""
The news Friday is the latest reminder that the United States is probably still vulnerable to security threats when it comes to the 2020 presidential election - and not just from Russia. Analysts have seen an increase in cyberactivity by Iran and its proxies in recent months targeting the United States and other countries, as tensions have heightened between Iran and the West.
Tech giants such as Facebook and Twitter, and politicians and security officials have all made the next presidential election a priority as they race to combat hackers - some of whom are working for foreign governments.
Still, recent technology developments, such as increasingly realistic ""deepfake"" or otherwise manipulated videos, have many cybersecurity experts concerned about how hackers might be able to influence public perception.
During the last presidential election, U.S. officials uncovered a sprawling Kremlin-backed effort on major social media sites to trigger social and political unrest. Russian hackers also targeted Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by hacking the emails of one of her top lieutenants, the contents of which were later dumped on WikiLeaks.
Since then, other countries have come to adopt more of Russia's playbook. Iran for years had targeted U.S. officials through ""large-scale intrusion attempts,"" said John Hultquist, the director of intelligence analysis at the cybersecurity firm FireEye. But it has become more aggressive recently in response to President Trump, who has imposed extensive sanctions and pulled out of an international deal over the country's nuclear program, he said. 
""The Iranians are very aggressive, and they could leverage whatever access they get for an upper hand in any kind of negotiations,"" Hultquist added. ""They could cause a lot of mayhem.""
Other tech companies also have been warning about the rising Iranian threat, largely out of concern that malicious actors originating in the country were spreading disinformation online. In May, for example, Facebook and Twitter said they had removed a sprawling Iranian-based propaganda operation, including accounts that mimicked Republican congressional candidates and appeared to try to push pro-Iranian political messages on social media. Some of those accounts similarly took aim at U.S. policymakers and journalists, researchers said at the time.
Christopher Krebs, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency under the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement that the agency is working with Microsoft.
""Microsoft's claims that a presidential campaign was targeted is yet more evidence that our adversaries are looking to undermine our democratic institutions,"" he said in the statement.

Microsoft software is present in far more computers around the world than U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies, giving the company a broader window into the threat.
The Democratic National Committee warned campaigns about the Phosphorus attacks Tuesday, noting that the hacking group has been targeting personal and professional email accounts. It recommended that members review logs for connection attempts in August and September.
""They create believable spear phishing emails and fake LinkedIn profiles as primary tactics,"" according to the email from the DNC obtained by The Washington Post. Microsoft also owns the LinkedIn professional social network.
Spokespeople for Democratic candidates, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.), did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople for former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) declined to comment. Ian Sams, a spokesman for Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), said he had ""no indication that our campaign is the one Microsoft referenced or that we have been targeted by this attack.""
To target political and government officials' emails, Phosphorus hackers tried to figure out how to reset passwords or otherwise trigger account recovery features to take over accounts, Microsoft said. In some instances, Microsoft found that the group gathered phone numbers belonging to its targets to try to authenticate password resets.
The attacks were not ""technically sophisticated,"" Microsoft's vice president of customer security and trust, Tom Burt, wrote in the blog post. But he noted that they used significant amounts of the targets' personal information, suggesting that Phosphorus was willing to invest ""significant time and resources engaging in research and other means of information gathering.""
This isn't Microsoft's first brush with Phosphorus. The company, which names hacking groups after elements on the periodic table, seized 99 websites in March that it said were used by the group to launch cyberattacks against government agencies, businesses and users in Washington. Microsoft said it has been tracking the group for six years. Other researchers have tagged the group Ajax Security Team, APT 35 and Charming Kitten.
Phosphorus used the websites Microsoft seized this spring to trick visitors into downloading malicious software that appeared authentic. But that was only one of the group's tactics. In Phosphorus's latest attempts, the group tried to trick users into giving up codes that are used for two-factor authentication.

AUGUSTA, Ga. "" After two weeks in the presidential race, Mike Bloomberg now employs one of the largest campaign staff rosters, has spent more money on ads than all the top-polling Democrats combined and is simultaneously building out ground operations in 27 states.
But when the former New York mayor showed up to get the endorsement of Augusta Mayor Hardie Davis Jr. on Friday, only two of the 10 chairs initially placed before the lectern were occupied. When Bloomberg joked about his college years, saying he 'was one of the students who made the top half of the class possible,' he was met by silence.
'You're supposed to laugh at that, folks,' Bloomberg said to a room at the city's African American history museum filled mostly with staff and media. 
For a normal presidential campaign, such moments would be a worrying sign, a potentially viral metaphor for a struggling effort. But with the Bloomberg campaign, it is not at all clear what established rules apply, if any. Everything he is doing is so unlike what has been done for decades that it is difficult to decipher how voters will react. 
Rather than focus on the early states, he is campaigning for votes deep in the 2020 calendar, in places where voters are less tuned in to the nominating process. Rather than worry about a budget, he has put no limit on the money he is prepared to spend. Rather than run in a Democratic primary by appealing to ideological die-hards or partisan flag bearers, he describes himself as 'basically nonpartisan.' 
Although far outside the box, the effort is not easily dismissed. As a former three-term New York mayor, he comes to the race with more executive governing experience and has represented more voters than most of his competitors, as well as a philanthropic record he has emphasized in campaign ads while pushing several core liberal priorities, including increased gun regulation and the reduction of carbon pollution. His campaign message is focused on his own competence and electability.
Rival campaigns worry about the creeping possibility that he finds a way to catch fire if the early states deliver no clear front-runner, or that he wins enough delegates to deny anyone a majority, granting him a brokering role in choosing the nominee before the convention. His ability to dominate airwaves could also raise advertising rates for everyone else.
His campaign's senior staff, who did not know a month ago that they would be building a nine-figure operation, now projects that he will soon register significantly in national polls and potentially change the way people think about the nominating contest. 
'The theory of the case is that we are running a national campaign,' said Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey. 'From my point of view, no one has ever run a national primary campaign since Kennedy in 1960.' 
Already, there are hundreds of staff members working remotely or out of the temporary campaign headquarters in one of Bloomberg's Beaux-Arts limestone mansions on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where the blinds rise and fall with the time of day, the food is free and a selection of his museum-quality art collection is on display.
The campaign has been offering field organizers salaries of $6,000 a month, a 70 percent premium from the going rate of $3,500 paid by the campaigns of Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). It has picked up key hires such as Dan Kanninen, a former aide to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton in 2016 and to Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) during his successful 2008 campaign; former Obama organizer Mitch Stewart; Obama's former Ohio strategist Aaron Pickrell; and Gary Briggs, a former top marketing executive for Facebook and Google.
The money they have been sending out the door for advertising is record-setting. Since his campaign launch on Nov. 24, Bloomberg has spent or reserved about $60 million in television and radio ads, with no sign of slowing down. Taken together, the top four polling Democrats in the race "" former vice president Joe Biden; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Sanders and Warren "" have spent about $28 million on similar ads all year. 
 He has also purchased $4.6 million of Google ads, from YouTube spots that run alongside video game streamers to classic search promotions. That is more than any other Democratic campaign has spent over the full year, according to the company. On Facebook, his spending over the past week ran at more than $170,000 a day, 2
1/2-
times the level of President Trump's reelection campaign and about three times more than Tom Steyer, the other billionaire Democrat seeking the nomination. All his digital ads are focused on increasing his support and recruiting staff, rather than the fundraising that occupies other campaigns. 
Before he announced in March that he would not run for president, Bloomberg, 77, had drawn up plans for a more traditional campaign. When he entered in November, he decided to skip the first four contests, which tend to pick presidential nominees by showing early momentum and redirecting the national focus. 
Instead, his operation is aimed at the 25 states that will award nearly two-thirds of the available convention delegates over a 15-day period that begins March 3. The campaign plans to employ hundreds of field staff in those states, plus Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which vote later but are expected to be key swing states in the general election. 
'It is a massive undertaking,' said Kanninen, who has come on to run Bloomberg's state strategy. 'I think it is safe to say from a size-of-the-map perspective and the number of contests that we will be competing in, it is something no one has ever tried to do before.' 
One of the reasons no one has ever tried it is that no one has ever been able to afford it. But Bloomberg's net worth is estimated at around $55 billion by Forbes "" roughly 565,000 times the median American household. Even if he spends $2.7 billion on media, the total amount the firm Advertising Analytics expected to be expended by all candidates running for president this cycle, he will have only relinquished about a twentieth of his funds. 
 The carpet-bombing ad approach has yet to register much in the polls, where he languishes in the low single digits, slightly above the rest of the second-tier candidates. But his advisers say they are not worried that they will be able to breach the 15-percent threshold required by party rules to gain delegates. 
'We will be viable,' Sheekey said. 'The next time you see a national poll you will see the results.'

Rival Democratic strategists remain skeptical of the effort, as they focus on finding a way for their candidates to catch fire in the early states. Bloomberg's campaign skills are rusty, and he has already encountered some bumps. 
In an interview on Thursday with 'CBS This Morning,' Bloomberg praised Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who is black, by calling him 'well spoken,' prompting Booker to object and Bloomberg to acknowledge that he could have chosen his words better. Bloomberg also said falsely that he had not been asked about his support for stop-and-frisk policing before he reversed himself on the issue last month. On Friday, he said he 'quite honestly didn't remember' an instance in January when the issue was raised with him. 
'You can buy a certain amount of people who are undecided in polls,' said a top adviser to a rival candidate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal campaign thinking. 'Now, when you are in the ballot box or in the caucus site, it's a different thing altogether.' 
The Trump campaign, by contrast, has chosen to attack Bloomberg early, with Trump tweeting about 'Mini Mike Bloomberg' and announcing he would bar reporters for Bloomberg's eponymous news organization from his campaign events. (The top editor of Bloomberg News has said the organization will continue to cover the presidential race, while refraining from investigating Bloomberg or his Democratic rivals.) 
The immediate threat to Trump has less to do with Bloomberg winning the nomination than with his prolific spending hurting the president in the swing states where the general election will be decided. Through the Bloomberg campaign and a separate anti-Trump digital effort he is funding, a campaign adviser said, Bloomberg has already spent more than $8.3 million in television and digital ads in six core swing states: Florida, Wisconsin, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. 
Even campaign spots focused on Bloomberg's biography include a negative reference to the sitting president. The Trump campaign declined a request for comment.
Bloomberg initially decided not to run for president largely because of Biden's apparent strength in the weeks after he entered the race, and Bloomberg's fear that they would split the moderate vote. But since then, Bloomberg, who has always cast himself as a competent manager able to build and run large organizations, decided that Biden and the rest of the field were not up for the job of beating Trump. 
'When I took a look at what was happening and things were getting worse "" and I didn't see others that I thought could beat Donald Trump "" I said, 'Shame on me if I didn't have the courage to stand up and at least try,' ' Bloomberg said in Augusta.

Bloomberg has a long history of shifting tack with ease. He supported two-term limits for New York's mayor before he successfully changed the law to win a third term, and then supported reimposing two-term limits. He announced he would not return to running his company, Bloomberg LLC, after leaving city hall, before doing just that. 
Bloomberg's decision to reverse himself again to join the presidential contest came as a surprise to even his closest political advisers. They presented Bloomberg with new polling in early November, shortly after the New York Times released surveys that showed Trump competitive "" or defeating Democrats "" in key battleground states. The Bloomberg numbers were even worse for Democrats, showing Trump with an advantage, campaign aides said. 
The former mayor's advisers suggested he increase his investments in an independent general-election effort that had been planned for swing states, and broke for the night. Bloomberg showed up at work at 6:30 the following morning, and waited 30-minutes to call his aides. 
'He said 'Listen, I thought about it overnight and I have decided to run,' ' Sheekey said. 'I did not expect that call.' 
Bloomberg submitted signatures to make the Alabama ballot days later, and soon made his formal announcement. 
Addressing reporters after his remarks in Georgia, Bloomberg made clear that he saw his presidential campaign as an extension of his philanthropic endeavors. 'A president of the United States can really have a much bigger impact,' he said.
He would not commit to spending an equivalent amount for a different Democratic nominee, saying 'I don't think I'm going to be in a situation where I've got to look at another Democratic candidate and help them.' But he did affirm that, 'regardless of who the Democratic candidate is, I will support them.'
His aides have repeatedly emphasized that his motivation to run is not an aversion to the more liberal candidates in the race, like Warren and Sanders, who have proposed much higher taxes for billionaires like him and enormous new government programs.
'He is not afraid of them winning,' said Howard Wolfson, another top political adviser. 'He is afraid they are not going to win.' 
For the moment, his campaign has focused on states to which no other candidate is paying significant attention. He has traveled to Arkansas, Colorado, Mississippi and Georgia to gather endorsements, announce policies and get photographed having meals at local diners. The events, advisers say, have been intentionally small, with little public notice, and have taken place sometimes in venues that require an invitation. 
The campaign has plans for larger events in the coming months, leveraging the broad network of relationships he has made with liberal groups, including organizations that oppose gun violence, that Bloomberg has funded. In 2018, he said, he gave away $767 million. Recipients have included groups such as Planned Parenthood, the Sierra Club, smoking-cessation efforts and a number of grant projects for cities and mayors around the country. 
On Saturday, he traveled to Texas to address the state party executive committee, delighting local leaders who are eager for him to contribute to their efforts. In 2018, he made a habit of leaving behind checks when he visited early nomination states. He gave $250,000 to the Iowa state party, $500,000 to the Georgia state party and $50,000 to the South Carolina State party, according to public records.
'What the Bloomberg folks are saying is they have two goals, one to be the nominee and the second is to help local state parties to start beefing up and increasing turnout,' said Texas party chairman Gilberto Hinojosa, who got a call from Bloomberg on his cellphone the day before Thanksgiving. 'They know that Texas is not only important to the Democratic primary but it is extremely important in the general election.' 

Bloomberg used the platform to assail Trump "" saying he was the only New York billionaire in the race "" in a shot at the president's fortune and drawing a standing ovation from a throng that included state and local candidates who shook his hand and posed for selfies.
'The way I see it, Texas is the biggest battleground state, and I'm going to fight like hell to win its 38 electoral votes,' Bloomberg said.
Debra Kerner, a candidate for the Texas State Board of Education, is considering Bloomberg but said she prefers other presidential hopefuls who better represent the diversifying electorate in Texas. 
Asked why she had approached the former mayor, telling him her cousin is married to his former schools superintendent, Kerner said, 'I mean, I would like a donation.'

Campaigns push divisive issues after summer of centrism, as vote looms 

RICHMOND - GayDonna Vandergriff has spent much of the year running for the House of Delegates with Hillary-blue campaign signs and a website that touts public schools and the environment but makes no mention that she's a Republican.

But days before Tuesday's state election, Vandergriff is executing a hard right turn toward her GOP base. She is blasting her opponent, Democratic incumbent Del. Schuyler T. VanValkenburg, as a ""socialist"" who wants to abort babies at the moment of birth and ""chooses illegal immigrants over his own constituents.""
In crucial swing districts, from Northern Virginia to Richmond to Hampton Roads, Republican candidates are trying to turn out GOP voters while hoping they can hang on to the centrist images they cultivated all summer. To pull it off, they're casting Democrats as extremists - invoking hot-button issues such as abortion and immigration that Republicans had largely avoided as they attempted to soften their connection to an unpopular President Trump.
""The strategy was to try to make it comfortable for women to vote Republican again,"" longtime Virginia political analyst Robert Holsworth said. The harsh turn ""may be a risky strategy because it may remind people again of their Republican identity, which at the moment is not that popular in suburban Virginia.""
Democrats, too, have resorted to tougher tactics as next week's election looms, depicting Republicans as chummy with Trump and in the pocket of the National Rifle Association. But that's consistent with the strategy they've adopted all along, in a year when national Democrats view Virginia as a tuneup for next fall's presidential contest.
""The road to 2020 runs through 2019,"" Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O'Rourke said in a video the Democratic Party of Virginia tweeted on Wednesday. ""And the success for the United States of America is dependent on what we do this year in the commonwealth of Virginia.""
With all 140 seats in the General Assembly on the ballot next week, control of the legislature is at stake. Republicans are defending slight majorities of 20-19 in the Senate and 51-48 in the House of Delegates, with one vacancy in each chamber.
If Democrats can win both, they'll consolidate power with Gov. Ralph Northam and be able to push through an ambitious agenda of gun control, abortion access, environmental protections, a higher minimum wage and passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. They'll also oversee redistricting in 2021 after the U.S. Census, setting the course for Virginia politics for the next decade.
Many of the Democratic issues poll well with Virginians, particularly in the suburbs - which is why Republican candidates treated them carefully for much of the summer. A number of GOP incumbents have touted their support for Medicaid expansion even though they opposed it for years until a few joined with Democrats to pass it in 2018.
Sen. Glen H. Sturtevant (R-Richmond), considered one of the most vulnerable incumbents because his district has become increasingly blue, initially focused on health care in a campaign that could have been mistaken for a Democrat's.
""Health care shouldn't be a partisan issue,"" he says in an ad launched in mid-September. ""My mom suffered a near heart attack. Then her insurance surprised her with a bill they refused to pay. I'm taking on the insurance companies to stop surprise billing.""
But Sturtevant, who has spent nearly $1 million on TV ads, has recently lobbed sharp attacks at his Democratic challenger, Ghazala Hashmi. ""Hashmi's radical politics are just like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,"" one ad says, referring to the liberal first-term New York congresswoman.
Another ad pairs Hashmi's image with those of Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont democratic socialist running for president. ""Ghazala Hashmi wants to bring Washington's extreme socialist agenda to Virginia,"" it says.
Hashmi has spent $812,000 on ads, beginning with upbeat biographical spots but turning more recently to attacks on Sturtevant's record and ""slick image campaign.""
""Sturtevant voted to deny health coverage to 400,000 Virginians,"" one ad says, referring to his opposition to expanding Medicaid. Another ad shows newspaper headlines on mass shootings, including one that reads, ""Massacre on campus.""
""If you ever wonder why this keeps happening, it's because Republican politicians like Glen Sturtevant block laws that would save lives,"" the ad says. Another ad highlights Sturtevant's A rating from the NRA. A YouTube spot calls his tactics ""a page right out of Donald Trump's playbook.""
Republican Sen. Siobhan S. Dunnavant (Henrico) is another incumbent in a rapidly shifting district who played down her party affiliation during much of the campaign. Early on, Dunnavant, an OB/GYN with an A rating from the NRA, released an ad that cast her as a doctor and mother concerned about gun violence.
But in the final weeks, Dunnavant is focused on abortion. 
Earlier this year, Del. Kathy Tran (D-Fairfax) presented a bill to a General Assembly subcommittee that would have loosened restrictions on late-term abortions. Tran's testimony that the bill would allow abortion up to the point of delivery - something Virginia law already allows in certain circumstances - drew national outrage from conservatives and figured to be a prominent talking point for Republican campaigns.
After Alabama and several other states sought drastic abortion restrictions this summer, though, Virginia Republicans backed off the issue, fearing that voters would see it as a broader attack on abortion rights.
Dunnavant has cast that caution aside. Her recent ad uses video in which Dunnavant's opponent - Del. Debra H. Rodman of Henrico - is standing next to Tran during the controversial testimony.
Rodman's role as a co-sponsor of Tran's bill ""kind of makes it hard to resist,"" said a Republican strategist familiar with Dunnavant's campaign, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy. ""Independents, when they see that video, they're turned off. . . . We thought it would be important to put in front of voters as part the closing message. And we think it's working.""
Rodman's campaign has countered with mailers saying Dunnavant wants an ""extreme ban"" on abortion, based on recorded comments in which Dunnavant says she would like to ban abortion after 12 weeks unless the mother's life is at risk.
 Rodman is also airing a TV ad that features another Henrico County OB/GYN accusing Dunnavant of undermining the Affordable Care Act with a bill that would have expanded low-cost, short-term plans that do not cover preexisting conditions.
""The truth is, Senator Dunnavant's 96% Republican party-line voting record to block Medicaid Expansion and gun safety legislation is completely out of line with what our community cares about,"" Rodman said in an email. In Virginia Beach, Republican challenger Shannon Kane sent a mailer in which an image of Democratic Del. Kelly K. Convirs-Fowler had been Photoshopped into a picture of MS-13 gang members, provoking cries of racism like those that greeted a similar tactic by GOP gubernatorial nominee Ed Gillespie in 2017.
Also in Virginia Beach, the husband of a victim of that city's May 31 mass shooting complained that his words were used without his permission in a mailer for incumbent Sen. William R. DeSteph Jr. (R). DeSteph said he had no control over the mailer, which - in an unusual move - was funded by the Republican Party of Virginia but not coordinated with the candidate.
In Richmond, Democrat VanValkenburg has faced relentless attacks as he defends the seat he flipped to blue from red two years ago. His own words are being thrown back at him: In 2016, before he held office, VanValkenburg defended U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine (D) against criticism from the left. Writing on Facebook that ""I identify as socialist in many ways,"" he slammed socialists for judging Kaine as not progressive enough.

His reelection opponent, Vandergriff, has taken the comments literally and depicted him in a Soviet-style poster, continually referring to him as a socialist. VanValkenburg, a high school government teacher, dismisses the attacks as ""such a caricature of that kind of Trump style.""
But they have drawn notice. Constituent Jim Schroering stopped his truck on Sunday afternoon when he saw VanValkenburg canvassing his neighborhood. ""I can't believe what I just got in the mail,"" Schroering, 61, said, then described one of Vandergriff's mailers.
""I was so disgusted by looking at it,"" Schroering said. He said that he had seen Vandergriff's campaign signs earlier and hadn't been able to figure out her party affiliation, but that the attack ads cleared up the mystery. ""That's got to be a Republican,"" he said.
Vandergriff's campaign did not respond to requests for comment. But a spokesman for the State Government Leadership Foundation (SGLF) - a partner of the Republican State Leadership Committee, which focuses on winning state-level elections for Republicans - defended the tactic.
""Schuyler VanValkenburg labeled himself a socialist on his personal Facebook page,"" SGLF spokesman David Abrams said via email. ""Our issue ad is simply sharing his own words, along with his record of support for the dangerous policies of radical liberals like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Questions about VanValkenburg's socialist views should be directed to VanValkenburg.""

LONDON "" The day after a historically decisive election in Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson vowed to unify a divided country, while leaders of the opposition Labour Party fought over the reasons for their crushing loss.
On Friday morning, Johnson had an 'audience' with Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace, where, in keeping with tradition, he asked for her permission to form a government. In the final tally, his party won 365 out of 650 seats in the House of Commons.
'Let the healing begin,' Johnson urged to a society that has been at war with itself since a narrowly decided Brexit referendum more than three years ago. 
He vowed to use his party's commanding parliamentary majority "" the largest the Conservatives have enjoyed since the times of Margaret Thatcher "" to make Brexit happen but also 'to unite and level up.'
Unity may prove an elusive mission, especially since Scottish voters flocked to a nationalist and pro-Europe party that immediately threatened to pursue a second independence referendum.
Even if many Brits were exhausted by the Brexit debate, polls suggest they are as divided as ever on their country's relationship with the European Union.
The prime minister said, essentially, that resistance is futile and that Britons who hoped to remain in the E.U. must move on.
Punching the air, in a rumpled suit and with his blond mop of hair askew, Johnson proclaimed: 'Getting Brexit done is now the irrefutable, irresistible, unarguable decision of the British people.' 
'With this election, I think we've now put an end to all those miserable threats of a second referendum,' he said.
Later in the day, he addressed those partial to the E.U. in gentler terms.
'We in this one-nation Conservative government will never ignore your good and positive feelings of warmth and sympathy towards the other nations of Europe,' Johnson said while speaking outside Downing Street. 'Because now is the moment "" precisely as we leave the E.U. "" to let those natural feelings find renewed expression in building a new partnership, which is one of the great projects for next year.' 
Johnson wants to get Britain out of the E.U. by the end of next month and to have a new trade deal with Europe in place by the end of an 11-month transition period. Now that he has a parliamentary majority, that first part should be relatively easy. The second part remains hard.
A lingering question was how much Johnson would pivot away from the austerity politics imposed after the financial crisis by previous Conservative governments to embrace a kind of Tory nanny state. 
He made big spending promises in the campaign: spending on nurses, hospitals, schools and police. On Friday, he told traditional Labour voters who supported the Conservatives for the first time that he would work to prove they made the right choice.
As significant as Johnson's victory was the defeat for the Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn and his self-described radical socialist agenda.
Labour on Thursday had its worst electoral showing since World War II.
Conservatives won big by taking a battering ram to Labour's 'red wall,' the line of fading industrial towns in England's north and Midlands, where the working classes have traditionally backed Labour since World War I.
On Friday, Corbyn announced that he would not lead the party in any future general elections, though he hoped to stay on as leader during a period of 'reflection.'
When Corbyn became party leader in 2015, his supporters believed his left-wing populism was the answer to the rise of the populist far right. Liberal politicians beyond Britain "" U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) among them "" were urged to take heart from the way he succeeded in shifting his party left.
Hours before the polls closed in Britain on Thursday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) sought to rally support for Labour.
'The hoarding of wealth by the few is coming at the cost of peoples' lives,' she tweeted. 'The only way we change is with a massive surge of new voters at the polls. UK, Vote!'
But on Friday, the vote result was seen in some quarters as a potential warning light about the viability of left-wing platforms in Europe "" and maybe in the United States ahead of a presidential election.
'The lessons are ones you'd expect to draw: It's really easy to appeal to your base "" bases are really easy to speak to because they are there,' said Simon Usherwood, a politics professor at the University of Surrey.
What's hard, Usherwood said, 'is reaching out to people in the center, the swing voters,' which is important in countries like the United States and Britain, both of which have two dominant parties. 'If you don't reach out and try and take people off the other lot, you're not going to get anywhere.'
The arguments that raged within Labour on Friday mirrored arguments that have divided left-wing parties across the Western world, though Brexit complicated matters.
Corbyn and others blamed the party's losses primarily on the dominance of Brexit.
'Brexit has polarized and divided debate within this country,' Corbyn said Friday morning. 'It has overridden so much of a normal political debate.'
While Johnson led the crusade for Brexit, Corbyn took a noncommittal stance, giving lukewarm support to the idea of a second referendum and saying he would remain neutral in that vote.
Ian Lavery, the Labour chairman, blamed the party's poor showing on the promise of a second referendum. 'Ignore democracy and, to be quite honest, the consequences will come back and bite you,' he told the BBC.
Others pointed the finger at Corbyn, a leader who is highly unpopular with the British public and who struggled to address allegations of anti-Semitism within his faction.
'Corbyn was a disaster on the doorstep,' senior Labour politician Alan Johnson said in an apoplectic exchange on television with a Corbyn acolyte. 'Everyone knew that he couldn't lead the working class out of a paper bag.'
At times, Corbyn's supporters seemed to be campaigning more against centrists than they were against Johnson and the Conservatives. 
Labour, with the support of activists in the far-left Momentum movement, purged the party of centrists, whom they branded as revanchist disciples of former Labour prime minister Tony Blair. Blair is loathed by many Labour activists today, largely for his support of the Iraq War and his 'third-way' neoliberal economic policies that echoed those of President Bill Clinton. But Blair was also the most electorally successful, longest-serving Labour prime minister of the postwar years.
Labour's debate about purity vs. pragmatism is one that should be familiar to the American left.
But even beyond Brexit, there are reasons to be cautious about extrapolating to an American context.
What counts as liberal in the United States would hardly qualify as such in Britain, a creator of the postwar welfare state. By British standards, figures like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), seen as liberal in the United States, are more in line with traditional mainstream Labour figures, at least in terms of their policy proposals. 
But Britain, much like the United States, has also traditionally shied away from left-wing leaders with policies as far to the left as Corbyn's. Even in the 1960s and 1970s, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson was relatively moderate by the standards of the time, as was James Callaghan after him. 
Labour has traditionally been strong on defense, anti-Communist and relatively low on ideology. A Corbyn victory would have represented a radical departure.

The sixth Democratic presidential debate of the 2020 campaign, hosted by PBS and Politico, had 10 candidates, lasted more than 2
1
/2 hours "" and did not have many statements that merited fact-checking. Here are six claims that caught our attention. Our practice is not to award Pinocchios in debate roundups. This piece was co-written with colleague Salvador Rizzo. 



'The mayor just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave, full of crystals and served $900-a-bottle wine. Think about who comes to that. He had promised that every fundraiser he would do would be open-door, but this one was closed-door.'



"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.)



'Your presence here, your campaign right now as we speak, is funded in part by money you transferred having raised it at those exact same big-ticket fundraisers you now denounce. Did it corrupt you, senator? Of course not.' 



"" South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg

The first high-profile tussle of the night came when Warren attacked Buttigieg for courting high-dollar donors in the Democratic primary, something she has eschewed this year, decrying the influence of money in politics.
Her attack misfired somewhat. Buttigieg did hold a high-dollar fundraiser in a wine cave, but it was not closed to onlookers. In fact, it was the first fundraiser that Buttigieg opened up after sustaining weeks of criticism from, among others, Warren.
At the debate, Buttigieg responded by noting that Warren seeded her presidential campaign with a sizable financial transfer from her 2018 Senate campaign. For that prior race, Warren did not have the same restrictive fundraising practices in place that she does now.
As we've reported, Warren did seek contributions from high-dollar donors when she last ran for Senate. Then, after winning reelection, she transferred $10.4-million from her Senate committee to her presidential campaign, which allowed her to get a head start in the primary race.
A search of Warren's records with the Federal Election Commission for the 2018 Senate race showed max contributions of $5,400 from the chief executives of DreamWorks and Yelp, media mogul Haim Saban, philanthropist Alexander Soros, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, hedge fund owners and wealthy investors, and some donors who have given millions to the Democratic Party. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, film director Steven Spielberg, and singer and actress Barbra Streisand each donated $2,700 to Warren's Senate campaign.
We previously gave Two Pinocchios to Warren for claiming her presidential campaign was '100% grassroots-funded.'





'Ninety-five percent of our customers are outside of our borders.' 



"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.)

This line from Klobuchar is a bit deceiving. Biden has also used it, though not in this debate.
The U.S. population, standing at more than 320-million, rounds to nearly 5-percent of the world population. Going only by this metric, yes, 95-percent of all theoretical consumers of U.S. goods are 'outside of our borders.'
But trade doesn't work that way. As PolitiFact reported when Biden delivered the same line in July, 'The vast majority of people across the world are quite poor and will not generally be in the market for American products.' They rated the claim 'half true.'





'We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth.'



"" Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)

There are various ways to frame this, but note that Sanders says 'almost any major country.' That's generally code for members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of the 36 wealthiest countries. But Sanders appears to be operating from stale data. (His staff has previously pointed to a 2012 UNICEF report that showed the United States just behind Romania.)
The OECD, in a report updated in November, lists the United States sixth from the bottom. Chile, Spain, Israel, Turkey and Brazil had higher rates of child poverty in 2016.
A 2017 UNICEF report also places the United States sixth, but with a different group of OECD countries with higher rates of child poverty: Spain, Mexico, Turkey, Israel and Romania ranked lower.







'This is why three people have more wealth than the bottom half.'



"" Sanders 

Sanders is drawing on a 2017 report from the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies, which said that three billionaires "" Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos (who owns The Washington Post) and Warren Buffett "" had a total wealth of $248.5-billion, compared with $245 billion for the bottom 160-million of the United States. The wealth of the three men has gone up even more since then.
But people in the bottom half have essentially no wealth, as debts cancel out whatever assets they might have, according to Emmanuel Saez, the University of California at Berkeley professor who is a pioneer in this field of research.
'The real scandal here is that the bottom half of the U.S. families owns essentially no wealth on net, because debts cancel out whatever small assets they may have, on average,' he said in an email. 'If you exclude cars (consumer durables), the wealth of the bottom 50% is actually slightly negative according to the most recent distributional Fed statistics. You don't even need to be a billionaire to actually own more than what the bottom half of Americans own! Billionaires in the Forbes 400 owned slightly less than 1% of total wealth back in 1982, they now own about 3.5% of total wealth. That's another alarming trend.'



'The idea of a 2-cent tax on great fortunes in this country "" $50-million and above for 2-cents . . . . I have a 2-cent wealth tax proposed for millionaires and billionaires.' 



"" Warren

Warren twice pitched her '2-cent tax' on wealthy Americans, but she did not mention that for the richest Americans, the tab keeps getting higher.
Warren's 'Ultra-Millionaire Tax' would apply to households with a net worth of $50-million or more, essentially the wealthiest 75,000 households. They would be charged 2-percent of every dollar of net worth above $50-million, unless they're billionaires.
Households with $1-billion or more in assets would start paying 3-percent on assets above $1-billion. At least that was in Warren's first iteration of her tax plans. She said this tax would raise $2.75-trillion over 10 years. But to help fund her plan for universal health care, she recently announced that she would also charge another 3-percent to billionaires, for a total of 6-percent. So that's 6-cents.
'By asking billionaires to pitch in 6-cents on each dollar of net worth above $1-billion, we can raise an additional $1-trillion in revenue,' Warren said in explaining how she would fill the $20.5-trillion hole created by her Medicare-for-all proposal. While 6-percent a year may not seem like much, over 10 years it would quickly add up.







'Five hundred thousand Americans, including 30,000 veterans, are sleeping out on the streets today in America.'



"" Sanders

The way Sanders frames this is exaggerated. His number came from a single-night survey done by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to measure the number of homeless people. For a single night in January 2018, the estimate was that 553,000 people are homeless.
But the report also says that two-thirds "" nearly 360,000 "" were in emergency shelters or transitional housing programs; the other 195,000 were 'unsheltered,' i.e. on the streets, as Sanders put it. The number has been trending down over the past decade. It was 650,000 in 2007.
As for veterans, the 2018 figure for all homeless veterans was nearly 38,000 in 2018. But fewer than 15,000 were unsheltered. The rest "" 62-percent "" were in sheltered locations.

Sanders and Warren
set sights on super-rich,
who aren't going along
The political and economic power wielded by the approximately 750 wealthiest people in America has become a sudden flash point in the 2020 presidential election, as the nation's billionaires push back with increasing ferocity against calls by liberal politicians to vastly reduce their fortunes and clout.
On Thursday, Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire and former mayor of New York City, took steps to enter the presidential race, a move that would make him one of four billionaires who either plan to seek or have expressed interest in seeking the nation's highest office in 2020. His decision came one week after Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) proposed vastly expanding her 'wealth tax' on the nation's biggest wealth holders and one month after Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said the United States should not have any billionaires at all.
The populist onslaught has ensnared Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, led to billionaire hand-wringing on cable news, and sparked a panicked discussion among wealthy Americans and their financial advisers about how to prepare for a White House controlled by populist Democrats.
Past presidential elections have involved allegations of class warfare, but rarely have those debates centered on such a small subset of people.
'For the first time ever, we are having a national political conversation about billionaires in American life. And that is because many people are noticing the vast differences in wealth and opportunity,' said Timothy Naftali, a historian at New York University.
The growing hostilities between the ascendant populist wing of the Democratic Party and the nation's tech and financial elite have spilled repeatedly into public view over the past several months, but they reached a crescendo last week with news that Bloomberg may enter the Democratic primary race. With the stock market at an all-time high, the debate about wealth accumulation and inequality has become a top issue in the 2020 campaign.
The leaders of the anti-billionaire populist surge, Warren and Sanders, have cast their plans to vastly increase taxes on the wealthy as necessary to fix several decades of widening inequality and make necessary investments in health care, child-care spending and other government programs they say will help working-class Americans.
Financial disparities between the rich and everyone else have widened over the past several decades, with inequality returning to levels not seen since the 1920s, as the richest 400 Americans now control more wealth than the bottom 60-percent of the wealth distribution, according to research by Gabriel Zucman, a left-leaning economist at the University of California at Berkeley. The poorest 60-percent of Americans have seen their share of the national wealth fall from 5.7-percent in 1987 to 2.1-percent in 2014, Zucman found.
But the efforts at redistribution pushed by Warren and Sanders have elicited a fierce and sometimes personal backlash from the billionaires who stand to lose the most. At least 16 billionaires have in recent months spoken out against what they regard as the danger posed by the populist Democrats, particularly over their proposals to enact a wealth tax on vast fortunes, with many expressing concern that they will hand the election to President Trump by veering too far left.
Bloomberg's potential presidential bid follows that of fellow billionaires Tom Steyer, a major Democratic donor, and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who in September suspended his independent presidential bid. Steyer has proposed his own wealth tax, but Schultz ripped the idea as 'ridiculous,' while Bloomberg suggested it was not constitutional and raised the prospect of America turning into Venezuela.
Piling on against the wealth tax have been corporate celebrities from Silicon Valley and Wall Street. Zuckerberg suggested Sanders's call to abolish billionaires could hurt philanthropies and scientific research by giving the government too much decision-making power. Microsoft co-founder Gates criticized Warren's wealth tax and mused about its impact on 'the incentive system' for making money.
David Rubenstein, the billionaire co-founder of the Carlyle Group, told CNBC that a wealth tax would not 'solve all of our society's problems' and raised questions about its practicality. Also appearing on CNBC, billionaire investor Leon Cooperman choked up while discussing the impact a wealth tax could have on his family.
'I don't need Elizabeth Warren, or the government, giving away my money,' Cooperman said. '[Warren] and Bernie Sanders are presenting a lot of ideas to the public that are morally and socially bankrupt.'
Then there is perhaps the most prominent wealthy person of all likely to stand in the way of populist Democrats' proposals: Trump. Asked about the wealth tax, a White House spokesman declined to comment directly on the proposal but said in an email, 'President Trump has been very clear: America will never be a socialist country.'
But there are signs that the pushback is having little impact on nixing the idea in Democrats' minds. Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.), who has endorsed former vice president Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination, told The Post he is crafting a new wealth-tax proposal to introduce in the House. Boyle's involvement suggests that the idea has broader political support among Democrats than previously thought.
Warren's campaign has created a tax calculator that shows how much money multimillionaires would pay under her plan. The initial wealth tax proposed by Warren would raise close to $3-trillion over 10 years "" enough money to fund universal child care, make public colleges and universities tuition-free, and forgive most of the student debt held in the United States, according to some nonpartisan estimates.
The country has long had rich people, but economists say the current scale of inequality may be without precedent. The number of U.S. billionaires swelled to 749 in 2018, a nearly 5-percent jump, and they now hold close to $4-trillion collectively.
'The hyper-concentration of wealth within the top 0.1-percent is a mortal threat to the American economy and way of life,' Boyle said in an interview. 'If you work hard and play by the rules, then you should be able to get ahead. But the recent and unprecedented shift of resources to billionaires threatens this. A wealth tax on billionaires is fair and, indeed, necessary.'
But conservatives and even many Democrats have raised objections to the wealth tax, arguing that it could be skirted easily and may have limited political appeal. Microsoft's Gates, famous for his philanthropic efforts, joked to the New York Times that such a tax could erase his entire fortune. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) last week proposed a surtax on couples earning more than $2-million a year to address what they framed as unfairness in the tax code exacerbated by the Republican tax cuts, while stopping short of the starker wealth tax.
In an email, Bloomberg adviser Howard Wolfson denied that the prospect of paying the wealth tax factors into the former mayor's interest in running for president: 'Mike's not worried about what would happen if Elizabeth Warren won. He's worried about what would happen if Donald Trump won.'
Still, the ultrarich have taken notice of the threat, according to interviews with a half-dozen financial planners and wealth managers.
Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, whose membership includes many of the country's biggest financial firms, said members of the business community are 'agonizing' over the prospect of having to choose between Warren and Trump in the general election.
'A lot of people in the Wall Street crowd still think the world is top-down,' Wylde said. 'They think the people at the top of the pecking order are still making the decisions or driving the debate, as opposed to the new reality of grass-roots mobilization. They don't realize the way pushback to their criticism goes viral.'
Lance Drucker, president and CEO of Drucker Wealth Management, said he has heard alarm from many of his millionaire clients over plans like Warren's to implement a wealth tax on fortunes worth more than $50-million.
'Honestly, it's only been the last month when people started getting worried,' Drucker said in an October interview. 'These tax proposals are scaring the bejesus out of people who have accumulated a lot of wealth.'
Some financial planners are urging wealthy clients to transfer millions to their offspring now, before Democrats again raise estate taxes. Attorneys have begun looking at whether a divorce could help the super-rich avoid the wealth tax. And some wealthy people are asking whether they should consider renouncing their U.S. citizenship and moving to Europe or elsewhere ahead of Democrats' potential tax increases.
'You're hearing it already,' said Jonathan Lachowitz, a financial planner at White Lighthouse Investment Management, who said he has heard discussions about leaving the country and renouncing citizenship or other legal tax-planning moves because of Democrats' tax plans from several multimillionaires. 'As the frustration mounts and tax burdens rise, people will consider it, just the way you have New Yorkers moving to Florida.'

Age, health come to fore; candidate says he'll be at Oct. 15 Democratic forum 
Sen. Bernie Sanders's admission late Friday that he had suffered a heart attack three days earlier invited new scrutiny of the presidential candidate's age, health and ability to keep up with the rigors of a national campaign.
Sanders released a video hours after he was discharged from a Las Vegas hospital, thanking well-wishers for their support and promising to return ""soon"" to the campaign trail.
""I'm feeling so much better,"" Sanders said, his arm draped around his wife, Jane. 
But neither Sanders (I-Vt.) nor his campaign offered details about how serious his condition was, leaving open the question of how soon he would reemerge and whether voters would lose confidence in his ability to serve as president.
The episode also brought new attention to a Democratic field that is dominated by three septuagenarians: Sanders, 78; former vice president Joe Biden, 76; and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), 70 - each of whom would be the oldest president ever to take office.
""I think anybody's health is of concern when it comes to that high office,"" said Jeremy Dumkrieger, chairman of the Woodbury County, Iowa, Democratic Party, who supported Sanders in 2016 but is neutral so far this year. ""You know, if the person was 40 and was having some issues, I'd have concerns about it, too.""
Sanders headed home Saturday to Burlington, Vt., with no word on how long he would stay there. Jane Sanders said before his release that he would rest a ""few days"" but would take part in the Oct. 15 Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio.
The campaign's decision to wait three days to reveal that Sanders had suffered a heart attack conjured images of Hillary Clinton's collapse in 2016 at a memorial service for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Clinton, at the time the Democratic presidential nominee, had been diagnosed with pneumonia two days earlier, but her campaign did not reveal that fact until many hours after she had fainted.
Sanders aides revealed Wednesday that he had experienced chest pains at a campaign event Tuesday and had undergone a stent procedure to clear an artery blockage. 
After he left the hospital Friday, his campaign released a statement from his doctors saying Sanders was diagnosed with a myocardial infarction - a heart attack. ""His hospital course was uneventful with good expected progress. He was discharged with instructions to follow up with his personal physician,"" said his treating physicians, Arturo E. Marchand Jr. and Arjun Gururaj. 
But Sanders's campaign declined to offer much detail about how serious his heart attack was. On Saturday, the campaign declined a request to speak directly with his doctors about his condition.
Asked Friday why they waited to announce the diagnosis, Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca said, ""We just wanted to wait until he was discharged to give out the information all at once.""
A heart attack occurs when a portion of the heart muscle is permanently damaged from a lack of blood flow, said Quinn Capers IV, an interventional cardiologist and professor of internal medicine at Ohio State University. In an interview Saturday, Capers said, ""The most important thing that dictates how well somebody will do after a heart attack is how much of the heart muscle was permanently damaged.""
Capers said the length of Sanders's hospital stay suggests a small or moderate heart attack, after which patients can live long and healthy lives - though he cautioned that he could not know for sure because he did not treat the candidate.
 Age can also be a factor in recovery, Capers said. 
Health issues have dogged presidential candidates in a number of past elections. After Clinton's fainting episode, detractors spread unsubstantiated claims of underlying illness. 
Sanders hasn't faced the same scrutiny, in part because he's struggling to gain momentum in the Democratic primary contest. Sanders doesn't have a ""strong path to the nomination,"" said Chris Wilson, a Republican pollster. ""So it's less of a story all around.""

In 1999, just weeks before the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, then-Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley underwent treatment for an irregular heartbeat, prompting headlines such as ""Bradley's heart ailment injects health as campaign issue."" Although he'd managed the condition for four years and experts described it as ""more nuisance than danger,"" his campaign never gained traction against the eventual nominee, Al Gore.
The Sanders campaign has sought to project a business-as-usual attitude as the senator takes time away from his hectic schedule. A trio of top surrogates fanned out to campaign in Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire over the weekend. And a $1.3 million TV ad buy the campaign had put off will start Tuesday in Iowa. 
Campaign aides have said unequivocally that Sanders will attend the Oct. 15 debate, but his campaign schedule shows no other events before then.
Capers said that if Sanders were his patient, he would probably recommend seven to eight hours of sleep a night, healthy meals and time for stress release. Getting back for the debate ""seems like a challenge,"" Capers said, adding that if a patient told him he had to be there, he would recommend no additional activity before then.
Sanders aides have pointed to his strong fundraising as a sign of enthusiasm for his candidacy, even as he sits in third place in many polls behind Biden and Warren. Sanders raised $25.3 million in the third quarter of the year, an impressive sum that topped all his Democratic rivals. His campaign said late Friday that it has $33.7 million in his account, a sizable war chest that could sustain campaign operations for months. 
It was unclear how news of Sanders's heart attack would affect his fundraising and his future campaign strategy. Before his heart attack, Sanders campaigned more aggressively than most, if not all, of his rivals. He often held multiple events per day, sometimes in more than one state. 
Whether the heart attack would shift his standing in the race was also an open question. A handful of Sanders's Democratic rivals sidestepped questions about Sanders's health on Saturday. In recent weeks, Warren has been rising in the polls, drawing large crowds and winning plaudits from prominent Democrats. 
""I think she's running a better campaign at this point than Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders,"" said veteran Democratic strategist Mark Longabaugh, an architect of Sanders's 2016 campaign. ""And obviously, Sanders has had a very unfortunate incident that has pulled him off the trail. Biden has been pulled into the impeachment debate. Both demonstrate how unpredictable politics can be and how external events can upset the race.""

A new poll shows voters in the critical swing state drifting toward Trump
It is one poll in one state and therefore not a definitive reading of public opinion. But the latest survey from Marquette University's law school of attitudes in Wisconsin highlights one of the challenges Democrats face as they move steadily toward impeaching President Trump.
The survey was released as the House Intelligence Committee was taking public testimony from current and former administration officials. The testimony offered a consistent conclusion: That the president was seeking help from the government of Ukraine to harm a potential political rival (former vice president Joe Biden) while $400 million in military aid and a White House meeting for Ukraine's new president were being held up.
The testimony was damaging to the president. Yet the Wisconsin survey showed modest but nonetheless perceptible shifts in the direction favoring Trump, on the question of whether he should be impeached and also in head-to-head matchups against leading Democratic presidential candidates. What makes the Wisconsin poll important is that it is a snapshot of a state that, more than any other in the country, could decide the 2020 election.

The Marquette poll found 40-percent of registered voters favoring impeachment of Trump and his removal from office, compared with 44 percent in October. At the same time, 53-percent oppose impeachment and removal, compared with 51-percent the previous month. 
Statistically these are tiny-to-insignificant shifts, but the direction of the changes on this and other questions are consistent. From one month to the next, Republican attitudes hardened ever so slightly in favor of the president. As Charles Franklin, who directs the poll, put it, 'A Republican rally around Trump is very strongly demonstrated in the poll.' 
Meanwhile, Democratic attitudes, while still overwhelmingly in favor of impeachment and removal, softened slightly. Support for impeachment among independents went from a margin of 22 points to a margin of 11 points.
Franklin pointed to another set of findings showing that 42-percent of registered voters saying Trump did something 'seriously wrong,' 9 percent saying he did something 'wrong' and 38 percent saying he did 'nothing wrong.' He called that 'the even split we see in Wisconsin politics.'
The survey was conducted Nov. 13-17, which means it began the day of the testimony by William B. Taylor Jr., the senior diplomat in Ukraine, and concluded after testimony from Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine who was removed from her post last spring on orders from the president. The survey, with a margin of error was plus-or-minus 4.1 percentage points, was completed before this past week's testimony, including that of Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. 
The results from Wisconsin also showed that, since the summer, the Democratic candidates have seen clear slippage in their support in hypothetical matchups with the president. Former vice president Joe Biden led the president by 51 percent to 42 percent in August. By October the margin was 50 percent to 44 percent. The latest poll flips the script. Trump now is ahead of Biden by 47 percent to 44 percent. The shift came primarily from movement among independents, either away from the former vice president to Trump or to a posture of saying they liked neither candidate.
Similar shifts have taken place in matchups between Trump and other potential Democratic challengers. Trump leads Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) by 48 percent to 45 percent. He is ahead of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) by 48 percent to 43 percent after being in a dead heat with her previously. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has risen among Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire surveys, is trailing the president by 47 percent to 39 percent.
Franklin described the findings on Biden, Sanders and Warren as a shift from what was 'a modest, mostly inside the margin of error' advantage for the Democrats to 'a modest, mostly inside the margin of error' advantage for the president. He added, 'That's what you would expect in a battleground state.'
On the electoral college map, Wisconsin might be considered the quintessential battleground state heading into 2020. Its current political culture and partisan divisions are a microcosm of the nation. The divisions long predated Trump's presidency but began to intensify during former Republican governor Scott Walker's two terms in office and more so the past three years. 
The 2000 presidential election saw the state go Democratic by two-tenths of a percentage point. The 2004 presidential elections tipped to the Democrats by four-tenths of a point. Barack Obama proved to be an anomaly, winning the state in 2008 by double-digits and in 2012 by about seven points. After Obama, Wisconsin reverted to its earlier status as a true battleground. Trump carried it by eight-tenths of a point, about 23,000 votes. 
Trump's current approval rating in the state, according to the Marquette poll, is 47 percent "" higher than his national number and about the same as it was in the poll in October. Republicans are more unified behind him today than they were when he first ran for president.
Wisconsin has settled into a rough parity in partisan identification. Where once there was a modest Democratic advantage in party identification among voters, today it is basically even. It is also a state in flux politically, reshaped by the same forces and changing voter coalitions that are changing politics in other states. 
The urban-rural divide has widened in recent years. Rural areas in Wisconsin, as in many other states, have become more Republican, especially during Trump's presidency. Meanwhile, Democrats have made gains in suburban counties in Wisconsin that once voted strongly Republican. 
Counties around Milwaukee still favor Republicans but not by the margins of the past, as evidenced by the midterm election returns in 2018. Walker did worse in his home areas in southeast Wisconsin in 2018 than in his previous campaigns but better in rural areas in the northwest. The slippage in suburban areas has become a cause for concern among some Republican strategists who work the state regularly.
Wisconsin is one of three states of critical importance in 2020, the others being Michigan and Pennsylvania. All three went for Trump after consistently supporting Democratic nominees in a string of elections. If nothing else changes on the electoral map, which is to say if Trump again wins Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Iowa, Democrats need the three northern states to capture the presidency or find substitutes elsewhere.
Of those three, Wisconsin could be the most difficult to convert. All three states now have Democratic governors, but Wisconsin's Tony Evers won in 2018 by a percentage point over Walker; Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer and Pennsylvania's Tom Wolf both won by comfortable margins. Wisconsin's population is whiter than the other two. Wisconsin's union infrastructure, a valuable source of voter mobilization help, has deteriorated, thanks to Walker's assault on public employee unions.
Democrats in Congress are moving forward to impeach the president and leaders have said that constitutional prerogatives, not political considerations, should shape the proceedings. But there will be political fallout, which is why attitudes from Wisconsin bear watching. Much can change in the weeks and months ahead, but the modest shifts in the past month are a reminder to Democrats that public opinion is not currently moving in their direction.

Critics cited Uygur's past statements demeaning women and minorities

MANCHESTER, N.H. "" Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) abruptly retracted his endorsement of controversial congressional candidate Cenk Uygur on Friday, making a rare concession to critics who were angered by Uygur's explicit and demeaning comments about women and minorities in past years.
In a statement issued about 24 hours after he endorsed Uygur, Sanders said: 'Our movement is bigger than any one person. I hear my grassroots supporters who were frustrated and understand their concerns. Cenk today said he is rejecting all endorsements for his campaign, and I retract my endorsement.' 
The move capped an unusual episode that gained attention as Sanders embarked on a presidential campaign swing through the pivotal primary states of New Hampshire and Iowa. It was an embarrassing detour for a candidate who has been gaining steam in the polls, and it caused some frustration inside the Sanders campaign. 
The furor started Thursday when Uygur posted a statement from Sanders on Twitter saying the senator had decided to support the California candidate because 'I know he will serve ordinary people, not powerful special interests. He is a voice that we desperately need in Congress.'
Many Democrats and liberal activists quickly expressed dismay at Sanders's action, and by Friday morning the anger was evident in many corners of the party. Still, Sanders made no mention of Uygur at a campaign event in Manchester on Friday afternoon, where he was introduced by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). 
But between campaign stops, the Sanders team issued the statement pulling back the endorsement, not long after Uygur issued his own declaration that he would not be 'accepting' endorsements. 
Sanders is generally proud to hold fast to his positions in the face of criticism from detractors and sometimes even his own staff. But this time the attacks came not from conservatives or centrists but figures as unabashedly liberal as Sanders himself, and they arose as he and his rivals are battling for support from Democratic women.
'I am tired of misogyny on the left,' journalist and author Jill Filipovic wrote on Twitter after word of Sanders's endorsement spread. 'I am tired of being told I am imagining misogyny on the left. I am tired of being told 'progressive values' mean we have to overlook misogyny on the left. I am tired of gender equality apparently not being a 'progressive value.' '



The Wrap, an entertainment news website, previously unearthed blog posts Uygur wrote years ago, including one in 2000 that said: 'Obviously, the genes of women are flawed. They are poorly designed creatures who do not want to have sex nearly as often as needed for the human race to get along peaceably and fruitfully.'
Other comments were more graphic, and as recently as 2013, Uygur posted crass commentary on Twitter about women's bodies.
Uygur has apologized for his past comments and says he is a different person now, but many liberal activists remain troubled by them. Justice Democrats, a group Uygur helped found to support liberals running for Congress, ousted him in 2017 when the remarks were disclosed.
Uygur has been very supportive of Sanders in recent years, and some Democrats interpreted the endorsement as the loyalty Sanders is often inclined to show to his staunchest backers. 

Uygur has gained a following in recent years through his online news and commentary show 'The Young Turks.' He often attacks Democrats from the left, arguing that they are too timid in standing up to Republicans, an outlook that meshes well with Sanders's. 
'The Young Turks' is popular with many Sanders supporters, and Uygur has featured the senator on his program and covered him favorably. On Thursday, Uygur called Sanders a 'legend' and thanked him for his support. 


Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign faced criticism for not treating some of its female employees well, and the candidate has apologized for that.
The senator is also known for a certain irascibility, but since his emergence from a hospital stay after a heart attack two months ago, Sanders has appeared more relaxed on the campaign trail, and his campaign has scored some successes and strengthened in the polls.
In some ways that made this misstep more notable. Uygur is running in the 25th Congressional District in Southern California, a seat that opened up when Rep. Katie Hill (D) resigned amid an ethics inquiry into allegations that she'd had an intimate relationship with a staff member in her office.
Assemblywoman Christy Smith (D) has jumped into the race for the district north of Los Angeles, receiving the endorsement of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other party leaders, as well as liberal groups including Emily's List.
Several Republicans are also expected to run for the seat, including George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign aide who was ensnared in the investigation of Russian election interference. 
A Pelosi representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday, but others in the party did not hold back in their opposition to Sanders's initial endorsement. 
'Team Bernie chose to endorse an open misogynist,' tweeted David Atkins, a regional director of the California Democratic Party.
The executive board of the Hollywood chapter of the National Organization for Women posted a statement calling on Sanders to disavow Uygur and saying the congressional hopeful's 'hateful and sexist rhetoric has no place within the women's movement or our government.'
The California Women's List, which supports Democratic female candidates who advocate abortion rights, also voiced dissatisfaction, saying in a statement that it was 'disappointed in Senator Sanders's endorsement of Cenk Uygur, a candidate who has repeatedly used misogynistic, racist, and homophobic language. This endorsement appears to go against Senator Sanders' platform and role as a leader in the progressive movement.' 
The backlash prompted Uygur to issue a statement saying he appreciated the endorsements of Sanders and others.
'Their stance took real courage in the face of the corporate media and Democratic establishment onslaught,' he wrote on Twitter. But he added, 'I will not be beholden to corporations, lobbyists, or special interest groups and I will not stand by while those groups attack my political allies. That's why I have decided that I will not be accepting any endorsements.'
Sanders traveled Friday in New Hampshire accompanied by Omar, a member of the 'Squad' of four liberal congresswomen. Three of the four are supporting Sanders.
Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a national co-chair of the Sanders campaign, also withdrew his endorsement of Uygur on Friday. Khanna wrote on Twitter that Uygur had asked him to do so. 
Some Democrats have started to wonder about Sanders's broader strategy when it comes to congressional campaign endorsements. Sean McElwee, a co-founder of the liberal group Data for Progress, asked why Sanders had gone in for Uygur while staying quiet about left-wing candidate Jessica Cisneros in her challenge to moderate Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Tex.).
'What's baffling to me about this endorsement is that there is a progressive woman taking on the most right-wing corporate Democrat in the House who could use some backup,' McElwee said.

Plan would delay making program mandatory; critics see it as retreat
After months of criticism from Democratic leaders and voters, Sen. Elizabeth Warren offered a new approach to her Medicare-for-all proposal Friday, adding an intermediate step that would let Americans participate in an optional government-run health plan before she attempted to pass a mandatory program. 
Under Warren's new plan, which she calls a 'Medicare for All option,' all Americans would be eligible to participate in Medicare, but no one would have to. She would push for this initiative in her first 100 days in the White House, then make a separate effort to pass Medicare-for-all later in her first term.
It's a clear shift for the senator from Massachusetts as she attempts to ward off criticism that her single-payer health plan is unrealistic substantively and toxic politically. Warren for months had signaled a full-throated embrace of Medicare-for-all, and this new approach significantly tempers that urgency.
That may ultimately better position Warren for a contest with President Trump if she is the Democratic nominee. But on Friday it prompted an immediate backlash from her centrist rivals as well as liberal activists.
Kate Bedingfield, deputy campaign manager for former vice president Joe Biden, called Warren's maneuvering 'a full program of flips and twists,' while Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) said she was 'backtracking,' and Lis Smith, spokeswoman for South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, accused her of trying to 'paper over a very serious policy problem.' 
On the left, activists sounded the alarm that Warren's two-step approach could halt momentum for Medicare-for-all, potentially torpedoing that goal. 
'Doing this in stages creates a political danger and an opening for opponents to prevent further progress,' said Adam Gaffney, president of Physicians for a National Health Program. 'The longer the rollout, the more political risk.'
But Warren suggested that her approach was the best of both worlds, providing immediate relief for many Americans without giving up the goal of a universal, government-run program.
'By the end of my first 100 days, we will have opened the door for tens of millions of Americans to get high-quality Medicare for All coverage at little or no cost,' Warren wrote in a Medium post. 'But I won't stop there. Throughout my term, I'll fight for additional health system reforms.'
She said she hopes voters will be able to 'see for themselves' that their experience with Medicare is better than with private insurance, building support for Medicare-for-all.
Experts and rivals portrayed the move as a retreat from one of Warren's highest-profile policy positions on a matter that's of top importance to many voters. Her position arguably now resembles the 'public option' favored by many of her centrist competitors: a proposal that would allow Americans to choose a government-run program if they wanted, rather than the mandatory approach favored by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
'It's much less disruptive,' said Kenneth Thorpe, a health-care expert at Emory University. 'It's in the same spirit as offering a public option.' 
Sanders, accepting an endorsement Friday from the largest nurses union in the country, attacked Warren's approach as a postponement in the fight against a rapacious health-care industry. 'Some people say we should delay that fight for a few more years "" I don't think so,' he said. 'We are ready to take them on right now, and we're going to take them on on Day One.'
Warren's team is particularly sensitive to how Sanders's voters perceive her proposal, since she hopes to pick up their support should he drop out of the race.
'Fundamentally, the question that will prove the wisdom or the failure of the whole calculation is: Is she still close enough' to Sanders?, said one person familiar with the Warren campaign's thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of the campaign. 
'If she's the nominee "" or if people have to decide to rally between one of the two of them "" has she stayed close enough that people think, 'It's not exactly Bernie, but it's pretty darn close'?' 
Medicare-for-all has become a major test for Warren, who has steadily risen in the polls after a rocky start. As her candidacy has gained momentum, she's faced increasing scrutiny over how she'd pay for the program without raising middle-class taxes.
Leaders in her own party have also questioned whether she could withstand attacks in a general election accusing her of eliminating the private health insurance industry and taking insurance away from more than 150-million people. 
Those concerns deepened this month when Warren proposed a $20.5-trillion financing plan for Medicare-for-all, mostly in the form of new taxes. Critics said it would result in a tax hike on the middle class "" something she denied "" while academics said her cost assumptions were far too optimistic. 
Warren's team carefully laid the groundwork for Friday's proposal, reaching out to selected allies, which paid off in some quarters. Ady Barkan, an influential advocate for Medicare-for-all, said the transition plan is 'smart politics and good policy.'
Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who introduced the House version of a Medicare-for-all bill, called it a 'smart approach.' 
Centrist Democrats' angst over Warren's momentum is one reason why former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg is considering entering the presidential race and why former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick recently launched his candidacy.
Patrick, on his first full day campaigning Thursday, contrasted Warren's health-care approach with his. 
'We kept learning as we went, and I think that's what's going to have to happen for any of the big solutions,' he said, recalling how Massachusetts officials expanded health care in the state. 'I want us to have an ambitious agenda. I want that. That is the goal. The means for getting there can vary.' 

Warren's transition proposal is similar to the plan Buttigieg has outlined, which he calls 'Medicare for all who want it.' Under that idea, Medicare would be open to the poor and would provide subsidies to middle-income families.
'This is definitely Warren inching over toward Buttigieg and away from Bernie on health care,' opined Nate Silver, editor in chief of the politics website FiveThirtyEight. 

Warren has provided more details than Buttigieg, saying she would immediately offer free health care to about half the country, including all children and poor families. She would also lower the eligibility age for Medicare to 50 and let young people buy into 'a true Medicare for All option.' 

The person close to Warren's campaign said she had not expected Medicare-for-all to become such a critical issue in the presidential race. In the early spring, all the major Democratic contenders aside from Biden signaled support for it, but a backlash has prompted several candidates to back away.


'It wasn't really clear that we were going to be spending the fall drilling down on the details of her [health-care] plan,' said the person close to Warren. 
'They wanted to make sure they were stapling themselves to Medicare-for-all,' the person said. 'But it wasn't clear that there was going to be much more to it then advocating for Bernie's plan.'

Joe Biden is apparently dropping his long-held opposition to the creation of an outside group that would supply an infusion of money to benefit his campaign, a recognition that financial struggles are becoming a major problem for his presidential prospects.

Kate Bedingfield, Biden's deputy campaign manager, released a statement Thursday afternoon saying that Biden will reform campaign finance if he is president, but in the meantime, he will open the door to outside money.
""As president, Joe Biden will push to remove private money from our federal elections. He will advocate for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United and end the era of unbridled spending by Super PACs,"" Bedingfield wrote. ""Until we have these badly needed reforms, we will see more than a billion dollars in spending by Trump and his allies to re-elect this corrupt president.""
She added, ""In this time of crisis in our politics, it is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to his disastrous presidency.""
Biden campaign spokesman TJ Ducklo declined to provide further clarification on the statement or to comment on why the campaign is reversing what had been a long-held position.
The decision could expose Biden to criticism from his Democratic primary rivals - particularly Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) - who have made fighting against wealthy political interests a centerpiece of their campaigns. 
Both have eschewed the high-dollar fundraisers that Biden has relied upon and instead have built grass-roots donor networks that have fueled their campaigns.
""The former vice president has been unable to generate grassroots support, and now his campaign is endorsing an effort to buy the primary through a super PAC that can rake in unlimited cash from billionaires and corporations,"" Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement. ""That's not how we defeat Trump. It's a recipe to maintain a corrupt political system which enriches wealthy donors and leaves the working class behind.""
The decision is also bound to trigger accusations of flip-flopping, given that Biden has long said he would reject such outside help. His campaign advisers were aggressively opposed to the idea as recently as three weeks ago, pushing back against a Washington Post report stating that the campaign ""has publicly discouraged"" outside help because they felt it was not worded strongly enough.

Biden also claimed credit last year for telling Sanders not to accept outside help. ""I'm the guy that told him, 'You shouldn't accept any money from a Super PAC, because people can't possibly trust you,' "" Biden said in a 2018 interview with ""PBS NewsHour."" ""How will a middle-class guy accept [you] if you accept money?""
The Sanders campaign rejected the idea that Biden had anything to do with its campaign finance decisions.
""No,"" Shakir said in an email, when asked whether Biden told Sanders not to do a super PAC. ""In reality, Joe is the guy who sat there and observed a candidate named Bernie Sanders consistently - over the course of a lifetime - reject corporate money to build one grassroots campaign after another. That's why Bernie is the candidate voters can trust in the White House.""
Biden wrote in his 2017 book that he would have rejected outside money if he had run in 2016.
""It was tempting to play the game because we would be getting such a late start. And for the first time in all my years of campaigning, I knew there was big money out there for me,"" Biden wrote. ""But I also knew people were sick of it all. 'We the People' didn't ring so true anymore. It was more like 'We the Donors.' ""
""And everybody understood that in a system awash with money, the middle class didn't have a fighting chance,"" he added.
Biden allies began meeting weeks ago to discuss launching a super PAC. Those discussions emerged amid dissatisfaction about some components of Biden's campaign, as well as worry that he was being naive about what would be required to counter Trump's attacks while simultaneously making his own case.
Among those involved in the talks have been Larry Rasky, who has known Biden for decades and has worked on both of his previous presidential campaigns; former Biden staffer Mark Doyle; Julianna Smoot, a Democratic fundraiser who led Barack Obama's campaign finance team in 2008 and was his deputy campaign manager in 2012; and Democratic consultant Mark Riddle.
The super PAC has not yet formed, but it is moving in that direction.
""We intend to fight back against the lies and distortions we're seeing now from Trump, his allies, the Russians, and the Republican Party,"" Rasky said in an email. ""While other candidates have groups supporting their efforts, no other Democrat has to fight this two-front war.""
Biden has struggled to raise money, and last week, his campaign reported having $9 million on hand, roughly a third as much as some of his top Democratic rivals. 
In the statement released Thursday, the Biden campaign emphasized the challenge of facing Trump.
""Let's be clear: Donald Trump has decided that the general election has already begun,"" Bedingfield said in the statement, first reported by NBC News. ""He and his allies are already spending [a] massive amount of money on paid television and digital advertising to intervene directly in Democratic primaries with the goal of preventing Joe Biden, the opponent that Trump fears most, from becoming the Democratic nominee.""

ATLANTA "" The top candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination largely sought to speak directly to the American people rather than to draw contrasts with one another Wednesday night, in a wide-ranging presidential debate that came at a critical point in the party's nominating contest. 
For much of the debate, the candidates shied from the biting exchanges and intraparty contrasts that marked the first four gatherings, opening new lines of conversation on issues as disparate as racial justice, marijuana policy and child care. But there were also pointed if brief disputes as the night wore on, some of them focused on black voters, a key Democratic constituency.


The fifth Democratic primary debate, sponsored by The Washington Post and MSNBC, was the first since South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg showed signs of surging in several polls, and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) obliquely criticized him for his lack of support among black voters. 
'For too long candidates, I think, have taken for granted constituencies that have been the backbone of the Democratic Party,' Harris said. 'They show up when it's close to election time, show up at a black church.'
She urged the party to do more to rebuild the Obama coalition. 
'I completely agree,' Buttigieg said. 'I welcome the challenge of connecting with black voters who don't know me.'
Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) criticized former vice president Joe Biden in blunt terms, attempting to peel away the black voters who have been the backbone of Biden's support. 
'Black voters are pissed off, and they're worried,' Booker said. 'I have a lot of respect for the vice president … But this week I heard him literally say that 'I don't think we should legalize marijuana.'
Looking toward Biden, Booker said, 'I thought you might have been high when you said it.'
Biden said that marijuana should be decriminalized but that its long-term effects need to be further studied before it was fully legalized. 
'I come out of the black community in terms of my support,' Biden said. 'They know me.'
Biden also claimed to have the support of 'the only black African American woman had ever been elected to the United States Senate.' It was an apparent reference to an endorsement from former senator Carol Moseley Braun (Ill.), but disregarded Harris "" who, onstage, laughed and shrugged. 
The debate came with less than three months remaining before the voting begins in Iowa, and as the field is growing both larger and more fluid. It also came after a convulsive day in Washington, with riveting testimony in Washington's impeachment hearings extending to just before the candidates took the stage. The event began only hours after U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland told the committee he believed the president used the power of the Oval Office for his own political gain.
Trump has denied wrongdoing and has disparaged several of the witnesses testifying in the probe. Five of the 10 presidential candidates who appeared on the stage are U.S. senators who may ultimately have to decide whether to convict Trump during a trial that could coincide with voting in the early nominating contests next year. 
'The president felt free to break the law again and again and again,' said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). 'We have to establish the principle: No one is above the law. We have a constitutional obligation, and we need to meet it.'
'We have a criminal living in the White House,' Harris said.
Biden chided his party for the chants that have been breaking out at some Democratic events where attendees have been shouting 'Lock him up!' a reference to Trump that echoed the line about Hillary Clinton that Trump supporters rallied around during the 2016 campaign. 
'I don't think it's a good idea that we mock that "" that we that we model ourselves after Trump and say, 'Lock him up,'' Biden said. 'Look, we have to bring this country together. Let's start talking civilly to people and treating "" you know, the next president starts tweeting … anyway,' he said, trailing off.
'Look, it's about civility,' he continued. 'And that's not who we are. That's not who we've been. That's not who we should be. Follow the law.'
Biden said emphatically that he would not order his Justice Department to prosecute Trump, but he held out the possibility that it could do so if the attorney general he appointed thought it was warranted. 
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), in an aggressive debate performance, pointedly stood by her recent comments about a double standard harming the female candidates. She had said that if a woman had the same résumé as Buttigieg "" mayor of a midsize city "" she would likely not be on the presidential debate stage.
'What I said was true. Women are held to a higher standard,' Klobuchar said. 'Otherwise, we could play a game called Name Your Favorite Woman President, and which we can't do because it has all been men.'
She later dismissively referred to him as a 'local official.'

While impeachment is a unifying topic for Democrats, the presidential race has showcased the party's internal struggle over how much of the campaign should revolve around Trump's fate, versus maintaining the issue-heavy focus that led the party's 2018 House candidates to a majority. Within the policy field is a separate Democratic fight, over whether to pursue the sweeping policy changes backed by its liberal wing or embrace a more-moderate vision for bringing the country together after Trump.
'We cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump,' Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said. 'If we are, you know what? We're going to lose the election.'
 For the fifth debate in a row health care was a prominent topic, with the party still grappling over whether it should continue to defend the Affordable Care Act passed under President Barack Obama or aim for a more far-reaching program that would again upend the health-care system. 
It has become one of the most vigorously fought topics, with Warren and Sanders proposing a Medicare-for-all plan that would abolish private insurance and place all Americans under a government-run system. 
Warren, who has released two new parts of her health plan since the last debate, spoke briefly about her new approach to government-run health care, which would open the Medicare program to all Americans before trying to force them. 'When people have had a chance to feel it, taste it and live with it, we're going to vote,' she said, and the country will approve, she predicted.
Sanders chimed in that he 'wrote the damn bill' and stressed that he'd push for a compulsory government-run health-care system in his first week in office. 'The current health-care system is not only cruel, it is dysfunctional,' Sanders said.
But the more-moderate candidates onstage also defended their approaches. Buttigieg said that Americans would not like to be told what to do. 'Commanding people' to go into Medicare, he said, 'is not the right approach to unify the American people.'
Biden used skepticism of Medicare-for-all on the part of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to bolster his own plan. 
'Nancy Pelosi is one of those people who doesn't think it make sense,' he said. 'We should build on Obamacare.'
Pelosi's name was cited several times during the debate, a testament to her emergence as a revered party figure. 
'If you think a woman can't beat Trump,' Klobuchar said. 'Nancy Pelosi does it every day.'


Buttigieg has emerged as a clear primary front-runner in some states, with a recent poll putting him ahead of the pack in first-to-vote Iowa. His opponents began sharpening their attacks on him before the debate even started, with some questioning his experience as a small-town mayor and others challenging him directly over his handling of racial issues. 
 Buttigieg came into the debate fresh from a controversy in which his campaign touted the backing of more than 400 South Carolinians for his 'Douglass Plan for Black Americans,' even if they did not endorse Buttigieg himself. That led some signatories to feel their positions had been misrepresented.
 It also emerged that Buttigieg's campaign had used a stock photo of a woman and child in Kenya to promote the Douglass Plan; the campaign said the image has been removed from its website and apologized for its inclusion.
 Buttigieg conceded that he has struggled to connect with black voters, but noted that he hasn't experienced discrimination because of the color of his skin, but said he felt some common cause with minorities because he's gay.
'I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country,' said Buttigieg. And he was able to watch 'my rights expanded by a coalition of people like me and people not at all like me working side by side, shoulder to shoulder.'
Biden, when asked about being more sensitive to the cultural reckoning with sexual harassment and violence toward women, spoke of how he took advice from college students to 'get men involved, engage the rest of the community.'
'We have to just change the culture, period,' Biden said. 'And keep punching at it and punching at it and punching it.'


Some of the most personal exchanges centered on Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and her biting criticism of the party she is running to represent. 
'Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by and for the people,' Gabbard said. 'It's a party that is a party that has been and continues to be influenced by the foreign policy establishment in Washington, represented by Hillary Clinton and others, foreign policy by the military industrial complex and other greedy corporate interests.'
Harris jumped in and ridiculed Gabbard for her harsh criticism of fellow Democrats, along with her ties with Trump administration officials and her willingness to meet with Syria President Bashar al-Assad.
There also were several moments of levity, with candidates displaying their sense of humor and a familiarity with one another. 
'I raised $17,000 from ex-boyfriends,' said Klobuchar, reprising one of her standard jokes. 
'I don't talk a big game about helping the working class while helicoptering between golf courses with my name on them,' Buttigieg said in a reference to Trump. 'I don't even golf.'

When billionaire Tom Steyer was pressed on his level of political spending, entrepreneur Andrew Yang jumped to his defense.
'We have a broken campaign finance system,' he said. 'You can't knock someone for having money and spending it in the right way, in my opinion'
'Thanks, Andrew,' Steyer said with a grin. 
'No problem,' he said in return.

Now, political organizers are canvassing the state like it's autumn 2020. ""In Wisconsin, we're already in the general election while the rest of the country is thinking about the primary,"" says Democratic state chairman Ben Wikler.
Michigan and Pennsylvania are still vital. Every swing state is. But Wisconsin is a particularly challenging nut to crack, in part because of its uniquely divided electorate and recent political turmoil.

The state generates cozy tropes - cheese, Friday fish fries and Old-Fashioneds (with brandy, not whiskey), Wisconsin Nice and, yes, tailgating at Lambeau Field. But, as with many places, stereotypes crumble on closer inspection. 
The state is rural and urban, dairy farmer and union, and almost equally split between Democrats and Republicans. It elected progressive Tammy Baldwin, the first senator to identify as gay, and avid Trumper Ron Johnson. Despite a state county map that was a blue quilt in 2008 and predominantly Badger red in 2016, ""we've been purple all along,"" says Charles Franklin, director of the state's leading Marquette Law School Poll.
Long a cornerstone of the Midwest's mighty Blue Wall, Wisconsin produced a troika of recent Republican national figures: former RNC chair and Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus, former House speaker Paul Ryan and, most divisively, former two-time governor and two-month presidential candidate Scott Walker, who survived a 2012 recall vote.
As Dan Kaufman writes in his book ""The Fall of Wisconsin,"" the GOP's control of the capital over the past decade transformed the state ""from a widely admired 'laboratory of democracy' to a testing ground for national conservatives bent on remaking America.""
All these dualities make for antacid-inducing close elections, as with the recent races for governor (won by Democrat Tony Evers) and state Supreme Court (conservative-backed Brian Hagedorn). In three of the past five presidential contests, Wisconsin was determined by less than one percentage point. Winning the state requires an intense ground game, many of its 72 counties decided by fewer ballots than the number to clinch a high school election.
Says Baldwin, who secured reelection last year by 11 percentage points, an exceptional mandate for recent state contests, ""Taking a cookie-cutter approach won't work.""
Walker says that Wisconsinites ""respond to authentic candidates."" He says that of the three leading Democratic candidates, he's most concerned about Bernie Sanders winning the Democratic nomination. ""Like Trump, people believe Bernie is fighting for them. His ideas are the most extreme, but he's authentic. He doesn't hide on the substance.""
Congeniality is a matter of pride. There are few places where people speak more about their shared humility. Yet, in the past decade, politics has become a blood sport.
Resentment can be heard across the state. Milwaukee residents and farmers alike are tired of being treated like an afterthought. Republicans are critical of public employees and union members. Those public employees and union members feel battered.
""It's hard to have a polite conversation,"" says Hans Breitenmoser Jr., a dairy farmer in Merrill. ""Wisconsin is just as polarized as other places in the country.""




It's no accident that Democrats selected Milwaukee to host their quadrennial national confab next summer. It's the Mea Culpa Convention. Trump has returned regularly as president, though his love affair with Harley-Davidson, headquartered in Milwaukee, has soured.
During the campaign, millions of dollars are projected to flood into Wisconsin from the parties, PACs, get-out-the-vote efforts, donors in deep-blue states, big money, dark money, $5 checks.
""No one is going to ignore Wisconsin,"" Wikler says. ""You have to come here to win the presidency. As goes Wisconsin, so goes the nation."" (Take that, Ohio.)
His counterpart, Republican state chair Andrew Hitt, agrees: ""We are going to have visits from the president and his surrogates, and more resources than you've ever seen.""
To Republicans, winning Wisconsin is a referendum, to show that 2016 wasn't an aberration.
To Democrats, the campaign is a reclamation project, to prove that Wisconsin remains a bastion of liberal politics.
In Waukesha County, the GOP held a ""week of action"" - in July. The first weekend of November, a brigade of Democratic volunteers knocked on more than 50,000 doors across the state (though not during the sacred Packers game).
The parties here have to navigate a thicket of constituencies. Wisconsin is a union state where unions have been decimated, most notably by Act 10, the 2011 Walker-led initiative that eliminated the union rights of most public workers. Mention Act 10 in many regions and prepare to clear the room. Green Bay teacher Grace Kubeny says: ""My mom dated a guy for 20 years and they're done because of Scott Walker. I hate Scott Walker more than I hate Trump.""
The state is more than 80 percent white. Milwaukee, by far its largest city, is nearly 60 percent black and Hispanic. The metro region, among the nation's most segregated, is home to the predominantly white suburban WOW counties - Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington - that are the linchpin to Republican victory.
Milwaukee and Madison can help deliver Wisconsin to Democrats, as they did twice for Barack Obama - but only if residents turn out. In 2016, this didn't happen in Milwaukee, largely because of a lack of enthusiasm for Clinton and a Republican-sponsored voter ID law that proved a challenge for students, voters of color, the elderly and the economically disadvantaged.
Wisconsin boasts enviable turnout among eligible voters - 69.5 percent in 2016, far better than the 59.2 percent participation nationwide. But it can be a challenge to accurately poll. Clinton led in the pre-election 2016 surveys. Wisconsin has Election Day registration and doesn't collect registered-voter data on gender, race or party affiliation. About 40 percent of the electorate identifies as independent, according to the Marquette poll. In 2016, Jill Stein and Gary Johnson each garnered more votes than the number separating Trump and Clinton.
""Independent"" is often polite Wisconsinese for ""none of your business."" In interviews with three dozen voters, residents identified as ""conservative"" or ""progressive"" and listed key issues rather than offering party affiliation.
""Wisconsin is perhaps tired of the Democrat-versus-Republican label,"" Baldwin says. 
A University of Wisconsin instructor in Madison, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of backlash for speaking about politics as a public employee, said that recent political squabbles have damaged the state's conviviality. ""There is fatigue from all the chaos. Norms have been broken. Families are not speaking to each other. Friends are not speaking to each other.""



""The Silent Majority Stands With Trump"" read signs affixed to the windows of a former Waukesha storage facility in a suburban strip mall, the home of local Republican operations in the party's most vote-rich county. The initial three words - minted by Richard Nixon a half-century ago this week - are printed in sloping pink cursive.
""Republicans and Midwesterners tend to be pretty humble,"" says Waukesha County GOP chair Terry Dittrich, sitting in the operation's Reagan Room, filled with portraits of the former president. ""They keep their opinions to themselves.""
Well, not supporters at Trump's rallies in Green Bay and Eau Claire. But many voters stick to the Wisconsin Nice approach, knowing that family and neighbors may have differing views.
The Silent Majority signs' target audience is clear: Female Republican voters who support the president's policies but not his personal behavior. ""Women's issues are big issues for us,"" Dittrich says. ""Many women voters are willing to overlook some of what might be considered Trump's shortcomings."" So, the local office is courting them early. The next day, the facility plays host to 68 female Trump supporters to watch a three-hour Democratic debate.
 Three years ago, Trump notably underperformed here, collecting 20,000 fewer votes than Romney-Ryan in 2012. (He received a few thousand fewer statewide.) The Trump state director for strategic initiatives is already working out of the office, trying to win those votes back.
In solid-blue Madison, NextGen hosts a debate watch party in a narrow University Avenue storefront decorated like a teen bedroom, walls plastered with cutout images of engaged young people and Sharpied with motivational scribblings. There's pizza, seltzer and cookies, courtesy of billionaire and now presidential candidate Tom Steyer, who pumped $30 million into 10 states to engage young people, before he chose to run for president. NextGen's state staff of 13 has the goal to get thousands of young people to sign pledge-to-vote cards.
On the north side of Milwaukee, BLOC - Black Leaders Organizing for Communities - has trained 16 paid civic ambassadors to canvas neighborhoods. ""We're making sure that people are engaged and know why elections are important,"" Executive Director Angela Lang says of the nonpartisan group.
BLOC has attracted outsize attention, with visits from candidates Julián Castro, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar long before the state's April 7 primary and a donation from Alyssa Milano's get-out-the-vote fund, among others. Next year, the group plans to more than double its budget and deploy a staff of 100. Says ambassador Keviea Guiden, ""It's the black votes that matter in this election.""
In Paoli, outside Madison, Democratic cheesemaker Anna Landmark is engaging rural liberals who feel overlooked and is trying to get candidates to pay more attention to their issues. ""There's a huge enthusiasm gap for progressive communities, as well as a news desert for many of these areas,"" so candidates can't reach rural constituents, she says at her Landmark Creamery. ""People are nervous about talking to their neighbors. Community life has faded.""
To address those issues, the Eau Claire County Democratic Party runs a weekly Thursday-morning coffee klatch to keep voters involved, as well as phone banks two nights a week. The pressure is on in Sauk County, northwest of Madison, a bellwether after correctly predicting Wisconsin's electoral winner in nine of the past 10 presidential elections. With turnout of 72 percent, Trump won Sauk County by 109 votes. 
""When did we start working on the election? We haven't stopped,"" says Tammy Wood, county Democratic chair. The goal is to canvas all 30,000 voters.
Tom Breneman, an Eau Claire brewmaster and former dentist, is a libertarian - part of the 3.6 percent of the state's electorate who supported Gary Johnson in 2016. He's against abortion, which rules out a Democrat, but is no fan of the president or his tariffs: ""It's like a car wreck. It's crazy that he's president. I'm much more interested in local politics."" He doesn't say who he's going to vote for next November but adds, ""I'll probably hold my nose.""
What are Wisconsinites' issues? Health care, definitely. Tariffs on farming and industry, certainly. To Ed Gorell, a former family farmer who is now a milk hauler in Eleva, it's the nation's farm policies, which subsidize corporate consolidation, creating an oversupply that slashes milk prices: ""They basically destroyed my business."" At BLOC in Milwaukee, it's jobs, economic investment, safer communities, schools. Younger voters in Madison? Climate change, gun violence, economic opportunity. Breitenmoser, the dairy farmer from Merrill, is enraged by gerrymandering. At the Packers game, Angela Menehan of Albany says: ""Quit worrying about other countries. We need to take care of homeless people.""
Basically, everything.
Many local political operatives declare their region the key to victory. ""The battle for Wisconsin won't be won simply in Madison and Milwaukee, Waukesha, Green Bay, Racine and Eau Claire,"" Baldwin says, before listing most of the state's eight congressional districts.
Basically, everywhere.
The campaign to claim this state will be long, fierce and punitively expensive.

""I don't know how, following 2016, you could go into this feeling confident at all,"" says Brian Westrate, treasurer of the state GOP. ""Wisconsin could go either way. Anyone who claims different is lying to themselves.""

A mere three hours until kickoff and the Lambeau Field parking lot is a wonderland of bay green and cheese yellow, the weekly Packernalia thronged with truck-bed bars offering potent libations and grills bursting with plump brats and steaks.

This oasis of raucous unity belies the political divide that has made Wisconsin the sizzling center of the 2020 presidential race. A year before the election, many pundits and pollsters have declared that the state could be the tippiest of tipping points - and residents are elated.
All that scrutiny, all that face time, all that glorious lucre targeted on its prized 10 electoral votes.
""All this attention, it's going to be fun,"" says towering Frozen Tundra Man, a.k.a. Jeff Kahlow of Fond du Lac, swathed in grass and foam this Monday night in October, his face daubed with ersatz icicles, crowned with a likeness of Lambeau.
Three years ago, Wisconsin was projected to be a sure thing for Hillary Clinton. As any Wisconsinite can tell you, once Clinton secured the nomination, she didn't campaign here for a single second. Ads didn't air until days before the election.
Donald Trump made constant visits, two to this football-besotted city. He clutched the state by a margin of 22,748 votes, the first Republican to win since Ronald Reagan in 1984. When many TV networks finally called Wisconsin for Trump, that clinched the election.

ATLANTA "" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, in a well-received debate performance, railed against the costs of the government giving too much away. Sen. Cory Booker cast doubt on a tax on the super-wealthy. Outside the studio where they spoke, businessman and former Republican Mike Bloomberg geared up to join them in the contest. 
With voting set to begin in less than three months, moderate Democrats have struck back. Suddenly, they are asserting their influence in a presidential primary long dominated by liberal ideas and candidates one-upping each other with ever more sweeping proposals to enact fundamental changes and dramatically expand government services. 
The debate here Wednesday night served as the clearest indication yet of this shift, which reflects rising concerns among party leaders and voters that Democrats risk losing to President Trump in 2020 if they embrace polarizing ideas. It also underlines former vice president Joe Biden's inability thus far to cement his standing as the moderate standard-bearer in the race, prompting nervous Democrats to give others a closer look. 
'The narrative was, 'Look, the Democrats have been taken over by the liberals and it's the party of AOC,'-' said former Democratic senator Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), referring to liberal Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). 'I think there's been a reaction to that, which is, 'That's not the Democratic Party I signed up for.'-'
The presidential campaign's ideological battle is far from settled, however, with staunchly liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) showing a resurgence since his Oct. 1 heart attack. His improvement has put pressure on the other leader on the left, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), to stand firmly behind liberal priorities as she seeks at the same time to broaden her appeal to more traditional Democrats. 
But efforts by prominent Democrats to nudge the candidates toward the middle have been mounting. Recent electoral victories by centrists in Kentucky, Louisiana and Virginia "" which built on themes that helped Democrats prevail in last year's midterm contests "" have prompted calls in the party to apply their winning formulas to the 2020 landscape.
Former president Barack Obama recently broke from his practice of saying little about the race in public when he issued blunt warnings to the candidates about the dangers of veering too far left.

Some moderate Democrats who initially declined to enter the race have had a change of heart. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick jumped in last week. Bloomberg, a former New York mayor and one of the world's wealthiest people, filed federal papers Thursday declaring himself a candidate. His presence has prompted outrage from Sanders and many of his supporters. 
The tone of Wednesday's debate stood in contrast to earlier showdowns that had more anti-establishment, leftward bents. Where there was once criticism from Obama's left about the former president, Wednesday brought nothing but praise for him, including Sen. Kamala D. Harris's calls to 'rebuild the Obama coalition.' The name of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who routinely has counseled a middle course, was invoked positively. The heated exchanges over highly charged issues such as gun buybacks and decriminalizing unauthorized border crossings that headlined earlier debates were nowhere to be found. 
Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old South Bend, Ind., mayor, has risen to the top of some recent polls in all-important Iowa as he has repositioned in the moderate lane and as an alternative to Biden. He has paired his pitch for generational change with calls for bipartisan healing in the post-Trump era. 
'I'm running to be the president for that day the sun comes up and the Trump presidency is behind us, which will be a tender moment in the life of this country,' he said Wednesday. 'And we are going to have to unify a nation that will be as divided as ever.'
It was clear that several of Buttigieg's rivals came prepared to elbow into the space he has crafted of late. Booker (D-N.J.), who is running on a similar platform, referred to himself as the 'other Rhodes Scholar mayor on this stage.' (Booker also sought to present himself as a strong contrast to Warren when he critiqued her proposed wealth tax.) Klobuchar, a fellow moderate, said that while Buttigieg often says 'the right words,' she has the right experience. 
Klobuchar also challenged some of the ideas Warren and Sanders are promoting, most notably free tuition at public colleges and universities and a Medicare-for-all system in which the government is the sole insurer. 'I am not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car,' she said. 
Warren's maneuverings on Medicare-for-all have provided one of the clearest glimpses of the field's broader shift toward a more moderate posture. After declaring 'I'm with Bernie' in a June debate, Warren faced questions and criticisms about whether she would finance the plan on the backs of middle-class taxpayers and what it would mean for the future of private insurance. 
Earlier this month, she broke from Sanders, releasing a financing plan that she said would not require a middle-class tax hike. She also added an intermediate step that would allow Americans to choose to stick with their private insurance for the first three years of her administration.
On Wednesday, she said her most immediate priority would be bringing down the cost of prescription drugs and protecting the Affordable Care Act that Obama passed in 2010 "" decidedly moderate positions. 
Advocates of expanding Obama care instead of scrapping it in favor of Medicare-for-all, including Biden, Klobuchar and Buttigieg, have become more aggressive in defense of their plans. They have argued for them on policy and political grounds. 
'I don't think we should be trashing Obamacare,' Klobuchar said early Thursday. 'That's not what the people in Kentucky just said or the people in Virginia. They want to build on it.'
She added: 'The American people are watching us right now. And this debate, if we just focus on Medicare-for-all, day after day after day, it's not real.'
On the opposite end of the spectrum is Sanders, who has vowed to push for a Medicare-for-all bill in his first week as president. The current system is 'not only cruel, it is dysfunctional,' Sanders said Wednesday.
Although Obama has not stated a preference in the insurance debate, he has mentioned health care, along with border security and immigration, as areas where far-reaching changes have proved to be tough sells for many Americans and which, if not handled properly, could complicate the party's path to victory. 
His views are both consistent with his presidency and reflective of broader Democratic fears about the danger of the party's nominee being cast in the general election as far more liberal than the nation overall. 
'I don't think we should be deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven't heard a bold enough proposal,' Obama said at a Democracy Alliance summit last week. 'People rightly are cautious because they don't have a lot of margin for error.'
Some Democrats rejected the notion that the center of gravity in the primary is shifting toward the middle. 'I think what the race is doing is deepening,' Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia and a potential vice presidential pick, told reporters in Atlanta hours before Wednesday's debate. 'We are getting more thoughtful information.' 
A rise in centrist energy could have an unintended effect, some Democrats said, by crowding the lane that Biden, Buttigieg and others are competing in and splitting that vote. Such a scenario could clear a path for Sanders or Warren to consolidate support on the left and give them more establishment foes to rail against, those Democrats said. 
'Bloomberg is a really effective foil for Bernie and what Bernie's stood for for years and years,' said Sanders's pollster, Ben Tulchin.
For Biden, the challenge is preventing his vote from splintering off to other candidates running on similar platforms. One major advantage he possesses is his ability to appeal to African American voters, which others, particularly Buttigieg, have struggled mightily to do so far. Several of the candidates made pitches before black voters in Atlanta on Thursday as they sought to shore up their support, a prerequisite to launching a full assault on Biden.
While Biden's partisans denied he would cede any moderate turf, others suggested there were nonetheless upsides to the conversations dominating now.
'I like hearing a practical message because as a local elected official, as a mayor, we have to be pragmatists,' said Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney, who met with Biden on Thursday but who is neutral in the race.

Retail drug prices fell slightly last year for the first time in more than four decades, while the cost of private health insurance grew at a rapid pace, according to an authoritative government study of health-care spending.

The study, produced by actuaries at the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, shows a 1-percent decrease in retail drug prices for 2018 as consumers relied more heavily on generic medicines and prices rose relatively slowly for many brand-name pharmaceuticals.
Still, while President Trump and members of Congress from both parties regard lowering drug prices as a political cause, total expenditures on prescription drugs rose 2.5-percent last year, to $335-billion.
Health spending overall climbed 4.6-percent in 2018 to $3.6-trillion, accounting for nearly 18 percent of the U.S. economy, according to the study, published in the journal Health Affairs. Health-care expenditures amounted to $11,172 per person.
The slowing of drug price increases 'means buyers are being smarter and more sensitive' looking for generic alternatives and other ways to avoid high-priced medicines, said Dan Mendelson, founder of Avalere Health, a D.C.-based consulting firm.
'It's tempting to declare victory when spending growth attenuates,' Mendelson said. But in part because health plans are shifting more of the burden to their customers, 'the polling this year very clearly shows we are in a health-care affordability crisis, and consumers are facing a big squeeze on their finances,' he said.
The report comes as health care remains a dominant public concern in the lead-up to the 2020 elections, with a recent Fox News poll finding that 53-percent of registered voters said the issue will be 'extremely important' in their choice for president "" about tied with the economy and higher than eight other major issues.
Within the large Democratic presidential primary field, a divide has emerged over how far to go in reshaping the nation's health-care system. Progressives, such as Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), favor a broad restructuring that would give the government a far greater role in paying for health services. More-moderate Democrats, including former vice president Joe Biden and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Peter Buttigieg, prefer to build on insurance expansions introduced by the 2010 Affordable Care Act, while giving people the choice of buying into a new government insurance plan.
The health expenditures study shows a continuing contraction of health coverage, with about 1-million more people uninsured in 2018, about the same increase as the previous year.
The study also shows that the portion of health spending that consumers are directly responsible for "" out-of-pocket costs for insurance deductibles, co-payments and other fees "" increased last year by 2.8-percent. That growth was slightly more rapid than a 2.2-percent increase in 2017.
The cost per person for private health insurance rose last year by an average of 6.7 percent, the most rapid increase since 2004.
In a conference call with reporters, Micah Hartman, a CMS statistician and the report's lead author, said a main reason is that Congress reinstated for 2018 a ACA tax on health insurers that it had lifted the year before. He and other federal statisticians and economists could not say exactly how much of the increase was caused by that tax.
The drop in retail drug prices was the first since 1973, federal officials said. 
Richard Frank, a Harvard University health economist who held senior roles in the Department of Health and Human Services during the Obama administration, said the Food and Drug Administration's recent acceleration in approving generic drugs is 'one big thing,' while the price of generics has been falling for years. 
Frank said that the trend contrasts with the fact that emerging specialty drugs 'are going up and going up fast' and are 'the thing everyone is fighting about.' 
In addition, he noted, the study measures the retail price of pharmaceuticals, while consumers tend to pay higher list prices for their deductibles and co-payments.

NEW YORK - There, on the sidelines of a run-through for a show at New York Fashion Week, is a lone figure, dancing and whooping and singing. Stony-faced models file by, but Rosario Dawson, the actor who co-designed the clothes they're wearing from the Ghana-based fashion line Studio 189, is throwing off enough light and energy for all of them.
""You know those charity dances where you have to dance for, like, 30 hours straight? I could totally do that,"" she says, not at all out of breath, before running backstage to give out hugs and motivational speeches.
""I am fa-reaked out! Y'all look so beautiful!"" Dawson tells her runway walkers: kids, grandmas, actual models, friends and bare-chested female dancers in gold body paint. All around Dawson and Studio 189 co-founder Abrima Eriwah is a rainbow of skin tones and gender identities and jubilant patterned fabrics reflecting the collection's inspiration: They called it ""Heritage"" to mark the 400th anniversary of the first slave ships departing Africa for Virginia.
Were Dawson a politician instead of a longtime activist who's dating a guy who's running for president, these would be her constituents. She's doing the Elizabeth Warren selfie line, except she's the one who wants pictures with everyone.
Fantasia was there, along with Jay-Z protegee Young Paris, Black Lives Matter co-founder Opal Tometi, and a packed house of some 800 people. But not Sen. Cory Booker, or ""noted boyfriend of Rosario Dawson,"" as New York magazine's feminist website the Cut likes to call him.
Their first anniversary was Oct. 14, and the year has been a mishmash of convoluted schedules. In September, the senator from New Jersey was prepping for the third Democratic debate in Houston during her fashion show. And by the time he took the debate stage, Dawson was already back in Albuquerque on the set of ""Briarpatch,"" the neo-noir anthology series for USA network that she stars in (as an investigator having an affair with a senator!) and which just wrapped a 3
1/2
-month shoot.
""I laugh because it's like, 'Okay, you're flying and connecting through here. Maybe we can meet at the airport hotel,' "" Booker said in an interview last week, calling in from the campaign trail. ""It has made for great adventures of, you know, making seven hours together be magical.""
Dawson is also working on several social justice documentaries; voicing Wonder Woman in an animated feature; promoting the big-budget movie ""Zombieland: Double Tap""; and working as a board member for Voto Latino, the voting rights organization she co-founded with María Teresa Kumar 15 years ago. Not to mention her personal obligations as a single mother of an adopted teenage daughter and the Hollywood success story in a big Puerto Rican family from New York's Lower East Side.
As recognizable as Dawson is - she's starred as Claire Temple in the Netflix Marvel universe and gets mobbed by fans - it is interest in her relationship with Booker that is currently dominating her story. He's the only unmarried Democratic presidential candidate and potentially the first modern bachelor president. She's the young Jane Fonda of the Afro-Latinx world (or, perhaps, labor leader Dolores Huerta if she'd also starred in ""Sin City"" and the movie version of ""Rent""). They are the rare power couple capable of fascinating political analysts, Hollywood gossips and your mother.
Until now, they've rarely been seen together in public. Instead, Booker has gushed about her on talk shows, and they drop little windows into their relationship on Dawson's Instagram, through cute videos or screenshots of text messages she posted of Booker's buddies congratulating him for having a girlfriend who was a clue in last Sunday's New York Times crossword puzzle.
Tuesday's debate in Ohio is the first Dawson has managed to attend. Booker arrived holding her hand. She stayed until the end, documenting it on Instagram. It seems to be part of a new phase of openness in their relationship.
""I'm in love! I am absolutely in love, and it is so exciting,"" Dawson said last month, while sitting barefoot in a gown on her hotel bed during a 24-hour trip to the Toronto Film Festival.
Because ""Briarpatch"" wrapped in late September, she's been home in Los Angeles and Booker has come to her. He kissed her on the red carpet of her ""Zombieland: Double Tap"" premiere on Thursday.
When the Daily Mail wrote in a headline that Dawson had joined her presidential candidate boyfriend at the premiere of the sustainable agriculture documentary ""The Need to Grow,"" Booker corrected it on Twitter, ""Actually, I joined her.""
""It's just lazy,"" Dawson says in a later phone call. ""Like, I narrate that movie and I'm a producer on it.""
All this togetherness, Dawson says, is just a function of her having some free time. But it certainly can't hurt Booker's flagging poll numbers; he's averaging 1.4 percent in national surveys.
Dawson says she's planning to ride around Iowa in an RV next month with him. ""RV tours are my jam,"" she says. ""I think there's no way of making that happen without quote-unquote 'joining him on the campaign trail.' It's going to show up like that no matter what, but I'm just trying to spend time with my boyfriend.""

Flash back to the 2016 election: Booker was a freshman senator who'd endorsed Hillary Clinton and was a possible VP pick. Dawson was a vocal Bernie Sanders surrogate, stumping for him around the country. She also got arrested in the ""Democracy Spring"" protests at the Capitol, calling for reform of voting laws and removing money from politics.
""I don't know what it would be for, but I could see myself getting arrested again in the near future, if that's what draws people's attention to something. For me, it's always on the table,"" says Dawson, who has said that running for office is on her bucket list. 
Indeed, Dawson was so far left in 2016 that many people believe that after Sanders lost the primary, she voted for Jill Stein. ""No, I didn't!"" she says. ""It's on my Wikipedia and it keeps getting proliferated, but it's not true.""
She was at the Democratic convention, she saw the infighting, she got sad, and mad. And she says she's still upset anyone would think she'd do something to have put Donald Trump in office.
Dawson's mom, Isabel Celeste, also stumped for Sanders and says that when she first met Booker, she told him, ""You know, you don't get my vote.""
But after getting to know him, she's convinced: ""He's young, he's hard-working, he's stoic, he's amazing, he's probably going to marry my daughter and shut the front door.""
It seems as if Dawson and Booker, then, are a case of opposite Democrats attract. Some clickbait-y blind items have circulated on the Internet insinuating that their relationship is fake. If this were for show, honestly, she'd be a little edgy for his presidential brand. Toward the left side of progressive. Has been arrested for social justice and expects to do it again.
And then there's that celebratory video for her 40th birthday that she posted on Instagram this May of herself topless and outdoors, looking at palm trees as birds chirped in the background. She showed nothing but her back and confidence and excellent complexion, and yet she inspired a slew of incredulous responses on conservative media and Twitter wondering whether Cory Booker's ""actress girlfriend"" had gone nuts.
These two seem to take it in stride. She's 40. He's 50. They've both lived public lives for a long time. ""I think that's actually pretty cool,"" says Dawson. ""I don't need to make that legitimate for anybody else.""
Like most couples who've been together for a while, their origin story is evolving. Though Booker has said that Dawson didn't give him the time of day when they first met at a summer 2018 fundraiser for Ben Jealous, a mutual friend who was running for governor of Maryland, he tells it a little differently this time.
""There was no love connection there,"" he says. ""I think it was the places of life we were in. I was probably dating somebody when we first met.""
Dawson's last known boyfriend before dating Booker - the most earnest man in politics - was comedian Eric André, perhaps best known for finding inventive ways to appear fully nude on his Adult Swim talk show.
Then in October 2018, Dawson and Booker ran into each other again. ""I mean, gosh, that night we talked for hours and hours,"" says Booker. At the end of the night, he says, ""I had trouble asking for her phone number. . . . I think I said something really stupid like, 'Uh, how would I get in touch with you?' And she mercifully said something like, 'Oh, you want my phone number?' And my insides were like, 'Hell, yeah!' ""
Was he really the dork he says he was?
""A million and one percent,"" says Dawson. ""He's so charming and so confident and so capable, but it's not like that translates to being some super-smooth kind of guy. That's not his style. What wins me over with him is definitely the dad jokes.""
They live on opposite coasts, but Booker says that almost immediately they started seeing each other once a week. The couple knew that Booker's schedule would become insane once he declared on Feb. 1 and that Dawson's would become immovable once she started ""Briarpatch.""
But then Dawson's dad, Greg Dawson, got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at the beginning of the year, and she oriented all the time she could toward caring for him and flying back for his chemo appointments.
Rosario Dawson says that his tumor has shrunk dramatically and that she's both glad she was able to be his advocate and furious at how byzantine the health-care system is.
Her 16-year-old daughter, Isa, meanwhile, spent most of the summer with her in New Mexico, which didn't leave a ton of time for Booker. Dawson says they went two months without seeing each other. But they've made up for it with FaceTime, which they try to do twice a day. He's gotten in the habit of sending her music every morning, and he just finished reading David Benioff's World War II novel ""City of Thieves"" to her over the phone. Dawson says he's the only partner she's ever spoken to every day, multiple times a day. They both enjoy pointing out that they are vegan.
She calls him CAB and forgets that he doesn't like it when she uses that around other people.
""Not everybody has good initials,"" she says. ""He's my anchor. He's my guy, you know. He's very presumptuous. My initials are R-I-D. But he calls me RIB.""
""Look, both of us, you know, we've had relationships,"" says Booker, ""but I'm not sure if I've ever fully given myself over to a relationship as much as I have with her and allowed myself to be as vulnerable.""
Dawson says that she was trying to explain to a younger cousin how you know you're in love, and she could only describe how she feels about Booker. ""For my whole life, I've always felt like, even when I got into a relationship, I was trying to be the center of the storm and everything was just this maelstrom out there,"" she says. ""But for the first time, I feel like I have someone in the center of the storm with me.""

Dawson was about 7 years old when she started marching with her family for housing rights, homelessness rights, women's rights, LGBTQI rights. Her mother, Isabel Celeste, would push Rosario and her younger brother Clay, who is now a writer and DJ, around in a shopping cart lined with pillows.
""I would have a staple gun and sticks and poster board,"" Isabel Celeste says, ""and they would have magic markers, and they would make banners for people, so they'd have something to march with."" Dawson's great-grandmother and grandmother marched in support of unionizing female garment workers. 
They were a young family; Isabel Celeste was 17 when she had Rosario, who has no relationship with her biological father. When Rosario was little, her mother married Greg Dawson, a carpenter who raised her.
Living conditions grew unbearable in the only Lower East Side apartment they could afford, so they moved into an abandoned building around the corner that didn't have electricity or running water but at least was clean.
Growing up, Dawson was the performer of the family, according to her uncle Gustavo Vasquez, who is a comic-book artist: ""She would dress up like Madonna did with the bows and patterns."" And, he says, she seemed to absorb the creative energy of the artists who were also squatting in their building. Still, no one in the family had ever been in show business, and had she not been sitting on her stoop at age 15 at the exact time director Larry Clark and writer Harmony Korine walked by, Dawson wouldn't be, either.
They asked her to do a screen test, put her in their 1995 film, ""Kids,"" about New York City youths grappling with HIV/AIDS, and her life changed. She still lived at home, though, even after Spike Lee cast her in ""He Got Game.""As an actress, Dawson has always veered toward genre, whether it's because she grew up devouring comic books with her uncle Gus or because those are the roles she's offered. ""I've had indie films where I've either been the lead or a co-lead,"" she says. ""But usually I'm a co-star.""
""Briarpatch,"" her USA show, which premieres in January, may be the meatiest role she's had. It's based on a hard-boiled crime novel from prolific author (and World War II veteran) Ross Thomas. Creepy hotel. Small-town Texas villains who turn out to be terrifying. Exploding cars. Zoo animals run amok. Alan Cumming.
And at the center is Dawson's character, Allegra Dill, a woman from a Texas border town who comes home from Washington, D.C., to investigate her sister's murder. Allegra also happens to be having sex with her boss - a U.S. senator.
Andy Greenwald, the well-known TV critic who adapted Thomas's book into the series and is the ""Briarpatch"" showrunner, says he couldn't believe it when he heard Dawson was interested in the role.
""I feel like people have been asking her to be the lead in a TV show for a decade,"" Greenwald says. ""And she said no every time."" 
Dawson has done an 18-episode guest arc on Jane the Virgin. But she's never had her own series. ""It's the commitment,"" she says. Unlike most TV shows, ""Briarpatch"" is a 10-episode anthology that wraps up Dawson's character arc.
Being No. 1 on the call sheet is a huge responsibility, and Dawson did not take it lightly. The No. 1's mood can make or break everyone's experience on a production. Greenwald says Dawson made a point to be ""relentlessly optimistic and positive"" no matter what was going on with her daughter or her dad's cancer or Booker being so far away - though he did come to the set once, driving three hours out of his way while in New Mexico for a fundraiser.

Back what seems like a lifetime ago, in Dawson's hotel room at the ""Briarpatch"" premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in September, Dawson grabbed a bottle of water and began adding an inky, green substance to it from a dropper.
""Have you had chlorophyll water?"" she asks. She'd been using it to treat her altitude sickness in New Mexico. ""It's the difference between me having migraines and then throwing up or me being able to sleep and function and actually have extra energy,"" she says.
She'd been having a great time in Toronto. The news was getting her a little annoyed, though. She'd told a reporter she wanted to work on voter registration vs. stumping for candidates this election, and suddenly there were articles saying she didn't endorse Booker. A month earlier Page Six had published its third article about how Booker's ""actress girlfriend"" wasn't attending his campaign events. (Dawson posted it to her Instagram with the caption, ""I made it!"") 
""It's important for me to maintain my own space and my own character and personality and career and professionalism,"" she says. No one's accusing Booker of being neglectful if he doesn't come to some of her events. ""I'm like, 'I call B.S. on this.' I don't need to be on his arm to be supportive of him and vice versa."" 
""Both of us are feminists,"" Booker said in a later interview, ""and both of us find it a double standard that they don't ask me the same questions that they ask her. You know, I have an incredibly successful, self-made woman as my girlfriend who is managing a business, nonprofit work, a career. And when she has her big moments, nobody says, 'Hey, where's your boyfriend?' ""
Plus, there'd been reasons, even beyond work and time, that she'd been laying low. She and Booker get harassed sometimes when they go out in public. Sometimes her daughter is with them. She's been in relationships with other actors before, but this is a level of intense scrutiny, coupled with fear, that she'd never experienced before. A pipe bomb, she pointed out, had been intercepted on the way to Booker's New Jersey office last year.
She wants to find more meaningful acting projects, produce more documentaries, maybe go back to college and learn about ""regenerative farming and soil practices to capture carbon."" She'll also continue to grow Voto Latino, which registered 200,000 voters last year and started holding leadership summits.
She and Booker have talked about kids, and are seriously think about it. She adopted Isa at age 12, and together they've grown. ""I feel very much like I checked the mom box in this lifetime."" And as much as she loves babies, ""I don't know that I have to be the one to actually push them out."" 
Still, she finds all the speculating she gets from strangers, and her mother, amusing. ""People go, 'Oh, my God, if you guys became the first family, then you can be pregnant in the White House!' I'm like, 'Slow down.' There's a lot of time between here and then.""
Booker's poll numbers are improving, and he qualified for the fifth Democratic debate in November, but this field is fraught and full.
For the first time in a while, though, she has a little breathing room just to be. 
""We're here and we're thriving, somehow,"" she says. ""And I want more of that. And I want that for the rest of my life.""

Candidate assails rivals, media coverage as he seeks to regain ground

FORT DODGE, Iowa "" At first, Day 3 of Joe Biden's 'No Malarkey' tour didn't stray much from the traditional political script of a campaign romp through Iowa. The former vice president held two town halls, delivered stripped-down versions of his stump speech and smiled for endless selfies. He called one voter's mother to wish her a happy belated 99th birthday, then treated a local family to pie at a neighborhood diner. 
The day culminated hours later when Biden, striking a different tone aboard his campaign bus, unloaded with a searing critique of his rivals and the media covering his candidacy. 
He ridiculed claims that voters were more excited about Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), saying bluntly, 'Tell me where this great enthusiasm is manifesting itself.' And he said Pete Buttigieg, the small-city mayor 40 years Biden's junior, 'flat-out stole' his health-care plan "" a move, Biden insisted, the press would never have let the former vice president get away with.
 'What would you have done to me? Torn my ears off. Absolutely. I'd be a plagiarizing, no-good old man,' Biden told reporters, seeming to allude, in one sentence, to the plagiarism scandal that derailed his 1988 presidential bid and the nagging questions this time about his age. 
The 'No Malarkey' tour, which continues through Saturday, is intended as a show of stamina for Biden, 77, who has fallen behind in early state polls after some shaky debate performances and rising concerns about his strength as a candidate. In Iowa, where the all-important caucuses are less than two months away, Biden was the acknowledged leader when he entered the race in April "" but now he trails Buttigieg and has been locked in a tight race with Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
Then, in stop after stop this week, Biden sought to pump new life into his campaign. He has told voters who braved freezing temperatures and icy roads that he is the most palatable option for a diverse coalition of Democrats, and that he is the best choice to woo Republicans and independents wary of President Trump. His crowds have been small and low-key, a contrast to the more energetic events orchestrated by his competitors, but they present a chance, according to Biden's team, to truly connect with voters in an intimate way that has long been his strong suit. 
'I'm going to say something that I believe to be self-serving, and maybe it is,' Biden told voters in Emmetsburg, Iowa, on Monday. 'In all those states we have to win, I do pretty well. . . . So, folks, I believe I can beat Donald Trump. I believe we will beat Donald Trump. I believe Donald Trump believes I will beat Donald Trump.' 
Venting his anger
But the tour has also at times served as a bit of a release valve for weeks of seemingly pent-up frustration.
After stumbling in 1988, Biden endured another failed White House bid 20 years later when his 2008 candidacy was overshadowed by the electrifying primary battle between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And now Biden has been unable to put away opponents with shorter résumés and, in his view, a lesser chance of defeating Trump..
The former vice president was visibly angry during a tense exchange Thursday afternoon with an Iowa farmer who called him too old to run and then challenged him on his son Hunter Biden's activities in Ukraine, which have been the focus of attacks by Trump and his allies. Biden called the man a 'a damn liar' and offered a defense of his physical fitness.
'I'm not sedentary,' Biden said. 'Look, the reason I'm running is I've been around a long time, and I know more than most people know. And I can get things done, that's why I'm running. And you want to check my shape, man, let's do push-ups together here, man. Let's run. Let's do whatever you want to do. Let's take an IQ test. Okay?'
 Earlier in the week, as Biden's caravan traveled from a stop in northern Iowa to the airport, where he was jetting off for an evening of fundraising in New York before resuming the tour, he invited a group of reporters onto the bus for an unusually expansive conversation. At times, the exchange felt more like an airing of grievances, with Biden waving off staff members who noted he was going over the 30-minute agreed-upon time limit.
'Look at the polling everywhere,' he said in response to a question about Warren. 'Tell me where this great enthusiasm is manifesting itself. She lives in Massachusetts. She's advertising millions and millions in New Hampshire. Why shouldn't she be known there?' 
When it was pointed out that thousands of Warren supporters had come to see the senator recently in Chicago, he became incredulous. 
'Chicago. Oh, great, a great showing in Chicago. Look, guys, you always want to give me numbers but never want to apply numbers to them.' 
A shift to the center?
He said the media's bias toward Warren was evident as she shifted her stance on Medicare-for-all. Warren had embraced the single-payer plan trumpeted by Sanders. But last month, she pivoted to a more centrist idea: delaying the implementation of Medicare-for-all by three years. In the interim, health-care consumers could opt in to a government plan. But Biden said the media didn't fully interrogate Warren about how much her initial Medicare-for-all plan would cost. 
'How many times did the press ask how much it will cost,' Biden said. 'She never answered, because you kept talking about how she's rising.' 
Biden said he felt he'd been fighting against another hurdle: the perception that he was too moderate for a Democratic Party that had become more liberal following Clinton's loss to Trump in 2016. 
'What happened after Hillary. [People said,] 'Guess what, man, the party has turned so far left. So far left, man. And you just can't win, no one can possibly win, not in that lane.' Now, and I was the one, remember all the debates in the beginning, 'Biden is the moderate. Biden's not progressive enough.' '
But now, he noted, other candidates have embraced a more moderate view on health care "" adopting what he called the 'Biden plan,' preserving the Affordable Care Act and giving the public an option to join a government program.
'I said it then, I'll say it again, Medicare-for-all ain't going anywhere, period, because there's a thing called truth in getting there,' Biden said.
The 'No Malarkey' theme, emblazoned in big white letters spread across Biden's blue motor coach, comes from one of Biden's favorite expressions. It's another way of saying 'straight talk,' which became the calling card for similar bus caravans that helped define the political brand of a longtime Biden friend, the late Republican Sen. John McCain.
The tour is an attempt to form connections with a larger swath of Iowans, particularly in rural areas, Biden said. It stretches through eight days and more than 660 miles.
At times early on, Biden sounded hoarse or dabbed at his nose during a taxing long weekend of town halls and small-town pit stops. Staffers kept a glass of water tucked near any lectern where he was speaking. His speeches were short by Biden standards, around 20 minutes or so per stop, a move he said gave him ample time to talk with anyone who stayed after but also offered some respite for his vocal cords.
The electability argument
Biden and his surrogates "" he spent the first part of the tour traveling with former U.S. agriculture secretary and Iowa governor Tom Vilsack and his wife, Christie "" have argued that Biden is beating Trump head-to-head in battleground states that could decide the election. Iowa Democrats, they said, should consider those numbers when deciding which potential nominee could attract general election voters in key states. 
'What about the people who aren't as involved in politics? What about the independents? Who are they going to trust as well?' Christie Vilsack asked voters in Spencer on Sunday night. 'The election is going to be won in the middle. And I want to make sure that I choose the person who's most electable to the widest group of people.' 
Some voters who came to see Biden along the tour acknowledged a concern that a more liberal nominee seemed like a risky bet in the general election. 
'I hear a lot of people saying we need to take this . . . swat to the left, and I just don't agree with that,' said Travis Halm, 29, of Council Bluffs, who came out to see the kickoff to Biden's bus tour. 'We can have a contest about who's more liberal or who's more progressive if we want, but it's not going to do us any good if we're sitting around sulking on November 4 after losing an election.'


On the stump, Biden told voters that Trump's America had failed middle-class and rural communities like the ones he was visiting on his bus tour. There were also lighter moments, like the widely mocked and memed image of Biden nibbling on his wife's finger during her opening speech. Mostly, though, he stressed that he would bring a steady hand to the nation's highest office and foreign policy, and that he'd put middle-class values first. 
'I think we have to very deeply restore the backbone of this country, and by that I mean the middle class,' he said. 
The tour underscored how Iowa remains vital to Biden's hopes of winning the nomination. He has vowed to visit all 99 counties during the campaign, though even after the barnstorming trip, he will only have been to about a third. A weak showing in the Feb. 3 caucuses could affect his strength in two other early voting states "" South Carolina, where he holds a big lead among that state's large African American electorate, and Nevada, where he says he has strong Hispanic backing. If he survives there, another threat looms in early March, when the race turns to multiple big states in a Super Tuesday showdown where former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg plans to make his stand.
Biden, in his session with reporters, offered his analysis of the road ahead "" all but conceding a potential Iowa defeat but insisting that he alone can rebuild the multiethnic coalition that propelled Obama. 
'If I were to come in like some of the polling has shown, you know, like, five points behind, three points behind or seven points behind, I think I survive.' he said. 'I think I do well, because of the depth of the support that I have in the African American [and] Latino community, and there's not anybody so far that has risen to the point where they can all of a sudden everybody in the community can say, 'Whoa. Wait a minute.' Well, there is nobody else that's in there that's in a position to do what Barack was able to do. 
'I just think that we're in, I think even if we didn't do well in Iowa, we're still well in the game in terms of where we are beyond Super Tuesday, where we'll be in South Carolina and Nevada. I feel confident about both of those and I don't see something fundamentally shifting. The reason why it's so important, if the reverse happens, if I were to come in here and win this Iowa going away and then do well in New Hampshire, then what stops it but me?'

President Trump, whose reelection campaign is counting on unstinting support from white evangelicals, mounted a fierce attack Friday against a prominent Christian magazine that harshly criticized his behavior, repudiated his actions toward Ukraine and said he should be removed from office.
Trump's evangelical supporters rushed to defend him, attempting to portray Christianity Today, which was founded by late famed evangelist the Rev. Billy Graham, as an outlier and not representative of the voters that comprise their movement.
But the magazine's unsparing Thursday editorial, which said Trump has a 'grossly immoral character' and should be removed out of 'loyalty to the creator of the Ten Commandments,' clearly rattled the White House and the evangelical leaders who have tied themselves closely to the president.
Trump derided it as a 'far left magazine . . . which has been doing poorly' in a tweet Friday morning, although the magazine is considered far from liberal. He later took to Twitter to tout his record on issues important to the Christian right.
'The fact is, no President has ever done what I have done for Evangelicals, or religion itself!' he wrote.
Beneath the president's angry outbursts lies a fear that, ahead of the 2020 election, Trump could lose some evangelical supporters, who as a group have remained durably bonded to him despite his payments to an adult-film star after allegations of an affair; attacks on war heroes, congressional widows and a teenage climate activist; boasts of sexual assault caught on tape; and the regular use of profanity at rallies from behind the presidential lectern. 
Even a slight drop in support among these voters could be detrimental to the president's reelection hopes, particularly in swing states. An NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist poll from earlier this month found 75-percent of white evangelicals approved of Trump, compared with 42-percent of Americans overall. Evangelicals surged to the polls in key battleground states in 2016 to vote for Trump "" and campaign efforts are already underway to make sure they return en masse in 2020.
But Trump's presidency has reflected a sharp divide among evangelicals across generational and racial lines, especially since many younger evangelicals and evangelicals of color are less likely to support the president on issues like immigration.
Among pastors, political strategists and even the author of the magazine piece, Mark Galli, there was little belief the editorial would be a seminal moment of revolt against the president.
Several White House officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private deliberations, said they believed Trump was bringing too much attention to the editorial in a magazine that is largely read by elite pastors and, according to its publisher, has a paid circulation of 90,000. They said that in their view, he was probably overreacting to the criticism after a long week in which he became the third president in U.S. history to be impeached.
Trump officials were still under pressure to act. The Trump campaign emailed out a statement from Cissie Graham Lynch, Billy Graham's granddaughter, praising the president. It later announced it is launching 'Evangelicals for Trump' at an event in Miami on Jan. 3. 
While the event was already in the works, it was announced Friday to appease the president, who also wants evangelical leaders to come to the White House in January, according to one White House official.
'He's putting a lot of pressure on people because he thinks this is a big deal,' the official said. 
Trump has often weathered incidents that could potentially hurt him with evangelical voters. After the Access Hollywood tape in which Trump bragged about assaulting women came out in late 2016, Paul Djupe, a political scientist at Denison University who studies religion and politics, did an online poll of about 1,000 Christians and found there was no movement in their attitudes toward Trump. 
'I don't have any illusions that because of what I wrote or because it was under the masthead of Christianity Today that it's going to change many minds,' Galli said. 'It's not going to change many minds.' 
Galli said he agreed with many of the president's policy decisions "" including the judges he nominated and his support for antiabortion policies "" but could no longer balance what he viewed as substantive moral failures. He likened the president to a wife abuser who also has good qualities.
Several prominent white evangelical leaders rushed to the president's defense, citing his record and their contention that Trump's impeachment was a politically motivated hit job by Democrats. The Rev. Franklin Graham posted a long defense of Trump on his Facebook page, revealing that his father, Billy Graham, voted for Trump.
Several evangelical supporters of the president described him as an imperfect man who has nonetheless been good for their agenda.
'Nobody thinks Trump is Saint Donald,' said David Lane, an influential evangelical leader who organizes pastors. 'For whatever reason, in my opinion, God raised Donald Trump. Everything he said he's going to do, he's done from an evangelical standpoint. None of the other candidates in 2016 would have done what Donald Trump has done.' 
What has drawn white evangelicals to the president is a sense that he is always fighting for them and against an array of secular forces they detest, said Matt Moore, a former chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party with deep ties in the state. In South Carolina, Moore said, evangelicals support Trump even more than in 2016. 
'A lot of evangelicals believe the current culture war is a zero sum game and their side has to win,' Moore said. 'They see Trump as sort of a Moses figure who is leading them out of the wilderness.'
Trump asked on Twitter whether white evangelicals would ever want former vice president Joe Biden, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), or those of the 'socialist/communist bent' to be their president. He has regularly argued to voters that they have to support him, no matter his foibles, because his opponents would be much worse on the issues they care about.
James Dobson, who founded Christian organization Focus on the Family, took issue with how the editorial did not state who should replace Trump: Vice President Pence or a Democrat? He ticked off more than a dozen issues in which he believed Democrats would be worse than Trump, such as school choice, abortion, Israel, gay rights and 'men in women's sports and boys in girls' locker rooms.'
Christianity Today's editorial is less likely to change hearts and minds as it is likely to help give voice to people who have been silent on Trump, said Doug Birdsall, who is honorary chair of Lausanne, an international movement of evangelicals that was started by Billy Graham. He said he sent the editorial to 500 influential leaders around the world on Friday. Billy Graham's grandson Boz Tchividjian praised the piece, calling it 'well said on so many levels.'
Birdsall, who organized a gathering in 2018 to discuss the Trump era, noted how some evangelical pastors and leaders have voiced their concerns in the past, including Max Lucado, Tim Keller, Peter Wehner and Washington Post columnist Mike Gerson.
'Those who have perhaps sat in silence not wanting to be divisive or political realize there's a certain point where . . . the dangers outweigh the choice of remaining silent,' he said. 'It's morally powerful.'
While most pastors will be delivering sermons Sunday focused on Jesus ahead of Christmas, Birdsall said he thinks the editorial will generate conversation.
'There's a sense that so-called evangelicals have a greater love for Trump than they do for Christ. Evangelicals have become synonymous with Christ. When you think of evangelicals, you don't think about Jesus and the Bible, you think of red hats and Trump,' he said.

At the magazine's small headquarters in Illinois, where about 50 people put out the publication, there were some cancellations Friday. David Sutter, a pastor at York Bible Church in Pennsylvania, described himself as a subscriber 'for years and years and years' but canceled after the editorial. 
But Galli said he has received much support to go along with the attacks. His children were amazed that the president had attacked him on Twitter. He was on CNN nearly every hour Friday, wearing a sweater vest to calmly discuss his piece.
Galli, who is retiring at the end of the year, said he wanted to correct some of the claims in the president's tweet. He said the magazine is not liberal and is not financially troubled, He also said it received a surge in donations and new subscribers, adding that he had not heard from the White House or anyone connected to Trump. 
'It has touched a chord beyond what I ever believed,' he said. 'We have a lot of evangelical readers who are saying thank you, and that's what we wanted to do, to support others who agree and who are saying, 'What you think is what we think.' So they know they aren't crazy.'

When the 2020 Democratic presidential contest kicked off earlier this year, the massive field was hailed as the most diverse in history, with candidates who spanned the ideological spectrum and offered enough in a broad buffet of options to excite any voter. But after 10 months of campaigning and 15 hours of nationally televised debates, another emotion is rising: anxiety.

Party leaders and activists are citing weakness in all of the leading contenders, including former vice president Joe Biden, who has been forced on the defensive about his family's ethics, performed haltingly in debates and set off alarms with his poor fundraising. They also fret that the two other top-ranking candidates, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), are too liberal to win a general election. Other candidates have had moments to shine, but none yet have fully transformed that into anything approaching momentum.
Oprah Winfrey, an early backer of Barack Obama who was initially enthusiastic about former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, has repeatedly begged Disney chief executive Bob Iger to jump into the race. Hillary Clinton, according to two people close to her, has not ruled out jumping in herself, a sign that she is hearing similar dissatisfaction. 
""You can imagine much stronger candidates,"" said Elaine Kamarck, a Democratic National Committee member. She pines for Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who declined to run, or an outsider such as retired Adm. William H. McRaven, who oversaw the 2011 raid that killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
John Coale, a major donor to both Bill and Hillary Clinton, was more blunt. ""They don't have anybody who can win the general [election],"" he said. 
In conversations with 17 state and national party leaders, nearly all expressed some level of unease with where the field stands and a deepening concern that, even as Trump suffers through one of the darkest phases of his presidency, the leading presidential contenders would struggle mightily in a one-on-one contest with him. For all of his challenges, Trump commands a gigantic operation that has vacuumed up unprecedented sums of money, an unparalleled megaphone to lure in voters and a lock on most of the Republican Party. Democrats face the possibility of a long primary fight that could cleave the party along ideological and generational lines and leave the nominee campaigning against an incumbent whom Democrats see as simultaneously weak and hard to beat.
The unpredictable nature of the race so far has contributed to Democrats' unease. Candidates who at first seemed to combine crowd-pleasing star power with center-left appeal, such as O'Rourke and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), faded quickly. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has commanded attention on the debate stage but been unable to appeal to black voters, a concern underscored Tuesday by a leaked memo detailing a focus group of black South Carolina voters who expressed discomfort with him being gay. 
Others moderates, such as Sens. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Michael F. Bennet (Colo.) and Gov. Steve Bullock (Mont.), linger toward the bottom of the polls. 
That has helped propel speculation about Hillary Clinton, the 2016 party nominee, although aides say the likelihood of her seeking a rematch with Trump remains slim. Those close to Clinton, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on her behalf, say she has felt vindicated over the past few weeks as Trump's political difficulties have deepened. That sentiment was reinforced this week when the State Department announced its probe into emails sent to a private server, a major complication of her 2016 campaign, found no evidence of deliberate mishandling of classified information by department employees
. 
""Ultimately, it's unlikely she would do it,"" said one person who has spoken with her. ""But put it this way: It ain't zero. And does she think about it all the time? Absolutely.""
Allies have passed around an op-ed that appeared in the San Francisco Chronicle, written by former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown, with the headline, ""Who should run against Trump? How about Hillary Clinton?"" 
Supporters say she has been glued to the Democratic primary contest and has spoken with some frequency with Warren and Biden, among others. Now selling a book written with her daughter, Chelsea, she has been a constant public presence of late, engaging in a days-long spat with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and repeatedly trolling Trump on his favorite communications platform, Twitter. 
A late entrance under any circumstances would be difficult, with Clinton's former aides and fundraising network dispersed among many current campaigns. But her supporters have discussed whether she could helm a slimmed-down campaign operation and whether she would be able to maintain the less cautious, more freewheeling persona she has adopted since her loss in 2016. 
""Her view is: I ran against this guy, I know how to do this,"" said one of those close to her. ""She has battle scars to prove it.""
The chatter has made it out to the campaign trail. Asked about Clinton by reporters at a Des Moines high school on Monday, Warren parried: ""Do you have a question about education?"" Asked later what role Clinton should play in 2020, she replied, ""I do not have any comment on that."" 
Views about Clinton vary widely, however, and in part mirror the ideological and generational schisms that have fed the current anxiety. More seasoned leaders who have seen Democrats lose big have tended to prefer a safer, middle-road candidate more palatable to a wide range of voters. Those newer to the process are attracted to the vibrant and passionate candidates who can entice the base.
The push for liberal purity is one that raises warning flags for the Rev. Joseph A. Darby Jr., an influential black pastor in South Carolina. He said he fears a repeat of the ""McGovern situation,"" referring to the 1972 presidential election that pitted liberal Sen. George McGovern against incumbent Republican Richard Nixon. 
He ""was the great white hope,"" Darby said. ""He was the one that everyone went with because he was so wonderfully progressive, and he got his butt beat at the polls. I don't want to see a repeat of that.""
But he's also bothered by Biden's poor fundraising. 
""I don't know if it's a lack of hustle or what, but it's a concern,"" Darby said. ""Running for office ain't cheap these days."" 
Some of the more moderate and lower-polling candidates, such as former Maryland congressman John Delaney, fault the Democratic National Committee for creating a system in which candidates who are already well known or have base-pleasing views have a massive advantage. 
The party set a high threshold for grass-roots donors that candidates had to meet to make it on the debate stages, an incentive system that he said rewards far-left views. 
Moderate candidates lose out if the DNC process trumps the traditional vetting role that voters in Iowa and New Hampshire have long played, he said. 
Biden, he said, hasn't offered enough new ideas for younger Democrats to embrace him. And Sanders and Warren, he said, are too far to the left to win. 
""You need to run on things that half the country agrees with you,"" he said.
A key problem with many candidates, particularly the liberal ones, according to nearly all of the party leaders interviewed, is their support for ending the private health insurance industry via a Medicare-for-all plan. 
Kamarck, the DNC member, said it's a ""trap"" in which Warren, in particular, now finds herself stuck. 
Warren has been criticized for weeks for refusing to say how she'd fund the massive program, eventually saying Sunday that she would release a detailed funding plan in the next few weeks. But the next day she remained uncomfortable discussing Medicare-for-all - insisting five times that reporters should focus on her education plan.
Warren, whose stock has risen more than any other candidate this year, growing steadily as Biden, Sanders and Harris have faltered, also faces a renewed challenge from the left. Her main competition on that front, Sanders, has revived his campaign since suffering a heart attack three weeks ago, posting impressive fundraising numbers and hosting the biggest rally of the election cycle, featuring an endorsement from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). 
As she works to build a national campaign, Warren also has faced criticism from Iowa Democrats concerned about her absences.
""I don't know what her strategy is. I don't know why she's not here, but people have noticed,"" said Steve Drahozal, the chairman of the Dubuque County Democratic Party, who said he has appealed to the Warren campaign several times for the candidate to visit.
Buttigieg is matching Warren's formidable ground game in Iowa, according to county Democratic chairs. Klobuchar also has increasingly pinned her campaign on a strong showing there. 
A USA Today/Suffolk poll this week showed Biden and Warren tied in Iowa, with Buttigieg a few points behind, feeding worry among party leaders that the race could remain unsettled for a long while, as Trump whales on the Democratic field. Coale and others raised the prospect of an undecided convention, which he likened to ""a Geraldo show where chairs are flying.""

Other seasoned party hands noted that it's normal for Democrats to fret.
""Democrats characterologically worry about everything,"" said Steven Grossman, a former Democratic Party chairman who is supporting Buttigieg. ""We have that quality and characteristic, but I'm not one of those people. I believe that whoever emerges from the primary process will be battle tested.""

Advisers say move is not an official signal he'll seek Democratic nod
Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg filed federal papers Thursday declaring himself a Democratic candidate for president, a potentially disruptive move that could upend the party's nomination fight this spring. 
The filing, coming just eight months after Bloomberg ruled out a bid because he believed it would be too hard to win the Democratic nomination, reflects his view that the field of Democratic contenders was not well positioned to win next year and that a candidate with his experience, political moderation and deep pockets would have a better chance of defeating President Trump in a general election. 
Advisers said Thursday that the filing was a step toward running for president, following several state ballot registrations, but not an official announcement or public signal that he had made a final decision. An adviser said the timing of the filing was triggered by his earlier application for a spot on the Alabama ballot.
But Bloomberg's team has been moving swiftly over the past two weeks to rebuild a presidential campaign operation that was scuttled after he decided earlier this year not to run.
 One of the world's richest men, with a net worth estimated by Forbes to be $53-billion, Bloomberg is positioned to be a force to counter the candidates who emerge from the first four nominating contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. In defiance of the traditional nominating calendar, Bloomberg has planned to skip those contests to spend heavily in states that will vote in March "" including California, Texas and 12 other states that will award delegates on Super Tuesday. 
As the other candidates focus on the early states, Bloomberg has looked at building his organization in more delegate-rich states while also spending $115-million or more on ads and voter registration efforts targeting Trump in states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania that are likely to be crucial in the general election.
His bid would be built around his effectively bottomless pockets, since no presidential campaign has ever come close to spending the resources at Bloomberg's disposal. His advisers expect to work without a preset budget or any outside fundraising efforts, a fact that will bar him from participation in the December party debates, which require candidates to meet a donor threshold. 
'This is going to be a unique campaign, with a real focus on grass-roots organizing making sure people are on the ground engaging with voters and engaging with citizens, at the same time investing in paid media and an unprecedented digital strategy,' said Bloomberg's likely campaign co-chair, Stephen Benjamin, who is the mayor of Columbia, S.C., and has been working with the team planning a potential campaign.
Bloomberg's longtime advertising strategist, Bill Knapp, has signed on to work on the campaign. Mitch Stewart, a senior field organizer for both of Barack Obama's presidential campaigns, has been tapped to plan ground operations, marking an early decision to build an operation that reaches beyond television and digital advertising. 
Stewart suggested that the strategy will build on relationships Bloomberg has already formed through his philanthropic efforts with mayors, environmentalists and gun-regulation activists, among others. 
'Mike can uniquely build a robust infrastructure across the country, fueled by activists who have worked on issues with Mike for literally decades,' Stewart said. 
Bloomberg, 77, is the financial backer of one of the largest standing grass-roots political efforts in the country to push for more gun regulation. 
His groups "" Moms Demand Action, Students Demand Action and the Everytown Survivor Network "" boast hundreds of local chapters with representation in every state. The groups made more than 100,000 phone calls and knocked on tens of thousands of doors this fall in Virginia to help elect Democrats in the state legislature, according to advisers.
'Our volunteers will come out and support him,' John Feinblatt, who oversees Bloomberg's gun efforts, said when asked about a possible campaign. 'As he travels around the country, you can expect them to show up.'
Bloomberg will also draw on extensive work funding mayoral efforts around the country. Benjamin, who was a prominent backer of Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016, is an alumnus of a training program for mayors that Bloomberg funds with Harvard University. 
Another likely co-chair of the campaign, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, has won competitive grants for his city from Bloomberg Philanthropies. 
'I can't tell you how many times I hear about people who want to vote for a Democratic nominee but they are afraid of a Democratic nominee being too far to the left,' Fischer said. 'So his name comes up.' Both have endorsed Bloomberg's presidential ambitions. 
But Bloomberg's campaign will face fierce early head winds from a party electorate that has shown skepticism in recent years toward self-funding candidates and those with close Wall Street ties. Born in Medford, Mass., to a family of modest means, Bloomberg made his money selling information technology to bankers, traders and others in the finance industry.
For much of his political career, he was a Republican, registering as an independent in 2007 and rejoining the Democratic Party in October 2018. As mayor of New York, he endorsed President George W. Bush's reelection in a speech at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York. In 2016, he spoke at the Democratic nominating convention with a speech warning of a Trump presidency.
Bloomberg has been critical of Democratic proposals for a Medicare-for-all system that would effectively end private insurance. He has publicly lobbied against Trump's trade war with China, where his company does business, as a job-killing mistake. He has supported increases in income-tax rates for the wealthiest Americans but has dismissed as probably unconstitutional the proposal by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) for a wealth tax on the assets of billionaires such as himself.
 'We need a healthy economy, and we shouldn't be embarrassed about our system,' he said on a February visit to New Hampshire. 'If you want to look at a system that's noncapitalistic, just take a look at what was perhaps the wealthiest country in the world, and today, people are starving to death "" it's called Venezuela.'
Bloomberg attempted to address his greatest vulnerability with the key Democratic demographic of black voters Sunday, when he apologized for the mayoral policy that allowed New York police to stop and frisk people simply for appearing suspicious. The policy disproportionately targeted black and Latino residents.
'Today, I want you to know that I realize back then, I was wrong,' Bloomberg said at a predominantly black megachurch in Brooklyn.
In recent years, Bloomberg has been one of the biggest donors to federal elections, to liberal groups such as Planned Parenthood and to an effort to close coal-fired power plants with the Sierra Club. He has also been a major backer of smoking-cessation efforts around the world.
In 2016, Bloomberg pollster Doug Schoen produced projections that showed the former mayor with a clear shot at winning an electoral-college majority in a three-way contest against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Trump, largely by winning pluralities in swing states such as Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina. Schoen found a three-way contest with Trump and Clinton more difficult. 
Ultimately, Bloomberg opted not to run for president on a third-party ticket in 2016, because he said he feared he would risk Trump's election. In March, Bloomberg ruled out a separate campaign for the Democratic nomination because he said he was 'clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field.'
But Bloomberg has long boasted of having a historically high tolerance for political risk. In an interview in November 2018, he recalled fondly the steep odds he faced when he was considering his first run for New York mayor, as a Republican.
Schoen predicted Bloomberg would get only a third of the vote. But Bloomberg ran anyway, spending $74-million on a campaign that concluded shortly after the 9/11 attacks. He won with 50.3-percent of the vote.

Perhaps the great unknown of 2020 is how the tenor of the Democratic nomination contest will affect the general election. The outcome of the primaries and caucuses, of course, is far from clear - the nominee may ultimately lean to the center or the left - but what is clear is that the party has shifted in fundamental ways since the last presidential election. You can see it in the policy positions being discussed and embraced by Democrats, many of which go well beyond the positions taken by previous Democratic presidents and nominees - from banning private insurance to free college to a wealth tax to the Green New Deal. You can see it in the left-populist worldviews and solid poll numbers of two of the three leading candidates, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. And you can see it in the substantial popularity among the Democratic rank-and-file of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her allies in Congress. In this issue of the magazine, journalists, wonks, activists and politicians - from a variety of ideological perspectives - reflect on how all of this might play out in the months and years to come, and how Americans should feel about it. - Richard Just

 

It's about time Democrats moved left


By Brittney Cooper

Since 2011, we have watched a spate of social movements - the Arab Spring, SlutWalk, Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, the Women's March and #MeToo - remind Americans of how essential protest is to shoring up the integrity of democratic politics. If you understand the history this way, Democrats have taken a decade to arrive at what has by all accounts been a pretty raucous party, what with flesh-baring feminists demanding sexual autonomy, young black folks fighting the power again, and radical white kids mad as hell about capitalism robbing them of their American Dreams. To the Democrats' credit, they have made a fashionably late entrance, bringing the power of formal and established American politics to a table set by those who usually, to paraphrase Shirley Chisholm, have to bring their own chair.
When we ask the question of whether Americans will follow, it begets for me a different question: Which Americans do you mean? Young Americans of all races, and especially those of color, have been sounding the death knell of capitalist excess since they formed the first encampments in New York's Zuccotti Park. When we see presidential candidates laying out policies and affirming their belief in reproductive justice, reparations and Medicare-for-all, this leftward shift is the direct result of the leadership of 21st-century rabble-rousers and dissenters. The question of whether Americans will follow really asks whether older generations, baby boomers in particular, will get on board with a vision that fundamentally challenges their belief in the myth of American meritocracy - that if you work hard, you can have everything you want. The country simply does not work that way for undocumented folks, for black folks, for the poor, or for trans people.
Do I believe Americans will follow? Americans like me - first-generation college kids, 40-year-old xennials squeezed by the care-taking of children and elders, and those mortified by the persistence of patriarchy, our brazen return to violent white nationalism and our swift if predictable descent into fascism - absolutely will. It's the only way to a future in which we all get to live and thrive.

The left isn't making it easy to vote Democratic

By Linda Chavez

For conservatives like me who are alarmed at President Trump's unprecedented assaults on the Constitution, the unthinkable has become a near imperative. For the first time since 1968, when I voted for Vice President Hubert Humphrey, I may cast a vote for a Democrat for president. In the last election, I wrote in my own Republican preference - Marco Rubio - but this time, the stakes are simply too high to throw away my vote. The Democrats aren't making my choice easier.
The Democratic Party's lurch to the left will undermine what should be a chance to win against a deeply unpopular president. Trump has exploded the national debt and is running deficits unheard of outside major wars. But Democrats' plans for trillions of dollars in spending on everything from climate change to free college to expanded Medicare-for-all with no way to pay for it is a turnoff for voters who wouldn't think of buying a bigger house or a new car if they couldn't afford it. Yet perhaps the biggest problem for Democrats is cultural: They are tone deaf when it comes to the values that matter to many religious and socially conservative voters, including significant numbers of Latinos and blacks.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren's snarky reply at a recent debate about what she would tell a faith voter who believes marriage should be between one man and one woman was a case in point: ""I'm going to assume it's a guy who said that. And I'm going to say, 'Then just marry one woman,' '' she said, capping off with, ""assuming you can find one."" Beto O'Rourke upped the ante, saying his administration would take tax-exempt status away from churches and organizations that did not recognize same-sex marriage. On abortion, even Joe Biden, who previously opposed government funding of abortions, has changed his stance in the face of the Democratic Party's uncompromising opposition to any restrictions on the procedure. These positions may be popular in Democratic primaries, but come November 2020, they could help ensure Donald Trump's reelection.

Rural Americans will welcome this shift

By Elizabeth Catte

On an electoral map, I live in Staunton, Va., a dot of blue in a sea of red - a small city surrounded by a large rural county that should be, according to conventional political wisdom, filled with the kind of unexciting, middle-of-the-road voters that Joe Biden dreams of and the centrist wing of the Democratic Party mythologizes. Our local Democratic candidates, hampered by gerrymandering, lose gracefully to their Republican rivals. Our assistance to the Democrats in state and national elections is reliable but delivered in modest numbers. We are the kind of people the party likes to seek donations from but never listen to. We are folks who know our place.
Except in 2019, our local Democrats decided to write their own platform, to step up and articulate a vision amid what to them felt like an absence of coherent principles and values from the national party. As working issues, their platform included the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, divestment from fossil fuels, universal health care, total student loan forgiveness and the repeal of right-to-work laws. Their collective direction on more than 60 issues covered by the new platform puts our local organization squarely to the left of both the state and national party, as well as many of the current primary candidates. It was adopted by a unanimous vote.
Nationally, with an eye toward 2020, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are the best hope for the left on the narrow electoral terms through which they might succeed. They will face a dangerous terrain where voter apathy will collide with voter suppression and modern misinformation campaigns from the right. Godspeed to them both. But ordinary Americans, not elected representatives or political parties, are at the forefront of progressive politics in the United States. If the Democrats are moving left, it is because they are following, not leading.

The necessity and political savvy of the Green New Deal

By Bill McKibben

On climate change, the party is not moving left - it's moving to where the populace is, especially those segments of it under the age of 40. The polling shows a spiking level of concern, which is about what one would expect in a nation ever more buffeted by the effects of rising temperatures. No one who watched a city literally called Paradise turn into hell last year has forgotten those images; the farmers who endured the wettest year in American history and couldn't get tractors into the field know better than most how fast the world is changing.
And they all know how little the government has done to face this crisis. In fact, some surveys show that President Trump and the Republicans are more out of touch with popular sentiment on the environment than on anything else.
That's why all the thinking that falls under the general rubric of the Green New Deal is so smart. It understands the climate crisis as a lens through which to view the world - a chance to address not only its rising temperature but the rising inequality that roils our politics. If your own life is insecure, it's harder to imagine change of the kind we need to deal with this moment. Ideas like a federal job guarantee for anyone who wants to help with the renewables transition are important precisely because they give people a chance to get their feet on the ground.
It all comes with political danger, of course. If the history of the past 30 years teaches us anything, it's that those in the fossil fuel industry will do all they can to defend their business model, and since they more or less own one of our political parties, expect endless diatribes about taking away your hamburgers. Up against the growing press of flood and fire, however, I think and hope they'll fail.

For the lockdown generation, it's about lives - not left or right

By Emma González

Young Americans have plenty of reasons to be scared, anxious and mad as hell. Adults and elected officials have done basically nothing to address the gun violence in our country, and the problems we face are only getting worse. Our country's addiction to guns has created a culture of violence that has taken the lives of far too many - nearly 40,000 in 2017, the most recent year for which complete data is available, and the highest annual total in 50 years. It has touched not only my community, but communities everywhere.
Many have called our generation the lockdown generation, but this problem has existed long before us. However, it is up to us to elect people who value life over politics. We aren't looking for someone on the left or on the right; we are looking for someone who will help us move forward. Our generation has lost its childhood due to gun violence and injustice. We have grown up afraid to exist. Yet, in our fear and our anger, we find strength and the courage to fight. While our innocence has been lost to unspeakable violence and ever-deepening grief, we haven't lost our ability to speak up and speak out.
Our power comes from knowing that our voices and our votes have shifted a narrative and a nation to bring needed change at local and national levels. In response to an epidemic of gun-related suicides and mass shootings, March for Our Lives wrote ""The Peace Plan for a Safer America"" - a comprehensive plan to cut gun violence deaths in half in 10 years. Twenty thousand lives could be saved annually.
Each day is a march. Each day is our chance to be heard and to stand for our rights. We deserve to live free of fear. We deserve to live free of gun violence.

Emma González is a co-founder of March for Our Lives.

The far left is too pessimistic about the American Dream

By Avik Roy

If you spend a lot of time watching cable news, it's easy to conclude that Americans are hopelessly divided about what our country stands for. But we're actually deeply united on a fundamental American principle: the principle of equal opportunity for all. Bill Clinton used to say, ""If you work hard and play by the rules, you should be given a chance to go as far as your God-given ability will take you."" Ronald Reagan said, ""The American dream [is] that wealth is denied to no one, that each individual has the right to fly as high as his strength and ability will take him."" It's no accident that both Clinton and Reagan were popular two-term presidents.
One of the major differences between the far left and the rest of the country is that the far left is deeply pessimistic about the state of equal opportunity. A survey by a group called More in Common found that 54 percent of Americans agreed that ""people who work hard can find success no matter what situation they were born into."" By contrast, just 5 percent of ""Progressive Activists"" - the poll's most left-leaning respondents - agreed with this statement.
It's not surprising that some Democratic presidential contestants reflect this pessimism. There remain inequalities of opportunity, such as the persistence of poverty among African Americans, and the decreasing affordability of health care, housing and college.
But hard work still succeeds in America. There are 1.4 million more job openings in America than there are unemployed people. American entrepreneurs have given us access to previously unimaginable goods and services, and our political leaders can open up more areas for innovation.
Voters have always rewarded politicians of both parties who have faith in the American Dream. This was true in 1980, it was true in 2008, and it will be true in 2020.

Only progressive economics can stop future Trumps

By Dani Rodrik

Somewhat less than a third of likely voters say they will support President Trump in the 2020 election regardless of the Democratic Party nominee, according to the annual American Values Survey, conducted in recent months by the Public Religion Research Institute. This leaves more than two-thirds of the electorate up for grabs.
Whether progressive candidates on the left - Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders - can claim a large enough share of these potential swing voters will depend less on inherent ideological predispositions than on the framing of the policy issues. True, the term ""socialism"" evokes mostly negative connotations among Republican-leaning voters. At the same time, according to the PRRI survey, nearly half (47 percent) of Republicans think ""progressive"" describes them somewhat or very well. And health care and jobs are two of the top three critical issues for uncommitted Americans. (The other is terrorism.)
Academic studies show that the disappearance of good jobs and attendant economic anxieties are key drivers behind the rejection of centrist politicians at the polls in both the United States and Europe. The areas of the country that went for Trump in 2016 after having voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 lagged significantly behind the rest of the country in expanding employment and economic opportunity. Their relative position has continued to deteriorate in the first two years of Trump's administration.
Trump won in those ""flipped counties"" by wrapping a nativist narrative around their residents' discontent. A progressive Democratic candidate would instead offer remedies that directly treat the causes - by redressing fundamental power imbalances in the economy and through public investment in education, social programs, infrastructure and job creation financed by more-progressive taxation.
The choice that the Democratic Party faces is this: It can treat Donald Trump as an aberration and prop up an economic regime that reproduces the status quo ante with cosmetic fixes. Or it can treat Trump as a symptom of an unsustainably unjust economic system that needs to be reformed at its core. Only the latter path will prevent the emergence of future Trumps.

Americans want a break from chaos - but also something more

By Marcia Davis

As a journalist, I'm not in the prediction business. It's too early to say what will happen in the Democratic nomination contest. Yet here is what I do know: American voters want more.
Even those folks who are supporters of President Trump want more, whether they know it or not. And I'm not talking about those folks who would like black and brown people, and others of color, to float away. I'm talking about the salvageable people. And there are more than a few, including those folks who voted for Trump on the down low.
The president's chaotic leadership style is exhausting. In some ways, this impeachment business is representative of that fatigue. We see the U.S. House of Representatives is gearing up to send articles of impeachment to the Senate, but I'm not anticipating a vote for his removal.
People who will be voting Democratic - including some independents, some ""Never-Trumpers"" and dyed-in-the-wool Dems - will be voting for a breather, a chance for calm. They want a break from all the chaos.
But many Democratic voters want more. They're looking for real help on health-care costs. Opportunity and job training. Immigration reform. Some help on education. And women's equality. (It's time, too, for a female president.) More effort on criminal justice. Real work on climate change. And they'd like some restoration of the country's international reputation.
Will Americans follow the Democratic Party's shift to the left? Yes. The question is just how much of a shift we are talking about. Either American voters will sink into an abyss of a downward spiral, or they will climb upward. Democratic voters aren't ready to storm the barricades, but they are ready to take the stairs, at least two at a time, to meaningful social change.
Americans want normalcy. But they also want progress.

Marcia Davis is a writer in Washington and a former articles editor and writer at the Post Magazine.

The shift to the left will work - if everyone can vote

By Rebecca Solnit

I'd invert this question to say: America is far to the left of its political representation, and if we're lucky the Democrats will catch up with us. That is, the Americans who are eligible to vote believe far more sincerely in the importance of climate action, human rights and equality, social services, gun control and economic justice than the Americans who actually do vote. That's often cast as ""why didn't those young/brown/black/poor people vote"" by people uninterested in the answer. We know the answer.
Decades ago, Republicans faced a choice: They could adapt to an increasingly nonwhite America and try to win votes from people of color, or they could do their damnedest to prevent those people from voting. As we all know, they chose the second option. Former Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach's Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck program was a cynical means to remove legitimate voters from the rolls, as are some red states' new tactic of striking from the rolls anyone who didn't vote in a recent election. Voter identification laws disproportionately affected poor, nonwhite people. In many places, polls were closed, forcing voters to travel great distances; poorer places often had shoddy equipment; college students and people in poor precincts sometimes had to wait in line for hours - if they could afford to miss class or work or have someone watch the kids while they did so. As of 2016, 6 million citizens with felony convictions had their right to vote taken away - in Florida that meant 1 in 5 black voters before the laws were changed in 2018.
The country we live in has been shaped by the choices made by a disproportionately older, whiter, wealthier electorate - which is to say, more conservative. If this were a country where registering to vote and voting were protected as they should be, the voice of the voters would be heard. And that voice, or rather those voices, would choose to respond meaningfully to climate change, protect the most vulnerable and defend human rights. So the first job of a progressive agenda for 2020 is to protect the right to vote.

San Francisco writer, historian and activist Rebecca Solnit is the author of more than 20 books about geography, community, art, politics, hope and feminism. Her recent works include ""Whose Story Is This? Old Conflicts, New Chapters"" and a forthcoming memoir, ""Recollections of My Nonexistence.""

The case for cultural moderation

By Jonathan Rauch

I'll take the liberty of rephrasing the question two ways. First: ""Democratic primary voters are moving left. Will the general electorate follow?"" In 2020, the answer is: very possibly, even probably. But not because the general electorate is on board with the Sanders-Warren-AOC worldview; rather, it's because the voters get only two choices, and the alternative is Donald Trump. His ""Make America Great Again"" base, though intense, is too small to carry him to a second term. He needs a contingent of pragmatic-minded voters, and he may be alienating them to the point where they will take a chance on a normally-too-far-left Democrat.
Which begs a second version of the question: ""Democrats are moving left on economic and cultural issues. Will the country follow?"" There, the likeliest answers are: definitely yes and probably no. In 2020, no one with a shot at winning (sorry, Bill Weld) is campaigning on a free-market, small-government agenda, because there's no demand for one. Trump's own economic agenda - big spending, big deficits, trade protectionism, interventionist subsidies - confirms the bipartisan collapse of Reagan-Thatcherism (except on tax cuts). On cultural issues, however, the country is not swinging left but bifurcating. Big coastal cities and college-educated voters are going one way; rural and heartland places and working-class voters are going the other. Younger voters are more culturally left-leaning, but a lot of minority voters are culturally conservative, so demographic change won't settle this argument anytime soon. And in the short run, Democrats need some of those rural and heartland working-class votes.
The takeaway from both answers? A smart formula for Democrats would be to lean left on economics but toward the center on culture. A good place to start might be by pushing back against politically correct thought-policing online and on campus. For, say, Joe Biden or Pete Buttigieg, a ""Sister Souljah"" moment or two could go a long way.

On foreign policy, left and right are scrambled

By Anne-Marie Slaughter

Democrats are actually moving both left and right on foreign policy. Democratic presidential candidates largely tilt left on both climate change and pulling back from foreign wars and global leadership (with the exception of Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg). On the other hand, they are almost all China hawks and mostly protectionist, at least relative to both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. That is ground that President Trump has staked out and held, so it's hard to describe it purely as ""left.""
The country is likely to follow. The majority of Americans agree that climate change is increasingly an existential threat, one that we are experiencing already. Fighting climate change is a domestic as well as global subject, but measures like a carbon tax with dividends returned to the public, which is attracting support on the right and the left, would require global agreement to avoid countries profiting from tax differentials.
The question of America's role in the world is framed as ""should America be the global policeman"" by people who would say no and as ""should America continue to aspire to global leadership"" by people who would say yes. Democrats have been questioning the value of leading through use of force and the deployment of troops since 2008, when the fault line of support for or opposition to the Iraq War helped Obama become the nominee over Hillary Clinton. Even more important, the post-World War II vision of activist American leadership designed to rally our allies to help cool down hot spots and fight tyrants around the world is fading with the baby boomers who embraced it - on the right and the left.
Americans who think that our troops are overdeployed and our dollars are underappreciated abroad will be content with a foreign policy that seeks to lead more by the ""power of our example"" than the ""example of our power,"" to borrow a line used by Democrats over the years. The majority will want to shore up our alliances and strengthen our diplomatic clout, but when it becomes apparent just how much that clout depends on the credible use of force, they are likely to balk. And for this Democrat, at least, some of the money we spend on making that threat credible is better spent on education, equity and energy - of the renewable kind.

Yes to moving left. No to ideological bubbles.

By Joshua DuBois

Democrats are right to find the injustices that remain in our country and work to root them out. If that focus is described as a ""move to the left,"" then that move is a good and moral thing. More than 100 Americans die every day because of gun violence. Our climate is changing, and marginalized communities are threatened most by that change. Families are working well over 40 hours per week and still struggling to make ends meet. Individuals still face discrimination because of the color of their skin, whom they love or simply who they are. A country where we face fewer of these problems with each passing day is a country where I want to live.
However, we have to be careful to pipeline those priorities from people in communities themselves. This does not mean that we should slow the march toward progress. I believe strongly in what the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said in his ""Letter From a Birmingham Jail"": ""Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have never yet engaged in a direct action movement that was 'well timed.' "" But leaders in our party, and influential voices in the broader progressive movement, must constantly assess not just the demands we are making but the source material for those demands. Are we rooting our causes in communities, or amplifying an existing echo chamber? Are we camouflaging self- or organizational interest as community interest?
The only way to check those motivations is to spend disproportionate time listening and learning stories from communities affected the most. Those stories - and the solutions that arise from them - are often more nuanced, careful, hopeful and ultimately righteous than the simple, uncompromising messages we tend to share in our own circles, online and offline.

General-election voters will not be pleased

By Lanhee J. Chen

Americans won't follow the Democrats to the left because the policy solutions that come with that move are ultimately unappealing. While the proposals being touted by leading progressive Democrats may sound good at first, further analysis almost always exposes their flaws.
A prime example of this is the way in which Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have been widely criticized - by Democrats and Republicans alike - for the Medicare-for-all plans that they support. The plans will displace current private insurance arrangements for hundreds of millions of Americans and are so expensive that neither Sanders nor Warren can honestly explain how they'll be paid for. Quite simply, Americans aren't ready to follow Democrats to the left if it means wrecking the health-care system we have now.
And there are other policy examples, too. Take Democrats' movement toward decriminalizing border crossings and their criticism of physical barriers at America's southern border. Or their support of wealth taxes that have rarely worked in any other country where they've been tried and often lead not to more tax revenue but more tax evasion. Or progressives' advocacy for policies to fight climate change that could raise the price of energy for many households, cost up to tens of trillions of dollars, and result in dramatic changes to the ways we live and work.
While these policies are appealing to the progressive Democrats who will largely populate the primaries and caucuses, they will be a challenge for Democrats once a broader electorate examines them more closely. It's hard to imagine that Americans will follow Democrats to the left if it means supporting the far-left ideas we've heard espoused by many presidential candidates this year. That's why we can expect the Democratic nominee for president - whoever she or he is - to pivot to a more palatable middle ground once the general-election campaign begins in earnest.

Latinx voters are leading the shift to the left

By Natalia Salgado

For black and brown communities across our country, the question of whether America will follow the leftward surge is a question of life or death. Donald Trump is denying immigrants, specifically Latinx immigrants, a life in this country, or a life at all. The shootings in Ohio and El Paso are proof that the Trump presidency has put Latinx lives at risk by emboldening those who think that this country should work just for white people.
We - as Latinx voters and, more broadly, voters of color - are leading the move to the left. We are demanding that the Democratic Party follow. This is a huge shift for a party that has historically ignored us except for last-ditch efforts leading up to an election. Through grass-roots organizations and networks like the Center for Popular Democracy Action, Mijente, Texas Organizing Project, CASA, Make the Road and others, we are pushing the Democratic Party to take our votes seriously and propose policies that create a future for all of us in this country. The movement of the Democratic Party to the left is a necessary step, but a reactive one.
Voters of color, including Latinx voters, are an increasing percentage of the American electorate - and our share will only grow bigger. There are 32 million Latinx voters who will be eligible to vote in the 2020 election. For us to turn out, we need a candidate who will commit to undoing the damage that Trump has caused us and to proactively promoting a vision for this country that includes us and allows us to thrive.
If a leftward move of the Democratic Party means a move to represent our voices, our perspectives and our interests, then that is the direction we should be headed.

The left-right spectrum has lost all meaning

By Katherine Mangu-Ward

The left-right spectrum is worse than useless for understanding the American ideological landscape. We live in a world where Fox News pundit and unofficial presidential adviser Tucker Carlson has kind words to say about Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren's extremely progressive economic policy proposals, but only because he thinks they will help restore traditional family structure and bring back blue-collar manufacturing jobs.
The snake isn't just eating its own tail, it appears to be vomiting it back up as well.
Since Donald Trump became president and embarked on his convoluted trade war, Democrats have a newfound skepticism about tariffs. Republicans, meanwhile, are no longer troubled by deficit spending and even seem keen on some new entitlements, such as mandatory paid parental leave. Every major-party 2020 hopeful is campaigning on regulation of free speech online; Democrats want to bar hate speech on social media while Republicans are mad at massive corporations (!) for what they perceive as ""censorship"" of conservative opinions. Things are even more topsy-turvy in foreign policy, where a sitting Republican champions antiwar views (while oscillating wildly on implementation) and powerful Democrats take to the nation's op-ed pages to urge him to listen to the wise generals who favor the interventionist status quo.
All of which is to say: I'm not at all sure what it means to say the Democrats (or Americans) are moving left. But Americans seem increasingly comfortable with reactionary authoritarianism in its various guises. Both socialism and nationalism are experiencing resurgences in popularity after having spent decades in the doghouse for very good reasons. There is a bipartisan consensus emerging in favor of a larger, stronger and more-intrusive government. And that's a more telling - and worrying - trend than whatever the polls say about left or right.

You can't defeat Trumpism without a broad coalition

By Neera Tanden

Under Trump's presidency, most Democrats - and much of the country - feel that America faces an existential threat to progressive values and to our democracy as a whole. That is why electability has become such a central issue in the Democratic primaries. But this debate is not just about the best candidate to beat Trump. It is also about the best kind of campaign and agenda to defeat him.
Part of the debate concerns ideology: whether the best strategy for winning is a left agenda that could energize the base, or a broader and more practical agenda that could attract swing voters. However, this is a false choice.
Only mobilizing the Democratic base may not be enough in 2020, since we know Trump will likely motivate his own core supporters. In fact, Trump's recent campaigning in the Louisiana governor's race turned out an additional 200,000 voters compared with the last election in 2015 - many of them white and rural - helping to force a runoff for the Democratic incumbent.
In 2020, Democrats can - and should - turn out their base, while simultaneously making their case to swing voters. That's precisely what happened in 2018. Participation rates among millennials and people of color soared, with the number of Latino voters nearly doubling from the previous midterm elections in 2014. But persuadable Trump voters played the more important role: According to Catalist, a progressive firm that tracks voter data, ""Democratic gains were … largely driven by voters who voted for Trump in 2016 and voted Democratic in 2018.""
We can have a bold agenda that also appeals to a wide spectrum of voters. For example, the Center for American Progress has released a proposal that would achieve universal health care by creating a national health plan similar to Medicare that's open to everyone, while allowing those who receive private insurance through their employers to keep their current plans. This approach receives broad support across the political landscape, including from a majority of Democrats in Iowa. What's more, it would not raise taxes on the middle class - making it less vulnerable to attacks from Trump while still providing coverage for all.
To end Trumpism, not just beat Trump, will take a major electoral defeat. That is possible, but it means building a broad coalition with a broad agenda.

A centrist's case for a leftward tilt

By Elaine C. Kamarck

America is already there. Which is why, as an avowed centrist, I have no problem with my party's leftward tilt, especially on economic issues.
In recent decades the country has undergone what is often called the ""financialization"" of the economy: People who make money playing with money have become richer and more important than people who make things that we like and use such as iPhones and washing machines. Think of it as Wall Street takes out Main Street. This doctrine encompassed a set of behaviors that emphasized short-term returns to investors over long-term growth. The economist William Lazonick of the University of Massachusetts at Lowell has summed up these changes as a shift from ""retain-and-reinvest to downsize-and-distribute."" The results have cost Americans good jobs and hollowed out the middle class while increasing returns to an obscenely rich 1 percent.
This ""vulture capitalism"" plays out in several ways. One is through the work of so-called activist investors. Indeed, an activist-investor drama is taking place as I write. Elliott Management Corp., a large hedge fund, has been buying stock in AT&T. Elliott has recently put AT&T on notice that it could be more profitable (i.e., have a higher short-term stock price) if it divested landline businesses and closed retail stores. The Communications Workers of America, a labor union, estimates that these suggestions could negatively affect 30,000 workers.
Average Americans have seen this happen hundreds of times in their own towns. It was one of the biggest reasons that, in 2012, Mitt Romney lost the presidential election. I am neutral in the Democratic presidential race, but it is clear that anger at a capitalism that guts corporations and kills jobs to enrich the 1 percent is fueling the campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of the first people to blow the whistle on it. When it comes to correcting the abuses of vulture capitalism, the Democratic Party's leftward tilt is a very real response to what has happened to Americans and their jobs.

Fealty to intersectional politics spells doom

By Wesley Yang

At the recent LGBTQ candidates forum, Elizabeth Warren promised a 9-year-old transgender boy input into whom she would name to run the Department of Education.
Trans people make up a minuscule percentage of the electorate. And yet, this gesture - like other similar ones by her campaign - was a necessary symbolic act of fealty to a specific mode of politics. Warren was deferring to the activist cadres that run and staff the organs of the institutional left. This faction is situated at critical choke points of the nonprofit and governmental civil rights apparatus, which derives its power and authority from the manufacture of new protected classes on whose behalf the latest moral crusade requiring federal intervention can be launched. These factions in turn are axially allied with a novelty-seeking media that has a role in reporting what happened, but an even larger role, as the writer Ben Sixsmith has put it, in ""memeing trends into existence.""
The California state legislature recently tabled a model ethnic studies curriculum for public high school students, which the same body has repeatedly tried to make a graduation requirement. The curriculum calls on students to ""critique empire and its relationship to white supremacy, racism, patriarchy, cisheteropatriarchy, capitalism, ableism, anthropocentrism and other forms of power and oppression,"" in order to ""connect ourselves to past and contemporary resistance movements that struggle for social justice."" This is the language around which this new administrative class has coalesced.
When the Working Families Party made the surprising choice to endorse Warren over Bernie Sanders, it was likely motivated by the concerns and interests of these cadres, who are pursuing the ""intersectional"" practice of stitching together a tapestry of identity groups in shared pursuit of the power vested in the federal government to regulate. Sanders is an old white man fixed in a mid-20th-century class politics that this coalition regards as essentially anachronistic, not just because of who he is but because, as an outsider to the institutional Democratic Party, he is a stranger to the administrative classes for whom the language of ""ableism"" and ""cisheteropatriarchy"" is the coin of the realm.
This intersectional approach is excellent at acquiring power through intramural struggle within institutions. It has been less successful in winning national elections. Whether the country follows the Democratic Party on its left turn largely depends on whether Warren or whoever the party picks as its standard-bearer can preserve some room to maneuver apart from the implacable demands of this faction. At the moment, I'm not optimistic.

Democrats are finally catching up on racial justice

By Peniel Joseph

Since at least Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, the Democratic Party, to both the benefit and the ill of its electoral prospects, has been identified as the party of social justice and racial equality. Losing five of six presidential contests between 1968 and 1988 prompted a rightward shift exemplified by Bill Clinton's politically deft yet morally reprehensible triangulation on the question of black America. Easily the most striking aspect of today's Democratic primary race has been the distance traveled, especially by some contenders, from the days when Clinton triumphantly passed criminal justice and welfare reform that penalized the black poor. The candid discussion of reparations for descendants of enslaved African Americans shows how far we've come since Democrats believed that racial scapegoating was necessary for electoral success.
The Obama coalition built its political strength on demographic transformations combined with the implicit belief that the election of a black president could both represent racial progress and contribute to the eradication of institutional racism. Donald Trump's electoral coalition, based on explicit and ugly appeals to white nationalism, upended the racial optimism of 2008-2009 and liberated Democrats from speaking politely about racial equality while largely ignoring the promotion of racial justice as a policy agenda. The rise of Kamala Harris, Ayanna Pressley and Stacey Abrams has highlighted the fact that black women represent the party's ""stickiest"" voter, a loyal constituency that Democrats now need more than ever to reclaim the White House. On race matters, Democratic support of reparations, ending mass incarceration, universal health care and a living wage for all Americans recognizes right as well as reality.
Ultimately, for Democrats to regain the White House they must offer a political vision that recognizes the centrality of race to our national politics, but in a manner that pushes us closer to, rather than farther from, the ""beloved community"" that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. often evoked. For King that community required elected officials and ordinary citizens to wrestle with the legacy of slavery, the impact of Jim Crow and the prevalence of inequality throughout society. Contemporary Democrats bold enough to discuss the structural nature of racial inequality and the way race continues to shape positive and negative social, economic and political outcomes recognize that to achieve our country's highest aspirations requires plumbing the depths of its lowest historical moments. That means that Democrats are on the right path to not only electoral success but also a long overdue reckoning about the relationship between race and democracy. Will America follow? If Americans of all races and backgrounds who proudly joined the Obama coalition are given free and unfettered access to the polls next year, the answer promises to be a resounding yes.

Actually, Democrats are moving to the center

By Howard Dean

Much has been made of the supposed movement of the Democratic Party to the left. But the evidence suggests that the Democratic Party as a whole is more centrist than it was four years ago, while the electorate is moving from center-right to center-left.
First, while the four dynamic and outspoken women who make up ""The Squad"" were winning seats in Congress in 2018, Americans were also electing more than 30 other new representatives from Orange County, Calif., as well as Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma and Virginia, replacing very conservative members like Dave Brat, Dana Rohrabacher and Pete Sessions. These members, like Conor Lamb, who won two congressional elections in rural Pennsylvania last year, are centrist Democrats. Many of them are veterans.
Second, it is fair to say that the debate among presidential contenders skews left given the strong showings by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. But Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg have staked out more-moderate positions, and the latter two are climbing. Kamala Harris also appears to be portraying herself as a practical progressive.
Finally, the Democrats' rise is entirely because our party base is increasingly young, female and of color. But the younger generation, which elected Barack Obama, is in many ways more moderate than mine. Gay rights, diversity, climate change and women's reproductive freedom are critical issues for them, but they also don't trust big institutions - including political parties, government, religious authoritarians, big corporations and labor unions.
The most interesting phenomenon to me, however, is that roughly 70 percent of under-35s, independent of ethnicity and gender, vote for Democrats, not because they love the party but because our values and their values are mostly a good fit. Republican values are too authoritarian, too spendthrift and too oriented toward corporate donors to appeal to this generation anytime soon. This new generation is fiscally moderate and socially very progressive with a streak of libertarianism, and they are now the largest voting bloc in the electorate. Even as they are dragging the Democrats toward the center, they are also dragging the politics of the country as a whole leftward because they are so overwhelmingly socially conscious compared with the more authoritarian and much older generation of Republican voters.

A plea for national unity, not socialism

By Rep. Will Hurd

Our nation faces generation-defining challenges as we enter an age when American military and economic dominance is no longer guaranteed. My experiences as a former undercover CIA officer and member of Congress have convinced me that to solve these challenges we must understand that way more unites us than divides us as a country. The most successful politicians of the future will have to defy the political truism that, as summarized by author Tim Alberta, ""elections in modern America are won principally by mobilizing the base, not persuading the middle.""
As you are reading this, China is working to replace the United States as the most important economy in the world, and our adversaries are challenging us around the globe. If they are successful, the quality of life of every American will decline. To meet this challenge, we should strengthen alliances, not weaken them, and be prepared to fight the wars of the future, not the wars of the past. America is successful only when our enemies fear us and our friends trust us.
According to a Federal Reserve survey, 39 percent of Americans would struggle to cover an unexpected $400 expense. To ease these burdens we should empower people, not the government; however, many Democrats have proposed policies like taking away private health insurance from millions of people or ending the energy revolution we are currently benefiting from. These policies will negatively affect all Americans by weakening our economy and national security. For every family to have a chance at the American Dream, we must promote prosperity through free markets, not socialism.
Representing one of the most swing districts in the country, I know that reasonable Democrats and independents share these concerns and agree on the solutions. That's how I've defied the odds and continued to win.

How left-wing foreign policy converged with Trumpism

By Aaron L. Friedberg

Democrats may be running hard to the left on domestic policy, but on foreign policy at least the more ""progressive"" among them appear to be headed in the same direction as President Trump: toward a greatly diminished U.S. world role.
Like their arch-nemesis, progressive Democrats want to end the nation's ""endless"" wars and to avoid future military interventions, especially in the Middle East. Like Trump, they are skeptical of the benefits of free trade and believe that the international economic system has been ""rigged"" to benefit ""globalist"" elites. And, like Trump, they want to focus on ""making America great again"" or, as they might prefer, on ""nation-building at home.""
There are differences, of course. Trump is scornful of international institutions, denigrates America's traditional allies and defines the nation's interests in narrowly material terms. Progressives, by contrast, speak the lofty language of human rights and universal values, and hope to find cooperative, multilateral solutions to every global problem. Trump's desire to put ""America first"" risks leaving it isolated. The progressives' inclination to turn inward, cut defense spending and unfurl massive social welfare programs risks allowing external challenges to grow unchecked.
There are less-extreme voices to be heard on both sides of the political aisle, including from a few of the Democratic candidates and some congressional Republicans, as well as many former Democratic officials and their currently exiled ""Never Trump"" Republican counterparts. Dismissed by their parties' populists as out-of-touch and irrelevant, the views of these centrists may actually be closer to those of most Americans. A recent report by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs shows that significant majorities - despite favoring a measure of restraint - still express support for preserving military superiority, maintaining alliances, pursuing trade and promoting democracy. In other words, although the necessary leadership may be lacking at the moment among both Republicans and Democrats, public support for an active, engaged U.S. foreign policy remains strong.

One of the two Americas is shifting left

By Tanzina Vega

It depends on which America you're talking about. Despite the Mueller report, the impeachment inquiry, multiple allegations of sexual misconduct and abuse, racial animus toward immigrants and asylum seekers, and deeply unpopular foreign policy initiatives, support for President Trump has remained around 40 percent. Expecting his base to shift is useless.
As a nation, however, we're becoming more racially diverse and less religious. We are also less able to get and sustain wealth. The yawning inequality gap in the United States has many Americans, young and old, disillusioned about the so-called American Dream. From digital media companies in cities like New York to factory floors in the Midwest, workers across the country are demanding better pay and protections from an increasingly automated economy. Americans are also scarred from the exorbitant costs of health care and prescription drugs, and from an opioid crisis that has devastated families and communities. All of these things have pushed younger Democrats further from the political center than their parents, and have invigorated marginalized groups to become more vocal in the fight for civil rights and economic justice.
The majority of Americans disapprove of the job this president is doing, and they want to see change. We already hear Democratic presidential candidates talking about concepts like the racial wealth gap, growing income inequality, criminal justice reform and LGBTQ rights in far more progressive terms than would have been thinkable during the last election cycle.
There is a fierce debate happening among Democratic voters about which candidate they'd prefer to have as a nominee. Younger voters of color seem captivated by Julián Castro's progressive stances on many of these issues as opposed to Joe Biden's centrist and at times rambling approach to maintaining the status quo. Kamala Harris, a woman of color, has taken her share of criticism for her prosecutorial past, while Bernie Sanders, a white man in his 70s, nabbed an endorsement from progressive millennial icon Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But in the end, I suspect Democrats will have no choice but to vote for whoever runs against Trump, regardless of how progressive (or not) they happen to be.

Voters want an end to our rigged economic system

By Sheila Bair

The tango requires close synchronization between two partners. For decades, the government and moneyed interests have been performing a political version of it, gliding across a ballroom strewn with special breaks, boondoggles and bailouts. The failure of the Democratic ticket to acknowledge this unseemly pas de deux led to its defeat in 2016. This time around, most of the Democratic presidential candidates have felt the public's not-so-gentle tap on their shoulders and have vowed that their administration will partner with the public electorate who brought them to the ball. Yet, to do so, they promise a bigger and more powerful government - the same government that has been so willing to let profiteers fill its dance card in the past.
Democrats have been as willing as Republicans to tango with the rent-reaping lounge lizards. Time and again, well-intended government programs aimed at expanded public access to health care, education or homeownership are co-opted by profit-seeking concerns. Tax breaks meant to spur economic growth instead exacerbate yawning economic inequality while inflating bubbles, as tax-advantaged dollars chase too few opportunities for real economic growth. Government regulators become captive of the regulated. Whether it's plane crashes or financial crashes, the public is put at risk.
The general electorate wants to break up the dance party. This includes many business leaders who are also fed up with government waste and favoritism. But they will be skeptical of more government as the solution. Andrew Yang's idea for giving financial support directly to families - cutting out the government and industry middlemen - may have particular appeal. Ultimately, the person will be more important than the policy, giving the edge to a candidate such as Elizabeth Warren, who has made restoring independence, integrity and trust in government a centerpiece of her campaign. That is the kind of leadership Americans need to bounce the cronies off the dance floor.

Borders with justice are in sync with America

By Hiroshi Motomura

Republicans try hard to cast Democratic presidential candidates as ""open borders"" advocates, feeding the narrative that Democrats are ""moving left."" But nothing suggests that the Democratic candidates are especially ""left"" on immigration. In fact, they are very mainstream. Rather than wondering if America will follow, it's more accurate to say that the Democrats are following America.
What do Democratic candidates and many Americans find deeply troubling? Not just separating children from parents, but sidestepping the rules in U.S. immigration law requiring full asylum hearings before immigration judges. Not just keeping spouses from living together in the United States, but doing so with a ""travel ban"" targeting six Muslim countries. Not just ending the humane treatment of young undocumented immigrants under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, but ignoring Congress's requirements that any administration articulate rational reasons for policy changes. Broad public revulsion with the administration's immigration policies has nothing to do with open borders. The Democrats are actually defending borders and U.S. sovereignty - by insisting on borders with justice.
Borders allow us to promote equality and dignity on the inside, as a way to build a stronger America. But if borders are to help create a just society, they must be ethical borders. This means that presidents must not weaponize immigration to stoke racial and religious prejudice or to divide Americans. Presidents must not use race, ethnicity or religion to treat some Americans better than others. It cannot matter if you are from Nigeria or Norway, Syria or Slovenia. Enforcement cannot be especially harsh against migrants from Latin America. Presidents must not ride roughshod over the immigration framework that Congress has enacted into statutes. Presidents must not ignore the basic principles of fairness that make sure enforcement is consistent with the rule of law.
But this administration is guilty of all these fundamental violations, undermining why we have borders in the first place. When Democratic candidates object, they aren't supporting open borders. If Democrats make it clearer that they want borders with justice, they will be on the same page as the vast majority of Americans.

Democrats must refuse to be (falsely) called radicals

By Moisés Naím

Americans will not follow politicians who fit the caricature that Donald Trump and Fox News use to depict opponents of the incumbent president.
America-hating, illegal-immigrant-loving, soft-on-crime radical socialists will not do well with voters. Fortunately, these radical socialists are scarce and not very influential. Unfortunately, they are omnipresent in Trump's speeches and tweets.
Politicians with credible proposals to solve the concrete problems that besiege Americans will do well with voters who are unwilling to take the president's claims at face value. That is why persuading voters to double-check the president's accusations and denounce his exaggerations and falsehoods will be important goals of his adversaries. But that will not be enough. The attacks of the president and his supporters need to be answered with a pragmatic stance and concrete solutions. For example, Democrats should keep reminding voters that a more affordable health care that is available to more Americans is not a left- or right-wing issue. It is what any citizen of one of the richest countries in the world has the right to expect.
Contrary to the National Rifle Association's rhetoric, banning assault rifles designed to massacre a large number of people in a short period of time or requiring background checks for gun buyers are not measures promoted by the left to undermine America. These are treated as common-sense ideas anywhere else in the world - and, increasingly, by American voters as well. 
Suspending U.S. foreign aid to the Central American countries where hellish living conditions prompt hundreds of thousands of people to seek refuge in the United States is not a smart, hawkish right-wing, anti-illegal-immigrant policy. It is, instead, a self-inflicted wound that weakens America because it boosts the pressures Central Americans have to leave their homes and flee north.
Defending the human rights of oppressed people everywhere is not a right or left issue either. It is one of the goals that the foreign policy of the world's most powerful democracy should never abandon even if, at times, it may conflict with other national interests.
Americans are pragmatists, not ideologues. Voters will follow candidates who speak to their concrete needs and aspirations. The challenge for Democrats is to show that Trump's policies, while at times seductive, are in fact poisonous and often hurt the great majority of Americans. And to show that the policies he routinely denounces as radical are no such thing.

LGBT equality isn't a left-right issue anymore

By Sharon McGowan

As significant as our legal victories have been since the Stonewall riots 50 years ago, perhaps more important has been the increase in social acceptance for LGBT people and our families. While there are certainly far too many places where anti-LGBT discrimination is rampant, it is no longer possible to describe support for LGBT civil rights as some kind of radical ""lefty"" position. We know this because a majority of people support marriage equality in 44 of the 50 states; 71 percent support transgender people serving in the military; over two-thirds support laws that ""would protect gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people against discrimination in jobs, public accommodations, and housing""; and six in 10 Americans are also opposed to businesses refusing to provide products and services to gay and lesbian people for religious reasons. In other words, far from causing ""social upheaval,"" the vindication of LGBT civil rights sits comfortably within the political mainstream.
Unfortunately, however, we continue to see anti-LGBT forces fighting this wave of public acceptance with every tool in their arsenal. For example, as cities in red states across the country increasingly try to expand protections against discrimination, deeply conservative - and often highly gerrymandered - state legislatures shut down these efforts by claiming that such local ordinances are preempted by state law.
Perhaps the most troubling trend is the packing of our federal judiciary with anti-LGBT ideologues. Notwithstanding far-reaching acceptance for our civil rights, this administration has succeeded in confirming judges at a record pace. Because these are lifetime appointments, we are now facing a generation or more of a federal judiciary that will be taking aim at our civil rights, and not surprisingly, our opponents are more emboldened than ever. Therefore, we cannot become complacent, and must recommit ourselves to the fight for full equality.
But make no mistake about it: This is no longer an issue of left vs. right. We know it, and the rest of the country does, too.

Voters are ready for bold action

By Richard Cordray

The American people are demanding progress toward real answers for the major problems we face. They want bold action. Most of us want a lasting solution to the constant threat that health-care costs pose to our families. The Trump administration utterly failed to ""repeal and replace"" Obamacare yet is still trying to dismantle the gains made to broaden coverage, control costs and protect those with preexisting conditions. On climate change, most people accept the overwhelming evidence and recognize the growing frequency of extreme weather events. They want meaningful action on renewable energy and new leadership to rebuild our global alliances to address this existential threat to our planet. Families want their children to be able to get the education and training they need to compete in our fast-moving economy without drowning in debt. And people are chafing at the dramatic and increasing income inequality that is driving down prospects for the middle class.
Despite inheriting a strong economy, the Trump administration has pushed the deficit to nearly a trillion dollars this year, with little to show for it except irresponsible tax cuts that benefit those who are already wealthy. On the major issues - health care, climate change, access to higher education and job training, income inequality and so much more - most Americans believe that we need to deliver big structural changes to move our country forward. They want practical reforms, but they will not be content with small half-measures. This same feeling gripped the country with the progressive movement, the New Deal and the Reagan Revolution. Americans seek real leadership on these issues, and the Democrats must offer a persuasive vision with the courage and determination to make it happen.

'Not Donald Trump' isn't enough

By Prachi Gupta

In the wake of Trump's election, establishment Democrats struggled to find a more compelling vision than just ""We are not Donald Trump."" In July 2017, former congressman Joe Crowley told the Associated Press that the party's message was still ""being worked on."" Almost a year later Crowley, the fourth most powerful Democrat in the House, was ousted by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old democratic socialist. After her primary victory, Ocasio-Cortez told MSNBC: ""We have to stick to the message: What are we proposing to the American people? Not, 'What are we fighting against?' "" Within a year, the once-fringe ideas she championed - like the Green New Deal - have forced Democratic presidential candidates to move left.
Of course, many party leaders still are not on board with this shift, and recent polls indicate that almost half of Americans find the party too radical. Yet if Democratic leaders run back to the center, as they have in the past, they will risk repeating the mistakes of Hillary Clinton and handing another victory to Trump. Rather than chase the elusive swing Republican voter, Democratic leadership should lean harder into a movement that is so clearly animating its base.
Republicans have normalized right-wing extremism, both in rhetoric and policy. If America is to follow Democrats to the left (or even back to the center), Democrats must unify behind a strong, bold vision; they must reframe public debates around abortion, democratic socialism, immigration and climate change; and they must find a way to translate their values into terms that resonate with working-class people, people of color and young people - even in deeply red pockets. Gen Z is the most ethnically and racially diverse generation in U.S. history. To lead them, Democrats need to offer a brighter future, rather than simply trying to avoid the past.

On the economy, Americans are already there

By Heidi Shierholz

The answer to ""The Democrats are moving left. Will America follow?"" is no, because America is already there. Poll after poll shows that the large majority of progressive policies are already deeply popular.
Take the minimum wage. Pollsters have always found broad support for minimum-wage increases. Polls conducted earlier this year show a majority of Americans support increasing the minimum wage to $15, which is where the vast majority of Democratic presidential candidates stand on the issue.
What about unions? Many Democratic candidates have very progressive labor platforms - which is exactly what workers want, since although less than 12 percent of workers are in a union, the share jumps to over 50 percent if you include nonunion workers who report they want to be in a union.
Polling shows that most Republicans and Democrats support maintaining or increasing spending on Social Security, and that most Americans support higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations, paid family and medical leave, and on and on. In proposing these things, the Democrats are simply catching up to what America wants.
This doesn't mean the work of progressive leaders is completely done. For example, while a large majority of Americans say they support Medicare ""for all who want it,"" support drops to less than 50 percent when respondents are asked whether they support Medicare-for-all that eliminates private insurance. In other words, on some things, more work will be needed to pull people along, and Democrats need a plan to convince the skeptical. But these are the exceptions, not the rule. On most progressive policies, Democrats' move to the left has simply moved them closer to where America was all along.

Florida shows the potential of progressivism

By Andrea Mercado

Democrats moving left with bold policy proposals on education, climate, housing and health care are finally listening to America's families and our real needs. With rampant racism and historic inequality, this is a time for strong leadership.
The last few election cycles in Florida prove we can energize a broad coalition of young people, black and brown communities, women and more around dynamic leaders with transformative policies. In 2016, Democrats lost Florida after nominating a candidate who did not motivate our base. Many of our voters stayed home, while the other side used fear and division to galvanize its base. In comparison, 2018 saw the biggest upset in Florida in the past 20 years when a bold, progressive black candidate won the Democratic nomination for governor, even after being heavily outspent by a large number of well-known middle-of-the-road candidates. Floridians heard Andrew Gillum and saw themselves represented in his story, his values and his vision for a state where we all belong. While he narrowly lost the governor's mansion by less than half a percentage point, he garnered more votes than any Democratic contender in the past 20 years. He engaged and inspired young voters and voters of color, who don't vote at the same rates as their white counterparts.
In Florida, we are coming together to build a new majority of voters that is demanding real leadership, not politicians who don't come from our communities and are too afraid to talk about what is really affecting our lives. Will Democrats follow?

Andrea Mercado is executive director of the New Florida Majority.

Democrats are in danger of going too far

By Ruy Teixeira

Is the country moving to the left? Absolutely. Are the Democrats moving to the left? Absolutely. Could the Democrats move too far to the left? Absolutely.
Consider the evidence. According to political scientist James Stimson's public policy mood index - which measures sentiment across a wide range of policies - Americans' support for government action is now at its highest level since the 1960s. Thus the idea that the country is moving to the left is not wishful thinking on the part of liberal pundits and politicians.
Meanwhile, it can scarcely be disputed that the Democrats are moving to the left. Simply look at the range of measures under discussion in the primary debates. Even the leading ""moderate"" candidate, Joe Biden, is pushing policies substantially to the left of what Hillary Clinton ran on in 2016, including a public health insurance plan open to all Americans.
But it also cannot be disputed that Democrats could run too far to the left for even a country that is moving leftward. Take some of the policies that have been under discussion in the Democratic debates and pushed by Democratic activists:

1. Reparations for the descendants of slaves. This is massively unpopular. It would be more consistent with a country moving leftward to advocate needed social programs that happen to disproportionately benefit black Americans because of their income, education or location.

2. Decriminalizing the border or abolishing ICE. Neither of these measures is remotely consistent with the views of the public. It would make more sense for Democrats to advocate for reforming the enforcement agency plus a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants plus a humane immigration policy that still includes border security.

3. Medicare-for-all that eliminates private insurance. The polling could not be clearer: What the public really wants is Medicare-for-anyone or Medicare-for-all-who-want-it. This is embodied in the DeLauro-Schakowsky Medicare for America bill, as well as in the positions of some of the more moderate Democratic candidates.

4. A Green New Deal that commits to 100 percent renewable energy within 10 years. The public is not on board with anything quite so ambitious, but there is significant support for a Green New Deal that would focus on jobs, infrastructure and research.
In my view, these are the ""four don'ts"" of the 2020 campaign. Avoiding these are the key to Democrats moving smoothly to the left along with the country as a whole.

SEATTLE - An effort believed to be tied to the Iranian government attempted to identify, attack and breach email accounts belonging to a U.S. presidential campaign, government officials and journalists, according to new data unveiled by Microsoft, highlighting the continued global security threats that loom over the fast-approaching 2020 election.
The intrusion observed by Microsoft, spearheaded by an outfit it calls Phosphorus, made more than 2,700 attempts to identify personal email addresses that belonged to the company's customers over a 30-day period between August and September, 241 of which were then attacked. Four were compromised, but they do not belong to the presidential campaign or government officials, according to the tech giant.
Reuters and other news media outlets reported Friday that the hackers had targeted President Trump's campaign.
Microsoft said it notified the customers attacked and has worked with those whose accounts were compromised to secure them. It declined to disclose the names of the account holders, including the presidential campaign that had been targeted. Microsoft declined to comment beyond a blog post disclosing the news on Friday.
Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for President Trump's 2020 campaign, said he has ""no indication that any of our campaign infrastructure was targeted."" Asked to clarify whether Microsoft had contacted the campaign about Iranian targeting of either the campaign or campaign personnel's personal email accounts, Murtaugh said: ""We have no further comment.""
The news Friday is the latest reminder that the United States is probably still vulnerable to security threats when it comes to the 2020 presidential election - and not just from Russia. Analysts have seen an increase in cyberactivity by Iran and its proxies in recent months targeting the United States and other countries, as tensions have heightened between Iran and the West.
Tech giants such as Facebook and Twitter, and politicians and security officials have all made the next presidential election a priority as they race to combat hackers - some of whom are working for foreign governments.
Still, recent technology developments, such as increasingly realistic ""deepfake"" or otherwise manipulated videos, have many cybersecurity experts concerned about how hackers might be able to influence public perception.
During the last presidential election, U.S. officials uncovered a sprawling Kremlin-backed effort on major social media sites to trigger social and political unrest. Russian hackers also targeted Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by hacking the emails of one of her top lieutenants, the contents of which were later dumped on WikiLeaks.
Since then, other countries have come to adopt more of Russia's playbook. Iran for years had targeted U.S. officials through ""large-scale intrusion attempts,"" said John Hultquist, the director of intelligence analysis at the cybersecurity firm FireEye. But it has become more aggressive recently in response to President Trump, who has imposed extensive sanctions and pulled out of an international deal over the country's nuclear program, he said. 
""The Iranians are very aggressive, and they could leverage whatever access they get for an upper hand in any kind of negotiations,"" Hultquist added. ""They could cause a lot of mayhem.""
Other tech companies also have been warning about the rising Iranian threat, largely out of concern that malicious actors originating in the country were spreading disinformation online. In May, for example, Facebook and Twitter said they had removed a sprawling Iranian-based propaganda operation, including accounts that mimicked Republican congressional candidates and appeared to try to push pro-Iranian political messages on social media. Some of those accounts similarly took aim at U.S. policymakers and journalists, researchers said at the time.
Christopher Krebs, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency under the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement that the agency is working with Microsoft.
""Microsoft's claims that a presidential campaign was targeted is yet more evidence that our adversaries are looking to undermine our democratic institutions,"" he said in the statement.

Microsoft software is present in far more computers around the world than U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies, giving the company a broader window into the threat.
The Democratic National Committee warned campaigns about the Phosphorus attacks Tuesday, noting that the hacking group has been targeting personal and professional email accounts. It recommended that members review logs for connection attempts in August and September.
""They create believable spear phishing emails and fake LinkedIn profiles as primary tactics,"" according to the email from the DNC obtained by The Washington Post. Microsoft also owns the LinkedIn professional social network.
Spokespeople for Democratic candidates, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.), did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople for former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) declined to comment. Ian Sams, a spokesman for Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), said he had ""no indication that our campaign is the one Microsoft referenced or that we have been targeted by this attack.""
To target political and government officials' emails, Phosphorus hackers tried to figure out how to reset passwords or otherwise trigger account recovery features to take over accounts, Microsoft said. In some instances, Microsoft found that the group gathered phone numbers belonging to its targets to try to authenticate password resets.
The attacks were not ""technically sophisticated,"" Microsoft's vice president of customer security and trust, Tom Burt, wrote in the blog post. But he noted that they used significant amounts of the targets' personal information, suggesting that Phosphorus was willing to invest ""significant time and resources engaging in research and other means of information gathering.""
This isn't Microsoft's first brush with Phosphorus. The company, which names hacking groups after elements on the periodic table, seized 99 websites in March that it said were used by the group to launch cyberattacks against government agencies, businesses and users in Washington. Microsoft said it has been tracking the group for six years. Other researchers have tagged the group Ajax Security Team, APT 35 and Charming Kitten.
Phosphorus used the websites Microsoft seized this spring to trick visitors into downloading malicious software that appeared authentic. But that was only one of the group's tactics. In Phosphorus's latest attempts, the group tried to trick users into giving up codes that are used for two-factor authentication.

The Democratic presidential candidates have been on the campaign trail for nearly a year. Confusion rather than clarity continues to be the story of their contest for the 2020 nomination. 
Early in the year, the party's liberal wing seemed to be ascendant, defined by the candidacies of Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and the embrace of a single-payer, Medicare-for-all health-care program. Sanders and Warren were calling for other dramatic changes to the system "" economic and political "" and their voices stood out. Some other candidates offered echoes of their ideas.
That proved to be a misleading indicator of where the Democratic electorate stood on some of the issues, particularly health care, in part because fewer moderate voices were being heard. Former vice president Joe Biden didn't join the race until April. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg wasn't being taken very seriously. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) wasn't breaking through.
The candidate debates provided the setting for the arguments to play out before a larger audience. Warren and Sanders came under attack from moderate Democrats at the first debate in June in Miami, with former Maryland congressman John Delaney the most vocal. But Warren and Sanders more than held their own. The progressive wing appeared to be on solid ground. 
Subsequent debates, however, have produced a different impression. The progressives have been much more on the defensive and the moderates more assertive. Biden tangled with Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) in the Detroit debate over the issue of health care. Harris subsequently modified her position, moving toward the center. On the issue of Medicare-for-all, the ground has shifted.
During the Atlanta debate in late November, even Sanders seemed to be tempering his overall message. Asked about comments by former president Barack Obama, who had earlier told some wealthy Democratic donors that the country wasn't looking for a revolution, Sanders replied, 'He's right. We don't have to tear down the system, but we do have to do what the American people want.'
Judged by the current polling in the four early states, the more-moderate candidates are prospering. To the surprise of many, Buttigieg is at the top of the field in Iowa and New Hampshire, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls. No one would have predicted that last spring.
Biden trails Buttigieg, Sanders and Warren in those two states, which is hardly a comfortable place to be for someone who was the acknowledged leader in the race when he announced his candidacy and who continues to lead in national polling. But he is ahead in Nevada and he has a big lead in South Carolina, where strong support from African American voters gives him what he hopes will be a firewall in the event that he is swamped in Iowa and New Hampshire.
The possibility that the four early states could be won by three or even four different candidates is one big reason that Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, sees an opening for a campaign that skips those four and starts in the states that comprise Super Tuesday in early March.
Is it a coincidence that the more-moderate candidates are doing well in those four early states at a time when Obama was sounding his words of caution? Perhaps. But Obama's warnings about going too far to the left provided some context to the race from the perspective of someone who happens to be the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win more than 50-percent of the national vote in both of his elections. 
What continues to define the Democratic race is the absence of a candidate who has truly captured the imagination of voters. Buttigieg may have come closest, at least among the voters in predominantly white Iowa and New Hampshire. His talent and intellect have certainly generated enthusiasm, marked by sizable crowds as he has campaigned in those states. But he still faces big questions about whether he can expand his appeal, particularly in the African American community.
Sanders has changed hardly a word from his stump speeches of the 2016 campaign, but in response to criticism, he has been trying to show a more-personal side. He has loyal supporters "" and truly loyal contributors "" but he hasn't truly sparked the grass-roots movement he talks about. With many more candidates to choose from, some of his supporters from the last campaign have gone elsewhere.
Warren entered with sizable name recognition but saw her campaign questioned early in the year as she struggled to gain support. Then she became the star of the field during the late summer and early fall, the candidate with detailed plans and a well-regarded field organization in the states. That was at a time when Harris was falling back and Klobuchar and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) were still in single digits. 
Then Warren hit turbulence over health care and fears that her advocacy for a government-run system would make it difficult for her to win a general election on that platform. That's where she is today. She overcame doubts at the beginning of the year and will have to do it again at the end of the year.
Biden has been Biden. He can be underwhelming at times, steady at others. But he still lacks the kind of message that Obama, no doubt, would want to see in a challenger to President Trump. The attributes that have kept him generally atop the national polls are that he is familiar, experienced, well liked in the party and still seen by many Democrats as the candidate with the best chance of winning in 2020. Despite that, he gets little praise from the commentator class on cable television.
Biden's advisers would say he is closer on issues to the Democratic primary electorate than he's given credit for and that his appeal to African Americans (particularly older black voters) and to white working-class voters makes him well positioned for a run against Trump. But talk to party strategists in a state like Iowa and the first thing they say about Biden is that he's generated little enthusiasm as a candidate.
Two months of campaigning remain before the first votes are cast on Feb.-3 in Iowa. In December, impeachment proceedings in the House will overshadow what the candidates do and say; then the holidays will offer voters a possible timeout from everything political. 
In January, an impeachment trial in the Senate could tie up the senators in the race "" Sanders, Warren, Klobuchar, Harris, Booker and Michael F. Bennet (Colo.) "" but notably not Biden or Buttigieg. Whether that gives the non-senators an edge in the weeks when many voters will be making their decisions is the question.
More than in some past campaigns, Democratic voters appear torn between heart and head. Many are looking for a candidate who will inspire them while also being somewhat risk-averse. Those conflicting impulses could be one reason the race seems to shift and shift again and why the answer to the question of what and whom it will take to beat Trump still lies at the center of it all.

DES MOINES "" Sen. Cory Booker, who faces a very real danger of failing to qualify for the next Democratic debate, took sharp aim at his own party Thursday in the aftermath of Sen. Kamala D. Harris's recent exit from the presidential race.
What does it say, Booker asked a roomful of supporters in Iowa, that an 'immensely qualified, widely supported, truly accomplished black woman, running to lead . . . a party that is significantly empowered by black women voters, didn't have the resources that she needed to continue her campaign?'
He added, 'What message is that sending "" that we heralded the most diverse field in our history and now we're seeing people like her dropping out of this campaign?'
As the effects from Harris's departure Tuesday continued to ripple through the Democratic Party, two of the highest-profile candidates of color remaining in the field "" Booker (D-N.J.) and former housing and urban development secretary Julián Castro "" sought to seize the moment. They hope to tap into the concerns voiced by many in the party that a lack of diversity among the top candidates could undermine efforts to mobilize voters of color, who stayed home in record numbers in 2016.
Booker, who is African American, and Castro, who is Latino, have both been outspoken in praising Harris (D-Calif.), their erstwhile rival, appealing to her former supporters who are now shopping around for a new candidate to represent their vision of an inclusive party, hoping the Democrats' self-scrutiny would win their candidacies a second look.
Castro blamed journalists for focusing on which Democrat would be most 'electable,' and suggesting a white man would have the best shot at defeating President Trump.
'The media's flawed formula for 'electability' has pushed aside women and candidates of color,' Castro said on Twitter. 'Our party's diversity is our strength, and it's a shame that we're headed for a December debate without a single person of color.'
And on a campaign swing in California, Castro assailed the media for its coverage of Harris, telling CBS News the press had held her to a 'a different standard, a double standard . . . that was grossly unfair' by focusing on turmoil within her campaign rather than her message.
More broadly, Harris's abrupt exit has spurred Democrats to grapple with the increasing whiteness of their 2020 field, including the possibility the Dec. 19 debate might feature only white candidates. 
With the qualification deadline a week away, the remaining minority candidates in the race "" Booker, Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick and businessman Andrew Yang "" have yet to meet the Democratic National Committee's polling and donor thresholds.
While the Democrats began with a historically diverse field, the candidates who are near the top of most polls "" former vice president Joe Biden, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg "" are white.
Booker said it was not rank-and-file Democrats who pushed Harris from the race, adding, 'Voters did not determine her destiny.' Rather, he argued, it was a flawed process that favors wealthy candidates, who can use their money to goose their polling numbers and spur additional contributions.
'I'm just going to say it plain: It is a problem that we now have an overall campaign for the 2020 presidency that has more billionaires in it than black people,' Booker said at his Des Moines event.
In the crowd, an older black woman nodded and lifted a hand to the air. 
Booker has been especially aggressive on the subject in recent days, speaking about his 'anger' over Harris's exit with reporters and voicing concerns about the debate thresholds with new urgency.
On Tuesday, just hours after Harris's announcement, Booker's campaign added Thursday's speech to a planned four-day, 12-stop swing though Iowa, a state that could determine the fortunes of his struggling presidential bid. 
Booker has invested heavily in his ground game in the state and is banking that a good showing here could propel him with new momentum into other early primary states, essentially the same strategy that worked for Barack Obama in 2008. The senator said he was the only candidate in the race who could assemble the same kind of diverse coalition that pushed Obama to victory 11 years ago.
'This election is about something deeper than any candidate,' Booker said. 'It's about how we can inspire the diverse coalitions we need to inspire.'
In Iowa, Harris, like Booker, had built up a robust organization, including an army of newly energized female supporters who are now up for grabs. During his appearance in Des Moines, Booker was careful not to be seen as capitalizing on Harris's departure, though his message at times was clearly aimed at making inroads with her supporters and other Democrats who are vexed by the party's diversity problem.
Speaking to reporters backstage after his event, Booker recounted the frustration and conflicting emotions he'd felt since Harris quit the race. He said he'd fielded phone calls from women of color who, citing Harris, questioned if they would ever be able to run for office and win.
'Something about the system is not fair if she couldn't even make it to Iowa,' Booker said of Harris.
But Harris's decision to quit the race was also a moment of opportunity for Booker and Castro, who are vying to keep their presidential bids alive. 
Ahead of Booker's speech, his campaign announced that Wednesday was its biggest fundraising day of the race so far, attracting 11,000 new donors. Castro's campaign said he had raised more than $360,000 from 18,000 donors since Harris's exit Tuesday.
But candidates must also hit certain polling targets to qualify, and it's not clear whether Booker or Castro will do that. On Thursday, Booker notably called on his supporters to answer their phones when a pollster called "" acknowledging concerns within his campaign that voters besieged by robocalls are simply ignoring unknown numbers and failing to register support that could be crucial for his campaign.
'We're 1 percentage point in almost all these polls from making the debate stage, which, you know, in a very tight sample size, two people, three people,' Booker told reporters. 'And if you're basing the success of my campaign on a 400-person sample size and three people, your metric is the one that we should be talking about, not mine. I'm basing mine on Iowa voters, Iowa caucusgoers and the kind of campaign that we're building.'
He declined to say what would happen if he failed to qualify for the December debate. 
Nancy Bobo, a Des Moines activist and top Booker supporter, said that she and others who have been knocking on doors on the senator's behalf in recent days had been instructing anyone they encountered to talk to pollsters if they cared about keeping Booker's voice in the race. 
'Answer your phones,' Bobo said. 'Please, please answer your phones.'

House Democrats increasingly expect their impeachment effort against President Trump to stretch well past Thanksgiving, possibly forcing a Senate trial into January or later - a timeline that could disrupt the final weeks of campaigning before their party starts to choose its nominee. 
House leaders had initially hoped to hold a floor vote before the Nov. 28 holiday so the Senate could hold a trial before Christmas. But the surprising number of witnesses agreeing to testify behind closed doors in the Capitol over the past few weeks has extended the timeline and sparked a debate over whether prolonged impeachment proceedings are politically prudent.
Some Democratic strategists have raised concerns that an extended process that bridges the holiday season risks losing the nation's attention or lending credence to Republican claims that Democrats have been distracted from bread-and-butter issues such as health care and job creation on which they focused in the 2018 election.
""The bandwidth and the attention span for it will be hard-pressed once the holiday season is engaged,"" said Dan Sena, a former executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ""I think this is not something people want on their dinner table.""
A January trial also would disrupt the final weeks of campaigning before the Iowa caucuses for candidates who are senators in Washington, while others, including former vice president Joe Biden and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, continued to rally voters on the campaign trail. The Iowa caucuses are Feb. 3.
House leaders plan for the first floor vote in the impeachment inquiry on Thursday in a move to authorize public hearings on the matter and ensure the release of deposition transcripts.
Under the constitutional process, the House can impeach with a simple majority vote. The Senate would then hold a trial, with conviction and removal requiring the votes of two-thirds of the senators present. 
Other strategists have argued that Trump and the Republican Party have reacted so poorly to the impeachment investigation that a drawn-out process could be beneficial to Trump's rivals.
""He has been exhibiting all the behaviors that polling shows makes the voters who decide elections very nervous about him,"" said Dan Pfeiffer, who was a senior White House adviser to President Barack Obama and now co-hosts the ""Pod Save America"" podcast. ""Short-circuiting the investigation to meet an arbitrary deadline is the greater political risk than having it bleed into 2020."" 
On Capitol Hill, interviews with more than a dozen House Democrats revealed their hope to conduct a full investigation, with some expressing concern that the process could extend into January. 
""The end of the year is the deadline still, and I certainly think it ought to happen before Iowa,"" said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a supporter of the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). ""When you run against an incumbent, you have to make the case of why to fire them. The House has done that. But you also have to make the case of how you're going to improve people's lives.""
Others are focusing more on following the facts. 
""I think they should take as long as they need,"" said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii). ""They shouldn't take any extra time. But I don't think there's any magic to Thanksgiving or Christmas. This is a weighty matter, and if it takes several months, so be it.""
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has publicly sided with the latter group, even as the team she has assembled to conduct the inquiry has been moving quickly, repeatedly seeking to avoid judicial involvement that might cause months of delay in an effort to obtain more documents and testimony. 
""The timeline will depend on the truth line,"" Pelosi said on Oct. 17. 
Republicans have repeatedly tried to use time as a weapon to get the upper hand in proceedings. Trump and members of his staff have refused requests for documents and demanded that current and former officials decline House requests for documents. 
Last week, House Republicans tried to disrupt the investigative work, with members storming into a hearing room and delaying a closed-door witness interview. 
So far, the Democratic National Committee and the top presidential campaigns have not weighed in on the timing debate, both because they do not want to politicize the process and because it is difficult to figure out just what an extended process would mean, officials said. 
Several senators running for president, including Kamala D. Harris, a former California state prosecutor, would be likely to try to use a trial of Trump as a showcase for their candidacies. But the trial could also remove them from the campaign trail in early- primary states such as Iowa and New Hampshire just weeks before those jurisdictions vote.
""We have been in uncharted territory for so long, who knows? It could distinguish people or it could complicate things,"" said a top official with one of the Democratic campaigns, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy. 
Some in the Senate have weighed in on a separate debate over expanding the scope of the investigation, another decision that could extend the reach of the process. 
""I think it's important to get it done, get the information you need and move on,"" said Sen. Jon Tester (Mont.), a former chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ""They just got to stay focused on Ukraine, get the information, and then hopefully come to some sort of [decision on] whether they're going to send it over here.""
He said time was a factor, though not a decisive one. 
""I just think it's important that they do their job in a very timely manner - whether it's done by the end of the year or not, I can't say,"" Tester said. ""I would prefer it, but I don't know if that's a killer or not.""
Other Democrats, including Sen. Christopher A. Coons (Del.), House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel (N.Y.) and Rep. Debbie Dingell (Mich.), have echoed Pelosi in resisting an imposed timeline.
""I've heard we need to be done before Thanksgiving, that it needs to be done before Christmas, that it needs to be done before the first primary - it needs to be done when it's done,"" said House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.). ""This has to be a dignified process and a process the American people respect."" 
Hanging over the entire discussion is an awareness of the political nature of impeachment. Although the proceedings have so far been held mostly behind closed doors, leaders of both parties are closely tracking public opinion polls, which since September have shown a clear growth in support for an impeachment investigation and for Trump's removal from office. 
A Washington Post-Schar School poll in early October found that 58 percent of Americans supported opening the inquiry, and 49 percent supported recommending Trump's removal from office. A CNN poll taken between Oct. 17 and 20 similarly found that 50 percent supported removing him from office. 
The strong support for impeachment could put pressure on vulnerable Republican senators, including Cory Gardner (Colo.) and Martha McSally (Ariz.), who recently signed on to a bill that condemns the House impeachment process.

President Trump often regards the stock market as a reflection, equating its extended bull run as the ultimate affirmation. But the same free-market levers that power Wall Street can also serve as a moving referendum on his presidency and all things Washington.
In an era where you can bet on the name of the next royal baby or whether Elvis is still alive, 'prediction markets' such as PredictIt are positioning themselves as serious forecasters of every conceivable political outcome.
PredictIt is a current-events stock exchange that poses hundreds of questions "" each its own 'market' "" at any given time. Users can plunk down as much as $850 to tap the next justice to leave the Supreme Court (Ruth Bader Ginsburg at 73 percent), forecast whether William P. Barr will still be attorney general at year's end (91 percent say yes) or envision a 2020 presidential run by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson (a hard no at 96 percent).
Then there's Trump, whose impeachment battle has dominated the site. The odds of the Democrat-run House of Representatives voting to impeach him stood at 78-percent Wednesday morning, just ahead of the start of public hearings; they'd been as high as 80-percent in October. The site doesn't see the Republican-held Senate voting for conviction. 
John Aristotle Phillips, the Washington-based company's co-founder, contends that the very nature of such platforms is a better picture of what people are thinking than what pollsters can extract from statistics. 
 'When people have a little skin in the game, they are more likely to distill facts from fiction and discount fake news,' he said. 'The theory here is that markets can be effective at pricing future risk.'
An asset's value is based on the size of the trading pool. Traders, much like their Wall Street brethren, make wagers based on their interpretation of news reports, public statements and other factors that can affect performance.
Only one option can be correct, and it's winner-take-all.
Prediction markets seek to harness the 'wisdom of the crowds' "" the theory being that large groups of people are collectively smarter than experts and polls. 
Though PredictIt's spokesman Will Jennings says it's difficult to make a 'blanket accuracy assessment, given the variety of markets,' he said the District-based site's handicappers are correct 70 to 80-percent of the time. It forecast, for example, that Brett M. Kavanaugh would be on the short list to succeed Justice Anthony M. Kennedy on the Supreme Court. It also signaled that Kavanaugh would get the nomination hours before it was formally announced.
Though research generally supports the idea that prediction markets are better forecasters than polls, Justin Wolfers, a University of Michigan professor who has studied prediction markets, said to take that with 'a big asterisk.'
'Saying markets are better than the alternative is not saying markets are perfect. Most ways of predicting the future are bad. It's possible markets are the least bad.'
PredictIt was on the wrong side of Brexit, when Britain invoked its separation from the European Union in a letter from then-Prime Minister Theresa May. Nor did it call Trump's 2016 election victory; it said Democratic rival Hillary Clinton had a 95 percent chance of winning Florida, for example, but she didn't. The site erroneously gave Martha McSally a 92 percent chance of winning Arizona's 2018 U.S. Senate election. The former Air Force pilot lost but was later appointed to the other seat that had been vacated by Sen. Jon Kyl.
PredictIt correctly anticipated that the GOP would win the Senate and Democrats reclaim the House in 2018 midterms, that Milwaukee would host the 2020 Democratic convention, and that Boris Johnson would lead Britain's Conservative Party.
But Washington's political scene dominates the site, where 3,000 active traders are participating in markets every day. 
PredictIt pegs Trump's odds of reelection at 42 percent, which makes him the favorite one year out. As the incumbent, Trump has the historical advantage. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), meanwhile, has a 17 percent chance, former vice president Joe Biden is at 13 percent and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg stands at 12 percent, according to the website.
Trump made his own prediction Tuesday during a speech at the Economic Club of New York. He told the business-friendly crowd that they would vote for him.

'The truth is look, you have no choice, because the people we are running against are crazy,' he said to laughter. 'Okay? They are crazy.'

The Democratic presidential debates generated a lot of interest, especially after the Oct. 15 slugfest. PredictIt carried a number of active markets during that debate and continues to hold markets on who fared the best. Traders forecast that Bernie Sanders would get the biggest bump in the polls and that Biden would slide the most.
Though PredictIt comes across as quiz show meets Caesars Palace sportsbook, the five-year-old site doesn't have bookies and oddsmakers like the sports gambling parlors that populate Las Vegas or local racetracks. There are no 'betting lines' like those found on the Betfair Betting Exchange in Europe. And it's not a traditional pollster.
Rather, it's a gambling-polling hybrid that essentially asks people to back up their political prognostications with money.
'Polling asks you what you hope will happen,' Phillips said. 'Investing in a market is what you actually think will happen.'
PredictIt allows traders to make predictions on future political events by buying 1- to 99-cent shares in binary outcomes. The resulting share price can be read as the probability of a specific event occurring, based on the collective intelligence of the market participants, according to the company.
The odds are set by the traders and what they are willing to pay. If a contract that pays $1 if 'Candidate X' wins an election is currently priced at 53 cents, the market says 'Candidate X' has a 53-percent chance of winning and 47 percent chance that they will lose.

PredictIt's team formulates questions that must have two sides to the bet, known as a 'contract.' Only one option can be correct, and it's $1, winner-take-all.
The staff gathers every Monday to spitball what questions will be irresistible to traders. Will Pope Francis finish out his term? Will 2019 be the hottest year on record? Which party will take crucial swing state Ohio in next year's presidential contest?
Political consultant Pratik Chougule is the author of the 2016 book 'How to Make Money From Political Predictions.' He agrees that prediction markets are more valuable than pundits, talking heads and politicians when it comes to discerning political outcomes. But Chougule said Predict It has deep imperfections because of a demographic dominated by young, highly educated men. They are predisposed, for example, to gravitate to a presidential candidate such as Andrew Yang "" a successful entrepreneur who's polling at about 3 percent "" as opposed to lifetime politicians such as Biden or Sanders. 
'If markets are so rational, why are they putting such a high likelihood of Andrew Yang or Hillary Clinton winning the Democratic nomination,' Chougule said. 'The market is overstating their odds because the people who are betting on political markets are not anywhere near a random sample of the population.'
Most of PredictIt's 200,000 subscribers are well-educated millennial males from large cities on the East and West coasts. They earn $100,000 and $200,000 a year, according to the company. Many are employed in finance, law and politics. Not surprisingly, a big chunk of traders are in the fields of economics, statistics and mathematics.
Phillips, the company's 63-year-old co-founder, first made national news in the 1970s as the 'A-bomb Kid' when he designed an atomic bomb for a seminar while attending Princeton University. The term paper elicited contact from a Pakistani official looking for the plans, sparked attention on the floor of the U.S. Senate and led to a book called 'Mushroom: The True Story of the A-Bomb Kid.'
Phillips later tried his hand at politics, twice unsuccessfully running for a congressional seat in Connecticut. During those campaigns, he spotted a business opportunity to develop technology around political fundraising and election compliance. That led to Aristotle, the company he co-founded with his brother, Dean Phillips, in 1983. Aristotle is the parent of PredictIt.
'Aristotle was a happy byproduct of my congressional campaigns,' he said.
The brothers branched out into political forecasting with Predict It in 2014 after teaming up with Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. Victoria University created and operated the site that Phillips introduced to the United States.
'There are limitations on polling that can somewhat be addressed by something like a market,' Phillips said. The question of whether markets are more accurate than polling has been the subject of intense academic research, and that is why Victoria University was studying it.
The university received a letter from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission giving PredictIt permission to allow trading on the site at a limit of $850 per trade. The cap is designed to stop a trader from skewing the prices by flooding the bets with cash.
'Instead of trying to arrive at a price of oil 12 months from now, you are using the same market forces to ascertain who is going to win an election,' Phillips said.
The company makes money, but not a ton, Phillips said. Its revenue comes from a 10 percent fee on the profit of any trade. There is also a 5 percent fee when a trader withdraws money from their account. There is no charge to open a PredictIt account or to deposit funds.
Jason Hemmendinger, a software engineer and top predictive trader, has been trading since June 2017, when he created a PredictIt account with $40. He said it hit five figures after the 2018 midterms. 
'I have made some mistakes, and I was below $5 at one point, but I kept at it and rebounded,' said Hemmendinger, who is probably more proficient in current events than the average citizen. 
Hemmendinger said his biggest PredictIt 'gets' were predicting that North Korea would participate in the Olympics and that Trump would meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. He also guessed correctly that Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) would be the only Republican to oppose Kavanaugh's nomination.
'It's arrogant to say, but I'm right more often than I feel,' he said. 
Hemmendinger checks dozens of prices every day, and he sometimes spends hours on PredictIt. He isn't sure that the site is a great prediction vehicle, but he enjoys playing the game.
 'Constraints on PredictIt's market structure, combined with participants self-selecting, can lead to distorted prices and therefore profitable plays,' Hemmendinger said. 'You can even tell people the correct play and they will still throw their money away.'

 The knock on Nathan Stang's door came just after 1 p.m. Stang, a doctoral student in music at Indiana University, answered the soft rapping that Friday wearing a blue bathrobe. Standing outside his apartment was a clean-shaven man dressed in beige slacks and a pink, checked shirt.
'Hi, Nathan,' said Brian Shrader, a deputy with the Brown County Sheriff's Department. 'Remember me?'
'Yeah,' Stang replied. It was Shrader who had interviewed him after an appalling act of vandalism at St. David's Episcopal Church, where Stang played the organ and directed the choir. On the Sunday morning after the 2016 election, Stang had discovered the church's walls defaced with black spray paint: a swastika, along with the words 'Heil Trump' and 'Fag Church.'
The graffiti in rural Indiana became a national sensation, part of a string of high-profile hate-crime reports in the wake of Donald Trump's victory. Late-night television host Stephen Colbert featured an image of one of the tagged walls during a monologue. 
The church's priest, the Rev. Kelsey Hutto, appeared on CNN to champion the values of St. David's, an island of liberalism in conservative Brown County. 
'Doing the right thing is not always the popular thing, and if that's why we were targeted, we're okay with that,' she said. 

The church purposely left the graffiti untouched for more than two weeks to send a message that it would not be cowed. Stang played music as the spray paint was finally scrubbed off at a ceremony of healing attended by more than 200 people. But the hatred and distrust behind the markings could not be washed away so easily "" either for the congregation or for its 26-year-old organist. 

As a gay man, Stang had dreaded the unexpected triumph of Trump and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, an ardent opponent of same-sex marriage and other LGBTQ rights. Stang's boyfriend, a professional flutist, had wept after the election results were finalized. 
When Shrader appeared on his doorstep five months later, in April 2017, Stang was struggling with major depression. Over the winter, he had contemplated suicide. His face "" fine-featured and quick to come alive when he sat at the keyboard or stood before a classroom of undergraduates "" was covered in dark stubble.
'Do you have like 5, 10 minutes you could walk out to my car?' Shrader asked. 'Have a seat with me, chat for a few minutes?'
'Sure I could,' Stang replied. 'Do you mind if I put on some clothes?'

A few minutes later the doors of Shrader's unmarked Ford SUV, streaked with rain from the day's intermittent storms, swung shut. 
'All right,' Shrader said, shifting in his seat. 'So, again. Here for the church case.'
Stang, expressionless, watched the 30-year-old detective's face. There had been no arrests for the vandalism, and no outward signs that investigators were making progress. But the case had reached a critical juncture, and though Stang didn't know it, Shrader was surreptitiously recording their conversation. A copy of the video was later provided to The Washington Post.
'I've spent six months on this case, okay? A long time,' Shrader said slowly. He took a breath and placed his right hand, palm down, on the armrest console that separated them.
'Based on what I've found in this investigation,' he told the organist, 'you're responsible for this.'



An unusual crime
Brown County's border lies less than 10 miles from Bloomington, the urbane hub of Indiana's state university system. But across that short distance is an unmistakable political and demographic divide.
Driving east on State Road 46, Bloomington's neat outer subdivisions give way to church steeples, rusting mailboxes and satellite television dishes, a landscape of forested hills and hollows that feels more Appalachian than Midwestern. Many of the county's 15,000 residents embraced the rise of President Trump, who captured 63 percent of the vote. But few of those supporters worshiped at St. David's Episcopal Church. The small congregation welcomed same-sex weddings. Its rector was a woman. God was routinely invoked during sermons with a female pronoun.

To the parishioners who gathered in the parking lot to stare at the graffiti on the morning of Nov.-13, 2016, the motive for the crime "" and its connection to a season of political vitriol "" seemed obvious. Jim Huber, the church's senior warden, found his thoughts turning to a nearby property flying a Confederate flag. Michael Day, a retired doctor, felt an upswell of righteous anger. 'My attitude was, 'This is my church family. My family has been hurt,' ' Day recalled. 'I was ready to go out Nazi-hunting.'
But to Shrader, the first officer on the scene that morning, the circumstances of the crime didn't seem so clear-cut. The son of a brick mason, Shrader never finished college. But beneath his boyish features and deliberate, almost plodding manner was a knack for seeing things others overlook. As he took statements and scoured the scene in vain for useful physical evidence, something seemed off to him. 
The crime was highly unusual in Brown County, where residents prided themselves on their neighborly ways. In heavily touristed Nashville, the county seat, the glass blower could be found just down the street from the gun seller.
'You believe what you believe. I believe what I believe. We just don't talk politics,' said Sandra Higgins, a local township trustee and Trump supporter who, along with her grandson, helped to scrub the graffiti from the walls of St. David's.
But something else was nagging Shrader, and as the first day of the investigation drew to a close it finally hit him. He called his boss, Sheriff Scott Southerland. 
'Did you know that church performed gay marriages?' Shrader recalled asking Southerland, who replied that he did not.
The detective had put his finger on what was bothering him: the words 'Fag Church.' St. David's was indeed a beacon of support for gay rights. But the fact had gone all but unnoticed outside the church's several dozen parishioners. 
'I didn't know that. People in the county didn't know that. People I work with didn't know that. Someone 'down the road,' so to speak, really would not have known that,' Shrader said. He began to wonder if the hateful graffiti could have been scrawled Saturday night by somebody who planned to sit in the pews Sunday morning.



A prime suspect emerges
Real hate crimes far outnumber fake ones. Exact estimates vary, but academic researchers put the number of confirmed hate hoaxes in 2016 in the dozens "" a tiny fraction of the 6,121 crimes of bias reported that year to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
But when they do occur, they invariably generate intense publicity "" stoking denunciations by those who say they damage the credibility of legitimate hate-crime victims and fueling assertions by others that most bias-motivated attacks are fake. 
'In real life, hate crimes are rare,' Fox News host Tucker Carlson argued during a segment earlier this year. 'Hate hoaxes, by contrast, are common.'
Carlson was commenting on the Trump era's most notorious alleged hoax: black actor Jussie Smollett's claim that he was attacked in Chicago by men who beat him and placed a noose around his neck while invoking the president's 'Make America Great Again' campaign slogan. Police said Smollett staged the incident, an accusation the actor denies.

The episode evoked another famous hate hoax. In 1987, Tawana Brawley, a black teenager from Wappingers Falls, N.Y., was found seemingly unconscious in a garbage bag, racial slurs written on her body. She alleged that a group of white men, including a police officer, had raped her. Civil rights activists, including the young Rev. Al Sharpton, took up her cause, but a grand jury concluded a year later that the story was untrue and that Brawley's condition may have been 'self-inflicted.'
Falsified displays of bigotry have been particularly explosive on college campuses, from Bowling Green State University to the Air Force Academy to Kansas State University, where activists and administrators denounced racist incidents that were later revealed to be hoaxes.

'Each one of these cases that happen is cited as a reason we shouldn't have hate-crime legislation "" that all hate crimes are made up,' said Jack McDevitt, director of the Institute on Race and Justice at Northeastern University. 
The reality, he added, is very different: Many hate-crime victims are afraid to go to police. 'The problem is underreporting, not overreporting,' McDevitt said.

Shrader had no experience with hate crimes, let alone hate hoaxes, when he began investigating the vandalism at St. David's. The sheriff's office subpoenaed records from a cellular tower near the church, and Shrader painstakingly sifted through the numbers of those whose phones had sent or received data in the area on Saturday night and Sunday morning.
Checking those records against the phone numbers of people connected to the congregation, Shrader found a match. 
Nathan Stang wasn't a longtime member of St. David's. He didn't even believe in God. He was the church's paid organist, a job he'd held for less than a year. Church leaders admired his mastery of sacred music, and the young composer had become a favorite among members of the choir. 
On the morning he found the graffiti, the organist said nothing to Shrader about being in Bean Blossom the previous night. About a month after Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017, the detective briefly questioned Stang again, disguising the interview as a routine follow-up. 
When Stang denied being in Brown County on Saturday, he became Shrader's prime suspect. The detective now believed the gay organist had desecrated his own church with homophobic graffiti. 
He just didn't know why. 



'You going in, Mom?'
Stang's path to a church in the hills of Indiana began in Vero Beach, Fla. As a child, he would wrap his arms around his mother's neck and watch as she played Air Fortress on the original Nintendo Entertainment System. Rhonda Stang separated from her husband when Nathan was 3, and those gaming sessions helped cement an intense bond between mother and son.
'When I started to land the spaceship, he would be hanging on to me, and he would say, 'You going in, Mom?' ' Rhonda, now 55, recalled. 'And I would say, 'Yeah, I'm going in.' '
When he was old enough to play games himself, Stang fell in love with the Zelda and Mega Man franchises. In high school, he began trying to re-create games' soundtracks on his tuba. Those youthful acts of musical mimicry would transform Stang's life and define his career.
He became a standout in the high school band and orchestra; then a music major at Stetson University; then a composition student in the master's program at the Eastman School of Music, one of the nation's top conservatories, in Rochester, N.Y. 

In his 20s he won awards for a body of works that ranged from 'Undertow,' a brooding rejoinder to Claude Debussy's languid 'La Mer,' to 'Side-scroller,' an orchestral homage to the games of his childhood that incorporated the Super Mario Bros. theme. Arriving at Indiana University to pursue his PhD in music composition, he created and taught a popular course on video game music in which undergraduates could be found listening to their charismatic young instructor discuss melodic shapes in scenes of monster-slaying.
'He is one of the most talented musicians I know,' said Jay Hurst, a fellow IU doctoral student and composer.
At Eastman and at IU, Stang thrived socially, making friends whose interests, from Prokofiev to PlayStation, matched his own. But his relationship with his mother began to fray. In temperament and intellectual interests, Rhonda "" an extroverted newspaper ad clerk "" was very different from her son. Still, for as long as Stang could remember, she had been his closest friend and confidante. 

'I used to trust her with anything, and talk to her about anything,' he recalled.
He had come out in 2008, when he arrived at Stetson. Though his mother had long suspected he was gay, she struggled to accept it. She dreamed of grandchildren, and a devoted daughter-in-law. She worried about her son being persecuted.
'I have no problem with anyone being gay,' she said. 'But it was a little different when it came to my own kid.' 
Yet it was politics, not sexual identity, that drove mother and son apart.
When Barack Obama was elected, Rhonda embraced the tea party movement. She began to fear that the U.S. government was dominated by a network of shadowy, corrupt elites bent on enriching themselves and destroying citizens' freedoms. She wept when Obama won a second term, and as his presidency came to a close, she began trying to interest Stang in strange theories she discovered on YouTube. 
By then, she was living with him in Bloomington after renting out her house in Florida. Arriving home from work or class, the doctoral student would listen in astonishment as his mother discussed the possibility that the U.S. government was secretly promoting homosexuality in its citizens through chemicals placed in tap water, or that Queen Elizabeth II and other world leaders are disguised envoys of the Anunnaki, an extraterrestrial race of lizard people. 

Rhonda acknowledged that the ideas were far-fetched but said she found them intellectually stimulating. 'What's the old saying, that truth is stranger than fiction?' She said. 'No, I don't necessarily believe [the queen is] a lizard person. But I like tossing around the idea.'
After several months, Rhonda moved to Tennessee. Not long afterward she adopted another belief that astounded her son, and would prove to be his breaking point. She thought Trump should be president.
Furious, Stang posted a meme on her Facebook page linking Trump to Nazism and displaying a swastika. She deleted it and posted a video by conspiracy-monger Alex Jones insulting Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), her son's preferred candidate.
As the election neared, Stang gradually stopped responding to his mother's calls and text messages. Looking back, Rhonda said, she failed to grasp what her embrace of the Trump-Pence ticket meant to him. 
'I don't know if he thought he was going to get rounded up or what,' she said. 'I don't know, because he was barely communicating with me at all.'
The first time she spoke to her son after the election was when he called her on Sunday to recount the vandalism at St. David's. As he described the words scrawled on the church, Rhonda found herself unable to share his alarm. 
No Trump supporter would write those things, she assured him. It had to be a hoax. 



'Irrefutable evidence'
'How?'
As he sat in Shrader's SUV five months later, it was the only word Stang could muster in response to the detective's accusation that he'd committed the crime. He leaned back into the passenger's seat, as though trying to recede from view. 
'I'm not here to arrest you or anything like that today,' Shrader said. 'In fact, you can get out anytime you want to, okay? But the reason I'm here is I feel like you and I can sort it out.'
The detective paused.
'The case has been stressful,' he said. 'Needless to say, it's been stressful for me. For a lot of different people. When I think about this case, I think, what would make someone like you "" or, really, anybody "" do this, right? And I think you're either the person that's hateful, doesn't like churches, doesn't like gay individuals . . . '
'I'm a gay individual myself,' Stang said.
Shrader told Stang his sister was gay, too. He talked about the turbulent emotions that followed Trump's election.

'People were scared, my sister included,' he said. 'And I think that someone could get to the point where they just make a spur-of-the-moment decision that's not of their character. . . . They do something like this out of fear. . . . My sister cried, you know, for several days. And I think that that's something that went through you. That's why I'm here.'
'Do you mind if I ask what leads you to believe all of this?' Stang asked.
'There's irrefutable evidence that you were there Saturday night. You were at the church Saturday night.'
'What evidence is that?'
'I'm not even [going to] get into all of it,' Shrader said. 'I can tell you that we pulled surveillance vid. . . ' Shrader stopped before the word was fully out of his mouth. Then he resumed: 'You've got to understand, the FBI got involved in this case, okay? So they have a lot more avenues, they're a lot smarter people than I am at pulling different evidence from wherever. Cellphone technology shows where people go at given times.' 

Shrader's words were a mix of truths and lies, pressure and patience, sympathy and ruthlessness. His sister was in fact a lesbian alarmed by Trump, but to his knowledge she had never shed tears about it. ('My sister is not a very emotional person,' he later explained.) Cellphone data indicated Stang had been in Bean Blossom on Saturday night, but there was no surveillance video, and the FBI had never come in on the case. 
Most of all, the detective deceived the organist about the purpose of his visit. He knew Stang had no criminal record, and believed he was a good guy who had committed an impulsive act. But he wasn't there to help him. 
On that Friday in April 2017, Shrader had come to Bloomington because after consultation with a prosecutor he believed the cellphone evidence he possessed was insufficient to bring charges. 

Pushing Stang to confess "" and recording it on the camera disguised as a fob on his keychain "" was his last chance at solving his case.
Stang was now staring vacantly in the direction of the SUV's glove compartment. He had tried to leave behind his emotions from that week. The fear of what might happen after the graffiti was found. The devastating conversation with his mother, who refused to acknowledge the meaning of the words scrawled on his church's walls "" who hadn't even asked if he was okay. 
When Shrader spoke again, his voice was quiet.
'Where did the paint come from?'
Stang raised his eyes and stared straight ahead, through the windshield. 'From Bloomington Hardware, down the street here,' he said. 'I was just so f-----g "" I was just terrified.'
Stang had answered Shrader's question. Now he looked at the detective with a question of his own.
'What's going to happen to me?'



'A state of shock'
Five days later, Stang's boyfriend received a cryptic text message. Stang was asking to be picked up in Nashville, not far from St. David's. Eric Bowling, an easygoing flutist in the Bloomington Symphony Orchestra, guessed Stang's car had broken down. 
When Bowling arrived and learned the truth, he was speechless. 
Earlier that day, Shrader had showed up for the third and last time at Stang's apartment. The detective left the handcuffs off till Stang stepped into his cruiser for the ride to the Brown County Jail. Stang was fingerprinted and photographed before he was released on a $1,500 bond for a misdemeanor charge of institutional criminal mischief. 
Bowling steered the car back toward Bloomington in what he later described as 'a state of shock.' Stang begged him to say something, and Bowling eventually did, telling him he needed to hire a lawyer and delete his social media accounts. His boyfriend's hate-crime hoax, he suspected, would be national news.

He was right. That night, as a TV news crew prowled the parking lot outside Stang's apartment, Bowling sat in the corner while a group of Stang's friends gathered to hear him explain what he had done. What Stang offered, as they choked back their anger and tears, was a version of the formal statement he had written after Shrader's visit.
He was frightened, he wrote, by Trump's rhetoric. 'I felt very scared and alone and, at the time, really didn't know why I was doing what I was doing. I suppose I wanted to give local people a reason to fight for good, even if it was a false flag. I of course realize now that this was not the way to go about inspiring activism.'
But that explanation was in one sense misleading. Local people were not his prime audience.
'If there was someone I was trying to get the attention of,' he says now, 'it would be my mom.'
In that effort, he succeeded.
After learning about her son's arrest on the Internet, Rhonda drove six hours to Bloomington from Tennessee. She showed up at the office of the real estate company where Stang worked and demanded to see him. When he refused, she waited outside his apartment. He came home and threatened to call the police if she didn't leave. She careened out of the parking lot, screaming that she had a gun (she didn't) and was on her way to shoot herself at St. David's (she wasn't). 
'I was being very mean and crazy,' Rhonda said. 'I was, like, obviously we have a problem here. My son faked a hate crime and was on national TV . . . so, yeah, I felt like we had something to talk about.' 
She drove back to Tennessee feeling utterly betrayed "" and not just because her son had set out to portray those who shared her political views as bigots. Worse, she said, was that he refused to discuss with her what had happened. 
'I guess I thought I was the one person that would be the one he should, would, could talk to,' she said. 'But he's a grown-up man, and I was not the chosen one. And that devastated me, quite honestly.'

Back in Bloomington, Bowling took some time to think about his future with Stang. The crime itself was shocking: the painful homophobic slur, the damage Stang had done to victims of real hate crimes by handing a talking point to those seeking to delegitimize them. But even more unsettling were the months of deception that had followed. How could he trust Stang again, in matters big or small? 
Bowling talked to his parents. He talked to his friends. He remembered his history with Stang, how he had asked him to drinks the first time they met, despite suspecting he was straight. He thought about the secrets everyone keeps, the limits to how fully one person can know another. And then he decided to give his boyfriend another chance. 
It was the first of many acts of forgiveness Stang would experience. But it came with a condition.
'You have to go to all the communities that you've affected,' Bowling recalled saying to him, 'and make things right.'



Seeking forgiveness
'Eternal God, Heavenly Father, you have graciously accepted us . . . '
The timeworn words from the Book of Common Prayer echoed in the nave of St. David's. The last of the day's pale autumn light illuminated the apse, with its wall-length purple tapestries and cross of oak. Two white-haired worshipers stood at the altar to receive the Eucharist from the Rev. Mary Bargiel, a part-time pastor who had driven down from Indianapolis before the Wednesday evening service. 
Otherwise, the church was empty. Shadows gathered in the recesses of the boxy pipe organ where Stang had once presided over the church's small but enthusiastic choir. 
Much had changed at St. David's in the three years since Stang called Hutto, the church's priest, to describe a crime he had secretly committed. There was the new rector, Bargiel, who had replaced Hutto; a new organist who studied, like Stang, at IU's Jacobs School of Music. 
What had not changed was the struggle of an aging congregation to attract new members. A single child had attended worship the previous Sunday, seated amid two dozen adults, most of them past middle age. At a time of political and religious certainty, Sean Hannity and Rachel Maddow, celebrity pastors and nondenominational megachurches, the quiet tolerance and familiar rituals found at St. David's were facing extinction. But they appealed deeply to Jan Benham, a retired doctor who was one of the two people taking Holy Communion on this October evening.

'If anything smells of certitude, I tend to run the other direction,' said Benham, 78, who has worshiped at St. David's for 14-years. 'I don't believe anyone is lost forever. I don't believe in hell, and I may not believe in a literal heaven.' 
A member of the choir, Benham was close to Stang, and felt the sting of betrayal when she learned he was responsible for the violation of the church. But she also felt remorse that neither she nor her fellow parishioners had recognized the pain that drove him to his crime. 
St. David's leaders fired Stang after his arrest. But when the time came for him to be sentenced, they sent an extraordinary letter to the judge and prosecutor that was less a recommendation on Stang's punishment than a confession of the congregation's own sins.
Members of the church council wrote that they had 'looked within ourselves to find ourselves guilty of assuming it was done by a 'certain sort of person.' ' 

'We forgave Nathan,' the letter continued, 'then found we also had to forgive ourselves. We discovered ourselves guilty of the same prejudice we silently accused others of.' 
They concluded by acknowledging 'a lack of consensus' within the congregation on whether Stang should face further consequences in the legal system for his actions: 'Some feel that Nathan has shown genuine remorse, has suffered professionally and personally, and should receive no additional punishment. Others feel the need for further accountability. All strongly believe that the prosecutor and judge should take Nathan's confession, state of mind and expressions of remorse into account during sentencing.' 
In June 2018, a Brown County judge sentenced Stang to 300-hours of community service. It was a large amount, but less than the 30 days of jail time sought by Ted Adams, the county's elected prosecutor. 

Adams, a Republican, still thinks Stang should have served time for an act that 'turned 65-percent of the county against 35 percent of the county for no need.' He also believes Stang's crime was abetted, in a sense, by reporters too ready to embrace a caricature of Trump voters. The prosecutor ultimately called or emailed 92 news organizations that initially covered the vandalism as a hate crime, asking that they update their stories.
'Our media outlets "" I don't care what side you're on "" they actually pump people up with fear,' Adams said. 'That's why this case frustrates me. It just shows where we are at in this society.'



The definition of grace
Although Stang avoided 30-days in jail, he would spend many months trying to atone for what he had done. 
Some of that work was court-ordered, some voluntary. He collected trash, cleaned toilets and did other maintenance jobs for 150 hours in Brown County State Park. He wrote a letter of apology, published in the Bloomington Herald-Times, and volunteered at a Jewish community center on campus. He traveled twice to Puerto Rico to provide hurricane relief on trips organized by Canterbury House, IU's Episcopal ministry, where he also volunteered and would eventually become the chapel's keyboard player.
'I want to be really clear "" I have never excused what he did,' said the Rev. Linda Johnson, the university's Episcopal chaplain and head of Canterbury House, who has mentored Stang through his efforts. Nevertheless, she said, the vandalism should not be judged outside the mistrust and hatred that she sees contaminating politics and the country.
'It was a complex event, from my perspective; very, very complex,' she said. 'And one that could have totally ruined his career. And yet it has not.'
Although he is not religious, Stang speaks with reverence about the forgiveness shown by those who might have condemned him "" by Bowling, who now lives with Stang at a house in southeast Bloomington; by the real estate company that still employs him and the university where he is still working toward his doctorate; most of all, by the parishioners of St. David's. 

After his sentencing, Stang returned to Bean Blossom to try to explain himself to the church's lay leaders. It was another confession "" not the kind extracted from a suspect in a parked police cruiser, but the beginning of penitence and reconciliation according to the traditions of the Episcopal Church.
The council of St. David's listened. Some asked why he had not felt comfortable talking to them about his anguish after the election. But they expressed no anger "" just grief, bewilderment and, ultimately, compassion.
'It was shocking,' he said. 'I feel like that's one of the better definitions of grace I've ever seen in my life.'
Having experienced forgiveness he did not expect and is still not sure he merits, Stang said he now tries to forgive others "" to refrain from judging those whose desperate acts show up in the news, or whose political convictions differ from his own. But for a long time, there was one person with whom he did not reconcile: his mother.
In therapy, he had learned to avoid situations that could deepen his anxiety and depression. Contact with Rhonda, he believed, was too risky. 
He blocked her from his cellphone. Eventually, she began emailing him. 
'Cutting me out completely like this is just inflicting pain on me I don't understand,' she wrote.
'I'm not doing this because I think you deserve pain,' Stang wrote back. 'I'm doing this because I need to be healthier, and-this is the best way for me to do it. . . . 
'The things you said when you came up here really hurt me, especially that you called me crazy/insane and a [screw-up]. You made it clear in the things you said that you haven't fully understood what effects some of your decisions have had on me and those around you. Please think about this and stop it with the martyr stuff.'
He concluded, 'Please don't reply to this email.'

But Rhonda did reply. This time it was simply the word, 'Hey,' followed by a string of 63 seemingly unconnected emoji: hearts, cats, a video game controller, a joint of meat, various facial expressions. Though she had not respected his request to stay away, Stang couldn't help but feel bemused. 
'I can't tell if you've been hacked or you're trying to send a message in code,' he responded. 'If you have something you need to tell me, then tell me, otherwise please leave me alone.'
Rhonda wrote back: 'Yes, I was trying to send a message in code . . . I was trying to say Hey, ding ding, a message to tell you I love you, I'm blue, my heart is broken . . . remember I am your mom and you are my child, can we talk soon?' 
She reminded him of how they used to play 'The Legend of Zelda' together. She asked about his plans for Thanksgiving and Christmas. She asked about Bingo, his cat.
She asked if they could make peace. 
'I'm yelling for you, can you hear me? Praying for peace, I want to punch you for pushing me away. crying, mad, frustrated, don't know what to do.'
It took Stang a few days to digest his mom's email. He knew that she had not been hacked: In style and substance, this was a message only Rhonda could have written. So different from the intricately structured music he created or the artful observations he offered to classrooms full of college students. But perhaps not so different from what he was struggling to say on the night he stood outside an empty church clutching a can of black spray paint.

I'm yelling for you, can you hear me?

Stang picked up the phone.

Drift toward centrism in the Democratic field frustrates some liberals


GRINNELL, Iowa "" When news first spread that a young, openly gay mayor from Indiana was running for president, the liberal potential of his candidacy seemed limitless: Pete Buttigieg supported Medicare-for-all, preached urgency on climate change, and demanded actions such as abolishing the electoral college and overhauling the Supreme Court.
Eleven months later, Buttigieg looks more like a traditional centrist than a leftist force. Instead of Medicare-for-all, he favors a more limited public option. Environmentalists complain that his climate plan is less sweeping than his early rhetoric suggested it might be. After raising his hand at a debate to show support for decriminalizing border crossings, he clarified that he doesn't actually hold that position.
The shifts reflect in part the broader trajectory of the Democratic primary, which initially appeared to herald a dramatic leftward surge. The center of gravity is settling in a less revolutionary place. Many liberals "" at first excited by Buttigieg and the change he promised "" now see him as embodying a dynamic they find deeply frustrating. 
The evolution is arguably working for Buttigieg, who regularly polls in the top tier of the Democratic candidates. But it has also given rise to complaints that the mayor of South Bend, Ind., is carefully calculating his positions rather than passionately expressing his principles.

The tension has begun flaring up regularly on the campaign trail. Some of Buttigieg's former supporters are even using Twitter to ask for their donations back, deploying the hashtag #RefundPete.
At a recent campaign event at Iowa's Grinnell College, when Buttigieg's aides signaled it was time to wrap up, the candidate instead turned to a group that had been holding signs in the front row and asked resignedly, 'Do you want to do the thing?'
They stood and held up sheets with protest messages, which Buttigieg read off one by one before responding. 'Wall Street Pete' said one; Buttigieg shot back, 'They said the same thing about Obama.' Another said 'You will kill us'; Buttigieg answered, 'That's mean. I'm here to help.'

Buttigieg is not alone among the Democrats in scooting toward the center. While Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has maintained his left-leaning positions "" and even amplified them "" much of the rest of the field has slid away from him. 
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), while still a forceful liberal, has backed away from her unconditional support for Medicare-for-all. Before dropping out, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) moved from campaigning as an outspoken liberal to touting more centrist credentials. Former vice president Joe Biden, a centrist who many thought would struggle, has instead maintained a strong position in the polls.
But it is Buttigieg who is prompting the most 'animosity,' said Jonathan Westin, executive director of New York Communities for Change, adding that his members are 'completely offended' by how the mayor is campaigning. 
'I think it just gets down to a lot of the doublespeak Mayor Pete has been doing throughout the campaign,' Westin said. 'Saying he is for Medicare-for-all, then walking back, changing his position on issues, claiming to be the millennial change candidate while at the same time cozying up to billionaire donors. He's running a really insider campaign, and it speaks to how he would govern if he were elected.'

Buttigieg's campaign brushes off such complaints as 'noise,' coming from people whose views do not represent the broader electorate.
'We're not focused on the small echo chamber of Washington insiders talking to each other on Twitter,' Buttigieg spokesman Chris Meagher said. 'We're focused on talking to voters about the issues that matter most to voters.'
Buttigieg himself called the vocal opposition he has encountered 'a little strange,' telling The Washington Post's Robert Costa in a recent interview, 'I think that I broadly share the same values and goals as a lot of these folks. It's a little hard to have a conversation with them, so, I don't know for sure.'
He added, 'Part of our democratic process, in all of its messy beauty, is that individuals can choose whether they're going to focus on supporting a candidate they believe in, or coming to something you're doing and holding up a sign or chanting.'

The liberal frustration, however, comes partly from a sense that Buttigieg espoused more progressive positions as he launched his campaign but abandoned them when it became expedient, as he transformed from boundary breaker to actual contender.
How much he has moved depends on where people saw him in the first place. Early on, Buttigieg rolled out few policy specifics, instead signaling a generally activist approach by urging reform of the Supreme Court and the electoral college. 
In part, that was practical: While some of his opponents boasted seasoned campaign operations growing out of long political careers, Buttigieg, the mayor of a medium-sized city, started with a bare-bones operation. But the unknowns allowed voters to project their own perceptions onto him.
What many of those voters saw was an eloquent 37-year-old, a thoughtful mayor and veteran who would be the youngest person ever to serve as president. Others saw a proudly married gay man who could help turn the page on a long-standing prejudice. 
It was only later in the year that Buttigieg filled in the blanks with more detailed policy proposals. His first major speech on the economy did not come until late July. His plan to address gun violence followed in early August. He outlined details of his health plan in mid-September, months after some of his rivals.
As the plans fleshed out, they often showed a centrist tilt. Buttigieg's climate plan, for example, envisions up to $2-trillion in investment, compared to $16-trillion for Sanders "" though Buttigieg regularly says that the effectiveness of a plan should not be measured in its costliness.
The Sunrise Movement, a climate group, which had praised Buttigieg's rhetoric on a Green New Deal in March, staged a sit-in at his South Bend office in November, saying his climate plan for the city demonstrated too little urgency. The group has also protested his national plan.

Even Buttigieg's handling of his sexuality has become a source of frustration for those disappointed he has not spoken out more forcefully on LGBT rights. Brian Gaither, co-founder of Maryland LGBT PAC, donated to Buttigieg at the beginning of his campaign, but he has now asked for a refund and added #NeverPete to his Twitter profile.
Gaither said he feels 'conned,' adding that he wished Buttigieg spoke more clearly about his sexuality "" the most groundbreaking aspect of his candidacy "" instead of making relatively vague references to his 'marriage' or 'marrying a teacher.'
'It's not that he has to be obligated to be activist of the year, but there seems to be a very specific distancing of himself from any obligation to be concerned or know about those things,' Gaither said. 'It's really hard to understand where he wants to be, other than to use the opportunity to be the first openly gay candidate as a way for his campaign to have significance and meaning it otherwise would not have.'
Federal Election Commission reports show Buttigieg has spent three times as much on polling as any other candidate in the field, much of it conducted by the Benenson Strategy Group, which also polled for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. 
The group began conducting focus groups for Buttigieg last summer, and many of his big policy initiatives "" a 'Douglass plan' on racial justice, a proposed public option on health care "" arrived after that polling began. That timeline has fed into the liberal complaints that Buttigieg is a political weather vane. 
His shift on health care "" not unique in this field "" is particularly clear. In 2018, Buttigieg tweeted his full support for Medicare-for-all. Throughout 2019, the campaign told The Post, which is tracking the candidates' positions, that he was supporting 'some version of Medicare-for-all.' But earlier this month, aides said that should be changed to 'prefers a public option.' 

Buttigieg's backers say such adjustments do not amount to flip-flopping, but rather to defining with more nuance how best to accomplish broadly liberal goals. They also say that if elected, Buttigieg would still be the most liberal president in decades. 
'To the extent that he has veered at all, I would ascribe it more to a combination of the inherent nature of a campaign and they have become more sophisticated in defining the campaign,' said one supporter close to Buttigieg's senior staff, who requested anonymity to speak more freely. 'Any candidate who has a chance to win does that.'
The Buttigieg campaign has also responded to some of the critiques, especially those voiced by Warren, with whom he is locked in a fierce battle for white, college-educated voters that make up a large portion of their shared base. After she criticized him for not being transparent, Buttigieg opened his fundraisers to reporters and disclosed a list of his clients when he worked as a consultant after college.
But if Buttigieg has altered some messaging, his policy substance now places him squarely in the centrist faction of the Democratic field. That puts him in the same camp as Biden, and it distances him from Warren and Sanders.
It also means Buttigieg has in effect taken sides in the big debate dividing the Democratic Party "" whether to focus on energizing the liberal base or reaching out to the center. 
Some centrists think he has made the right call.

'I think you just have to hold the line,' said Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who ended his own presidential campaign in October. 'We can't get thrown off with some of these positions that aren't going to play well in the states we need to win. Decriminalizing at the border, free health care for undocumented workers "" all of those are positions that make it very, very difficult to win in these states.'

A tweet from liberal activists touting Elizabeth Warren drew what seemed like a typical response from one of the Democratic presidential candidate's fans this September:
'Thank you for endorsing Elizabeth Warren!!!' the user wrote, sharing a photo of black women holding 'African Americans with Warren' signs.
The post gained only a single retweet at the time. But it found new life this past weekend, making its way to sharp-eyed Twitter users who realized it was fake, with the campaign placards photoshopped over 'Black Lives Matter' signs.
Twitter users seized on a side-by-side comparison of the doctored version and the original, assailing the Warren campaign for the apparent misrepresentation. What they did not realize was that the account that had propagated the photo has been identified by the Warren campaign as a 'troll,' only feigning support for the Massachusetts Democrat as it pushed out falsified content in an apparent effort to undermine her candidacy.
As the image solidified negative views of Warren among some already favoring other Democratic candidates, the incident offered a fresh lesson about political disinformation: Homespun operations on social media represent a rising threat, capable of inciting conflict among voters and turning unwitting users into agents of online deception.
Four years after Russian agents weaponized social media during the 2016 election, tech giants are grappling not just with foreign meddling but also with falsehoods spread by less sophisticated, and frequently U.S.-based, online sources. Such actors already have circulated misleading posts, doctored photos and manipulated video around the 2020 race.
The threat is especially acute as Twitter and its Silicon Valley peers maintain a mostly hands-off approach to deceptively edited content, so long as the originating account isn't engaging in behavior designed to 'artificially amplify or suppress information,' as Twitter's rules provide.
Relying on the anonymity and amplification that social media offers, such subterfuge 'doesn't necessarily change minds, but it certainly pushes us farther apart and it entrenches us in our existing positions,' said Darren Linvill, an associate professor at Clemson University who studies disinformation. 'With these little homegrown cases that are clearly fake, and that a reasonable person can observe to be fake, someone who is already inclined to believe that thing is going to believe it.'
Social media giants say they are not arbiters of truth, and in the past, Twitter has argued that the conversation around misleading or incorrect tweets can surface much-needed context for users without requiring the company to intervene.
But 2020 Democratic candidates have warned that they lack the tools to counter disinformation in real time. While the manipulated photo distributed by the suspect supporter account gained only moderate traction, its spread still has raised fears about what might happen if a more significant falsehood reverberated more widely.
In this case, early detection of the account responsible for the deceptive post had little benefit.
'Our campaign has reported this account, including this specific photo, several times before and Twitter has refused to take it down because, according to them, it does not violate their guidelines,' Chris Hayden, a spokesman for the Warren campaign, said, calling the Twitter persona a 'troll account that has no affiliation with the Warren campaign.'
Twitter declined to answer specific questions about the account, including whether it was in fact operating from the United States. The account lists its location as Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. The user did not respond to a message sent over the site on Sunday.
A Twitter spokeswoman, Katie Rosborough, offered only a general statement on the episode. 'All presidential campaigns have been offered the same level of support, including how to report issues,' she said.
It's hardly the first time the platform has opted not to erase plainly false material designed to undermine a 2020 candidate. In September, Twitter said it would not scrub its platform of a conspiracy theory falsely tying Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman who ended his presidential bid earlier this month, to a gunman who killed seven people in two west Texas towns. That decision drew a rebuke from O'Rourke's campaign manager, Jen O'Malley Dillon, who sent letters to major tech firms imploring them to do more to root out disinformation. 'This is your job, not ours,' she wrote.
The issue reaches beyond the presidential race, flaring up as well in other vexed partisan debates. Last spring, Twitter declined to remove a video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that made her appear drunk, even after the social media platform acknowledged it had been manipulated.
Over the weekend, a doctored photo of Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and architect of the impeachment inquiry, spread on both Twitter and Facebook. In the altered version, the cropped head of Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender who died by suicide in August, was placed over the head of Schiff's father, who had posed with his son for a photograph originally posted by the Democratic lawmaker last Thanksgiving. Some users took it upon themselves to post the word 'fake' over the doctored photo, but others continued this week to share the false smear.
The Warren incident began on Sept. 30, when the Working Families Party sent a tweet touting the Massachusetts Democrat, whom the party had endorsed, as well as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), also a candidate for the White House. Soon, a jubilant response arrived from @HelenManfred, an account with a small following that features what appears to be a manipulated image of a Warren look-alike as its header photo.
Using exaggerated language, the account predicted that working families, and people of color in particular, 'are starting to SEE that she has a PLAN for them and they will GET ON BOARD!!!'
Included in the tweet was the doctored photo of the Black Lives Matter protest, which the account has since shared multiple times.
Over the weekend, the photo found its way to a supporter of Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), one of Warren's rivals for the Democratic nomination. The supporter, Leaundra Ross of El Paso, paired the doctored photo with the original and blasted it out to her nearly 5,000 followers. She called attention to the inclusion in the doctored photo of an image of 'Charlamagne tha God,' the stage name of Lenard Larry McKelvey, a radio personality with more than 2 million Twitter followers and 126,000 YouTube subscribers. McKelvey famously confronted Warren during an interview about her claims of Native American ancestry.
'Y'all,' Ross wrote. 'This photoshop is a mess.'
Within several hours, the tweet expressing Ross's outrage had gained well over 1,000 interactions, including a string of comments assailing the Warren campaign for the apparent misrepresentation. Ross warned her followers that the photoshop was too poor to be an official production of the campaign. But some of her followers had already drawn their own conclusions. It was reposted by other Harris supporters, some of whom blamed Warren directly. 'These are so much worse than her crazy lies about her plans,' one user wrote.
Meanwhile, Ross did not realize she had spread disinformation targeting a Democratic candidate.
'I posted it because it was funny and laughable and looked fake,' Ross said, speculating that the edited photo may have come from a well-meaning supporter when, in fact, a review of the account's posts makes clear it is posing as a Warren fan to sow doubts about her campaign and spotlight apparent faults with her candidacy "" as well as those of other 2020 hopefuls. 'Warren 2020,' the user's bio reads.

DES MOINES - Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign scheduled a rally here on a recent Saturday night, setting up a choice for local Democrats: see the mayor of South Bend, Ind., or watch a nationally televised Iowa Hawkeyes football game.
More than 700 people turned out - and stood for hours in occasional drizzle and frigid temperatures to hear Buttigieg speak from a small stage on Roosevelt High School's front lawn.
""A big football game and lousy weather, and he gets 700 people? Things like that just don't happen,"" said Matt Paul, a local Democratic strategist who ran Hillary Clinton's 2016 Iowa campaign. ""Something is clearly going on.""
What is going on is Buttigieg seizing an opening in the Democratic presidential field, pushing his way into the gap between liberal Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and the more moderate former vice president Joe Biden.
""The way we think this shapes up is, if you want the most ideological, far-out candidate possible, you've got your answer. You want the most Washington candidate possible, you've got your answer,"" Buttigieg said Saturday from his campaign bus in Iowa. ""Everybody else, I think, can come our way. I think that's almost everybody.""
That positioning represents a significant shift from Buttigieg's posture when he entered the race. Buttigieg made early headlines by portraying himself as the vanguard of generational change, a 37-year-old seeking to become the first openly gay president and talking up big liberal ideas, like abolishing the electoral college and restructuring the Supreme Court. While his campaign says he still supports those policies, he rarely mentions them on the campaign trail these days.

Since late summer, he's cast himself as a Midwestern pragmatist who offers ""real solutions, not more polarization,"" a slogan that dings both the less-defined Biden approach and the plan-heavy Warren strategy. More recently, he's sharpened his criticisms against the ascending Warren on Medicare-for-all, the single-payer health-care plan advocated by her and Sanders, running statewide ads arguing that the proposals would take away choice for Americans.
Iowa is critical to Buttigieg's campaign. While he has moved up in polling in the first voting state, below Warren but competitive with Biden and Sanders, he has not yet seen as significant a shift in national polling. He remains far less known outside the early states than the race's front-runners.
His campaign hopes that a strong showing in the caucuses in February could vault him into the top tier across a wider range of states, particularly those not dominated by the white and educated voters who now represent his strongest supporters.
Buttigieg is not the only candidate seeking the same positioning but so far is the most successful. Former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke once was seen as a contender for the space between Warren and Biden; he departed the race on Friday. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) also has competed there, but has yet to develop either polling momentum or the vast fundraising network that Buttigieg has assembled to finance his effort. Last week, she contracted her campaign and is now focused solely on Iowa, hoping for the same momentum he's counting on.

Buttigieg has an advantage, however, having quickly put together one of the largest campaign operations on the ground, with more than 110 staffers and 21 offices, on par with Warren and Biden. He is spending heavily on television advertising in the state - financed by the more than $51 million he's raised so far this year.
""We need to do well in Iowa,"" he emphasized Saturday on his second Iowa bus tour, which stopped in several cities in northern Iowa, mostly in counties that went for Trump in 2016.

With the Feb. 3 caucuses less than 100 days away, Democrats unaffiliated with Buttigieg's campaign say they have recently seen growing interest in the Indiana mayor as Iowans anxious to defeat President Trump consider the issue of electability. Among those taking another look: Voters who believe Warren is too liberal to win the general election but worry about the candidacy of Biden, whose campaign has been hamstrung by questions about his family's ethics and his less-than-stellar fundraising.
""I'm hearing from a lot of people that they like what Elizabeth Warren is saying, but they worry she may turn off voters who are moderates and Republicans,"" said Steve Drahozal, chairman of the Democratic Party in Dubuque County, a traditionally blue area in northeastern Iowa that narrowly flipped to Trump in 2016.
More than 800 people recently turned out to hear Buttigieg speak there along the Mississippi River, one of the largest rallies in the area so far this year. While Biden remains loved and respected, Drahozal said, Buttigieg is viewed by some Democrats there as a ""more palatable candidate"" who could win over liberal voters without scaring moderates. 
He has all but declared that himself in recent days.
""I'm not about being in the so-called right place ideologically, whatever that means. I'm about having answers that are going to make sense,"" Buttigieg said Saturday. ""I think [Biden] and I share some things for sure, but also what I'm offering is very different. What I'm offering is the idea that there's no going back to normal, there's no business as usual.""
As he attempts to elbow his way into the field's top ranks, Buttigieg has occasionally gone overboard. In an interview with Showtime's ""The Circus,"" Buttigieg said he thought the primary was shaping up to be a ""two-way"" race between him and Warren. He quickly walked back those comments - ""I don't think that came out right,"" he said - even as he has continued to train his attacks on the senator from Massachusetts.

When he entered the presidential race last spring, Buttigieg was a barely known Midwestern mayor with a hard-to-pronounce last name whose most substantial national exposure had been during his failed 2017 bid to become chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He has sought since to draw implicit comparisons between the last Democrat with an unusual name, seeking to be the first black president, and himself, seeking history as the first gay one.
In place of Barack Obama's ""Change we can believe in,"" Buttigieg has threaded the needle on the campaign trail, promoting policies he says are realistic while also casting them as ""bold enough to solve the problems in front of us."" He asks voters to visualize what the end of a Trump presidency would look like - and just how difficult it will be to pass new legislation.
""I'm asking you to really think about what it's going to be like that day,"" Buttigieg told the crowd in Decorah. ""We're going to be even more divided than we are today. . . . Think about how exhausted from fighting that this country's going to be.""
That, too, dovetails with his newer criticism of Warren as being too pugilistic. In television interviews and at the last debate, he attacked Warren for supporting a ""my way or the highway"" approach to health care. (He favors maintaining the private insurance market but allowing Americans to buy into Medicare if they wish.) 
He initially criticized Warren for not having a plan to pay for Medicare-for-all. After she released a proposal last week, Buttigieg called the math ""controversial."" More broadly, he has accused Warren of inviting ""infinite partisan combat"" with her proposals of sweeping structural change.
Warren's allies are closely watching Buttigieg but hope that her funding proposal will effectively quiet his criticism that she hasn't been straightforward about how she'd pay for her plan.
""There's very little fear that he's going to win the nomination. But he seems very happy to do a ton of damage in the meantime,"" said Adam Jentleson, who was a top aide to former Senate Democratic leader Harry M. Reid (Nev.) and is close to Warren's campaign. 
""There's the difference between attacks from the left and attacks from the right. And attacks from the right validate Republican attacks that will come in the general election. So anytime you attack someone from the right in the Democratic primary, you're giving fodder to Republicans in the general.""

In Iowa, where Buttigieg has campaigned as a nice-guy candidate unwilling to engage in intraparty squabbling, his sharper elbows have prompted mixed reactions. His back-and-forth with Warren and others thrilled supporters who had been anxious to see Buttigieg do something to stand out in the historically large field of candidates. 
""What we saw was a much more passionate, expressive Pete than we've seen in the past,"" said Terri Hale, a longtime Democratic Party activist from Des Moines who endorsed Buttigieg over the summer and who, along with her husband, has been privately encouraging the mayor to show more fire in his candidacy. ""We agree with his positions, with his values, but we've argued that he needs to be more expressive . . . to show more personality."" 
But other Democrats wondered whether that might turn off those who have gravitated toward Buttigieg because of his earlier, more positive message. In southeastern Iowa's Wapello County, which flipped to Trump in 2016, Democratic chair Zach Simonsen said he was at a recent house party hosted by the Buttigieg campaign at which people went around the room listing the biggest reason they were interested in the mayor.
Many praised Buttigieg's focus on his faith, but most said they liked that he came across as a nice guy. ""A lot of people said they admired how he stayed above the fray and the negativity in the first few debates,"" Simonsen said. He wondered how Buttigieg's ""more aggressive and negative"" tone would ultimately play with people in his county.
Buttigieg and his campaign are sensitive to the idea that he's gone on the attack - arguing that he's accentuating policy differences in a way that's ""factual and respectful,"" as an aide put it. But Grant Woodard, a Des Moines lawyer and former Democratic strategist, said it can be a tricky balance for a candidate, particularly in Iowa, where voters tend to be more sensitive about negativity. He recalled the 2004 caucuses, when John F. Kerry benefited from spats between two other candidates, former Vermont governor Howard Dean and Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri.
""It's a different ballgame here through caucus as opposed to the general,"" Woodard said. ""You've got to be careful in terms of criticism and negative campaigning because it could blow up in your face. You can ask Howard Dean and Dick Gephardt about that.""

 Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) unveiled a broad plan Monday that calls for spending hundreds of billions of dollars to improve public schools from prekindergarten through 12th grade. She wants America's wealthiest people to pay for it.
Her plan also would eliminate use of test scores for ""high-stakes decisions"" and end federal funding for new charter schools.
Warren, who in some recent polls has topped the other candidates running for the Democratic presidential nomination, would steer education policy away from that of President Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who have said their priority is expanding alternatives to traditional public schools.
""To keep our traditional public school systems strong, we must resist efforts to divert public funds out of traditional public schools,"" Warren said in the plan. She pointed to charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately operated (and which Warren once supported), and to DeVos-backed voucher and tuition tax-credit programs that use public money for private and religious school education.
""We should fight back against the privatization, corporatization and profiteering in our nation's schools,"" she said in her plan, which was applauded by the leaders of the two major teachers unions.
Warren, who has touted dozens of plans for the country, said she would pay for her education vision with a proposed ""wealth tax."" It would levy a 2 percent tax on wealth above $50 million and a 3 percent tax on wealth above $1 billion. Some economists and other Democratic candidates have said the tax would not raise as much as Warren says it would and could not pay for everything she plans.
A representative for the Warren campaign said Sunday that Warren would use the wealth tax to pay for the new education plan as well as for previously announced initiatives to provide universal child care and early- learning opportunities, cancel most student college debt and offer free tuition at public colleges.
And now, the representative said, other plans Warren had intended to use the wealth tax to cover - to end the opioid crisis, create a small-business equity fund and invest in election security and administration - will be funded by closing the ""stepped-up basis"" loophole on the tax on inherited assets. Warren says that move will raise more than $100 billion over 10 years.
It is unclear whether her funding proposals will cover the more than $1 trillion in initiatives that Warren has advanced for pre-K through college. But Warren has staked out a vision for pre-K through 12th grade that is at least as expansive as any other candidate's in the Democratic race.
Warren's plan most resembles that of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has offered what he calls a Thurgood Marshall Plan for Public Education. It includes rethinking the way public schools are funded, giving a major boost in funding to schools in high-poverty areas and freezing all federal money for new charter schools. Former vice president Joe Biden's education plan is less detailed but includes more spending for schools in high-poverty districts.
America's public schools are funded heavily, though not exclusively, through property taxes, with the result being that poorer neighborhoods have less to spend on their schools. Federal money intended to help those school systems doesn't come close to closing the gap. Warren said she wants to change that formula and work toward an equitable funding system as she pours more money into schools in high-poverty neighborhoods.
Warren's plan takes aim at some of the most systemic problems in education, including segregated classrooms and neighborhoods, and low teacher pay. It recognizes that student achievement is affected by factors outside the classroom and calls for changing policies on housing, energy and broadband availability that Warren said affect the ability of students to get a high-quality education.
The plan would:

l
Quadruple federal Title I funding for schools in high-poverty neighborhoods, which would add $450 billion over the next 10 years - and change the way that funding is implemented so that the neediest students benefit.


l Fund the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act at the level the federal government originally promised - 40 percent of the total cost of educating students with disabilities - which would add $20 billion a year in new federal grants and expand IDEA funding to young children.

l End federal investment in charter school expansion, ban for-profit charter schools and ensure existing charter schools are subject to the same transparency and accountability requirements as traditional public school districts. Warren also supports making school districts the only authorizers of charter schools and promises to ""crack down on union-busting and discriminatory enrollment, suspension, and expulsion practices in charter schools.""

l Reinstate Obama-era protections for transgender students under federal law that were revoked by Trump and take other steps to protect LGBTQ students and faculty.

l Invest federal dollars to raise teacher pay and strengthen the bargaining power of teacher unions.

l Eliminate use of standardized test scores for high-stakes decisions. The plan says, ""As president, I'll push to prohibit the use of standardized testing as a primary or significant factor in closing a school, firing a teacher, or making any other high-stakes decisions, and encourage schools to use authentic assessments that allow students to demonstrate learning in multiple ways.""

l Cancel student breakfast and lunch debt and provide free and nutritious school meals.

l Ban the storing and selling of student data.

l Expand social-emotional learning.

l Offer $100 billion in grants to transform 25,000 public schools into community schools, which provide family support and health and social services to students.
The plan won applause from the presidents of the two major teachers unions - Lily Eskelsen García of the National Education Association and Randi Weingarten of the American Federation of Teachers - but neither has endorsed a Democratic candidate.
Supporters of charter schools said Monday they were disappointed with Warren's proposal.
""Elizabeth Warren's unfortunate rejection of the Obama legacy on public charter schools is fundamentally at odds with her party,"" Amy Wilkins, senior vice president of advocacy at the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, said in a statement. ""President Obama increased funding for the federal Charter Schools Program more than any other president, and the majority of rank-and-file Democrats understand this funding is critical to support the education of underserved students.""
Over the years, Warren has changed positions on some education issues. She once supported charter schools but in 2016 opposed an initiative in Massachusetts - funded mostly by Republicans - to lift a cap on the number of charters.
In 2015, she co-sponsored an amendment to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), the successor to the No Child Left Behind law, that explicitly called for the use of standardized test scores to hold schools ""accountable."" Now, she doesn't want test scores to be used to decide whether a school should close.
In a 2003 book, she advocated for a fully funded voucher program that would enable children to attend any public school of their choosing (although not private or religious schools). But her new plan says nothing about it.

Plan would delay making program mandatory; critics see it as retreat
After months of criticism from Democratic leaders and voters, Sen. Elizabeth Warren offered a new approach to her Medicare-for-all proposal Friday, adding an intermediate step that would let Americans participate in an optional government-run health plan before she attempted to pass a mandatory program. 
Under Warren's new plan, which she calls a 'Medicare for All option,' all Americans would be eligible to participate in Medicare, but no one would have to. She would push for this initiative in her first 100 days in the White House, then make a separate effort to pass Medicare-for-all later in her first term.
It's a clear shift for the senator from Massachusetts as she attempts to ward off criticism that her single-payer health plan is unrealistic substantively and toxic politically. Warren for months had signaled a full-throated embrace of Medicare-for-all, and this new approach significantly tempers that urgency.
That may ultimately better position Warren for a contest with President Trump if she is the Democratic nominee. But on Friday it prompted an immediate backlash from her centrist rivals as well as liberal activists.
Kate Bedingfield, deputy campaign manager for former vice president Joe Biden, called Warren's maneuvering 'a full program of flips and twists,' while Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) said she was 'backtracking,' and Lis Smith, spokeswoman for South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, accused her of trying to 'paper over a very serious policy problem.' 
On the left, activists sounded the alarm that Warren's two-step approach could halt momentum for Medicare-for-all, potentially torpedoing that goal. 
'Doing this in stages creates a political danger and an opening for opponents to prevent further progress,' said Adam Gaffney, president of Physicians for a National Health Program. 'The longer the rollout, the more political risk.'
But Warren suggested that her approach was the best of both worlds, providing immediate relief for many Americans without giving up the goal of a universal, government-run program.
'By the end of my first 100 days, we will have opened the door for tens of millions of Americans to get high-quality Medicare for All coverage at little or no cost,' Warren wrote in a Medium post. 'But I won't stop there. Throughout my term, I'll fight for additional health system reforms.'
She said she hopes voters will be able to 'see for themselves' that their experience with Medicare is better than with private insurance, building support for Medicare-for-all.
Experts and rivals portrayed the move as a retreat from one of Warren's highest-profile policy positions on a matter that's of top importance to many voters. Her position arguably now resembles the 'public option' favored by many of her centrist competitors: a proposal that would allow Americans to choose a government-run program if they wanted, rather than the mandatory approach favored by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
'It's much less disruptive,' said Kenneth Thorpe, a health-care expert at Emory University. 'It's in the same spirit as offering a public option.' 
Sanders, accepting an endorsement Friday from the largest nurses union in the country, attacked Warren's approach as a postponement in the fight against a rapacious health-care industry. 'Some people say we should delay that fight for a few more years "" I don't think so,' he said. 'We are ready to take them on right now, and we're going to take them on on Day One.'
Warren's team is particularly sensitive to how Sanders's voters perceive her proposal, since she hopes to pick up their support should he drop out of the race.
'Fundamentally, the question that will prove the wisdom or the failure of the whole calculation is: Is she still close enough' to Sanders?, said one person familiar with the Warren campaign's thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of the campaign. 
'If she's the nominee "" or if people have to decide to rally between one of the two of them "" has she stayed close enough that people think, 'It's not exactly Bernie, but it's pretty darn close'?' 
Medicare-for-all has become a major test for Warren, who has steadily risen in the polls after a rocky start. As her candidacy has gained momentum, she's faced increasing scrutiny over how she'd pay for the program without raising middle-class taxes.
Leaders in her own party have also questioned whether she could withstand attacks in a general election accusing her of eliminating the private health insurance industry and taking insurance away from more than 150-million people. 
Those concerns deepened this month when Warren proposed a $20.5-trillion financing plan for Medicare-for-all, mostly in the form of new taxes. Critics said it would result in a tax hike on the middle class "" something she denied "" while academics said her cost assumptions were far too optimistic. 
Warren's team carefully laid the groundwork for Friday's proposal, reaching out to selected allies, which paid off in some quarters. Ady Barkan, an influential advocate for Medicare-for-all, said the transition plan is 'smart politics and good policy.'
Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who introduced the House version of a Medicare-for-all bill, called it a 'smart approach.' 
Centrist Democrats' angst over Warren's momentum is one reason why former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg is considering entering the presidential race and why former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick recently launched his candidacy.
Patrick, on his first full day campaigning Thursday, contrasted Warren's health-care approach with his. 
'We kept learning as we went, and I think that's what's going to have to happen for any of the big solutions,' he said, recalling how Massachusetts officials expanded health care in the state. 'I want us to have an ambitious agenda. I want that. That is the goal. The means for getting there can vary.' 

Warren's transition proposal is similar to the plan Buttigieg has outlined, which he calls 'Medicare for all who want it.' Under that idea, Medicare would be open to the poor and would provide subsidies to middle-income families.
'This is definitely Warren inching over toward Buttigieg and away from Bernie on health care,' opined Nate Silver, editor in chief of the politics website FiveThirtyEight. 

Warren has provided more details than Buttigieg, saying she would immediately offer free health care to about half the country, including all children and poor families. She would also lower the eligibility age for Medicare to 50 and let young people buy into 'a true Medicare for All option.' 

The person close to Warren's campaign said she had not expected Medicare-for-all to become such a critical issue in the presidential race. In the early spring, all the major Democratic contenders aside from Biden signaled support for it, but a backlash has prompted several candidates to back away.


'It wasn't really clear that we were going to be spending the fall drilling down on the details of her [health-care] plan,' said the person close to Warren. 
'They wanted to make sure they were stapling themselves to Medicare-for-all,' the person said. 'But it wasn't clear that there was going to be much more to it then advocating for Bernie's plan.'

Labour leader trying out-proposals pushed by-Warren, Sanders 


BIRMINGHAM, England "" Jeremy Corbyn recently introduced his Labour Party's manifesto in a little red book, calling it the 'most radical' in generations by promising British voters free child care, tuition-free university and free fast Internet, alongside the nationalization of mail, rail, water and energy.
Corbyn said that if Labour wins Britain's December election, his government will seek to 'transform society,' grinding away the sharp edges from free-market capitalism and rebuilding the United Kingdom from the factory floor to the corporate suite 'for the many, not the few.'
Corbyn's campaign is in many ways a 2019 test-drive of the proposals and thinking being pushed by liberal U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) as they campaign ahead of the Democratic presidential primaries.
Many of Corbyn's plans "" for a million new jobs erecting wind turbines, for home care for the elderly in need, for soaking the rich and Google "" are popular with the public on both sides of the Atlantic. 
But Corbyn is decidedly not.
The 70-year-old European-style socialist, who quotes Franklin D. Roosevelt and used to pedal his bicycle to Parliament, is one of Britain's least popular politicians.
Why?
'People don't think that Jeremy Corbyn has got the chops to do the job as prime minister,' said Steven Fielding, a professor of political history at the University of Nottingham. 'People have images of their leaders, and they just don't see Jeremy Corbyn as the kind of person who can do that job.'
The pro-Tory news media have been mocking Corbyn for years, depicting him in cartoons as a bug-eyed 'red menace' in a Lenin cap. The front page of the tabloid Daily Mail on Friday announced the Labour plans as 'the Marxist Manifesto' and claimed 'Corbyn declares war on marriage, inheritance and business.' 
Corbyn, who is supportive of the Palestinian cause, has also been accused of failing to root out anti-Semitism within his party.
And he has taken a wishy-washy stance on Brexit "" saying he would remain neutral in a hypothetical second referendum "" at a time when voters are seeking leaders with more decisive positions on whether Britain should leave the European Union.
According to pollsters, Corbyn is the most unpopular Labour leader since Michael Foot in the 1980s. Foot resigned after Margaret Thatcher trounced Labour in a landslide victory in 1983.
After almost a decade in power, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party would seem to be due for a defeat. Traditionally, that is the political cycle in Britain, as it is in the United States.
A further factor that should be working in Corbyn's favor: The Tories have, by necessity and design, presided over a decade of austerity "" the kind of belt-tightening budgets that hurt real people, that close libraries and take police off the streets. 

Under the Conservatives, London's financial center has boomed, while the old industrial north of England has withered, with its once-grand Victorian-era 'high streets' now lined with shuttered businesses, alongside betting parlors, charity shops and pubs decorated by dust motes.
So Corbyn's agenda, which, like Warren's, would tilt power toward working people, is highly appealing to many Brits.
Johnson's party, however, is holding steady with a lead of 10 points or more in surveys of election intentions. The mop-headed, bombastic prime minister, with a proven record of stretching the truth, elicits strong opinions: Some love him; many don't. But enough voters seem ready to back him now that he is aiming to stay at 10 Downing Street with a majority government and promising to 'get Brexit done.'
Marcus Roberts, director of international projects at polling firm YouGov, said, 'It's really interesting just how left-wing the appetite for change is, among so many British voters.'
A poll last week, for instance, found that 51-percent of Brits said no one should be a billionaire. 
Surveys suggest that while voters may like Corbyn's agenda, they are concerned about how realistic and affordable the proposals would be, and they suspect it won't just be the rich paying more taxes, but the middle and working classes, too.
There is also, Roberts said, 'a disconnect between the popularity of its policies and the unpopularity of its leader.'
Labour leaders and supporters are anxious about their election prospects. And yet many in the party remain committed to their leader.
'I admire Jeremy Corbyn. He's always stuck to his guns,' said Jean Brant, 69, a nurse in Birmingham who came out to support her party leader. 'I don't know what I'll do if we lose this one.'
Brant acknowledged that the party was vulnerable. 'Oh, they hate Jeremy, they do, the Tories. They say he loves the terrorists! But he's the one who helped bring peace to Northern Ireland. They lie.'
Lewis Quinn, 18, a student studying politics at the University of Birmingham, was going to vote in his first general election. 'Jeremy Corbyn is the real deal,' he said. 'Agree or disagree, he's always on the right side of history.' Quinn said college free of tuition is a brilliant idea.
Corbyn is perhaps an improbable leader of the Labour Party. For years, especially during the era of Tony Blair moderation, the member of Parliament for London's Islington North constituency was outside of Labour's mainstream. 
From the backbenches, Corbyn opposed the Iraq War, criticized NATO and wrote articles for the Morning Star, a socialist newspaper founded by Britain's Communist Party.
By the time Corbyn ran for Labour leader in 2015, 'Blair' had become a dirty word within the hard left of his party "" his image tarnished by the Iraq War "" and the country was tired of the cold austerity dishes served up by the Conservatives.
Many Labour lawmakers opposed Corbyn's leadership, but he benefited from changes to the party voting rules that gave the grass roots greater say.
Under Corbyn, Labour has tacked hard to the left. The party's agenda in the December elections is way more audacious than the one it proposed just two years ago, in the last general election.
His government would jack taxes on the rich, alongside Google, Facebook and Amazon, and punish 'the tax dodgers, bad bosses and big polluters.'
There'd be a million new jobs, Corbyn promised, in his Green Industrial Revolution to combat climate change, real honest physical labor: carpeting Britain with new forests, building electric cars and erecting wind turbines.
In the way that Warren is promising 'big, structural change,' Corbyn's slogan for 2019 is, 'It's Time for Real Change.'
Like the Democratic Party in the United States, Labour has been at war with itself. 
Tom Watson, the more moderate, centrist deputy of the Labour Party who clashed with Corbyn on Brexit and anti-Semitism, announced this month that he would be stepping down.
Ian Austin, a former Labour politician, made the rounds on television this month saying voters should pick Johnson because Corbyn is 'completely unfit to lead our country.' Austin said Labour's struggles with anti-Semitism "" and Corbyn's public acts of solidarity with Hamas and Iran "" led him to leave the party.
In a recent televised debate, Corbyn called anti-Semitism 'an absolute evil and scourge within our society.' 
Labour loyalists hope their party can replicate its trajectory in the 2017 general election, which saw its popular policies boost support for the party and its leader. 
In that contest, Labour was 20-points behind in the polls but surged forward and, with a surprise photo-finish, denied then-Prime Minister Theresa May and her Conservative Party a majority in Parliament.
But there is no evidence, at the moment, of the tide suddenly shifting for Corbyn.
Roberts said: 'With Corbyn not winning the TV debate, not closing the gap on who voters think would be the best prime minister, with him severely trailing Boris Johnson in the favorability stakes, it's easy to see why popular policies from an untrusted, unpopular messenger aren't connecting with voters. . . . There's still time for that to change, but that time is really running out.'

 The fifth Democratic presidential debate of the 2020 campaign, hosted by The Washington Post and MSNBC, had 10 candidates, lasted more than two hours and offered few statements that merited fact-checking. Here are the claims that caught our attention, drawn from a longer online report with my colleagues Salvador Rizzo and Meg Kelly. Our practice is not to award Pinocchios in debate roundups.


'The president had to confess in writing, in court, to illegally diverting charitable contributions that were supposed to go to veterans.'


 "" South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg

This is false.
In a civil complaint filed in June 2018, then-Attorney General Barbara D. Underwood of New York charged that the now-defunct Donald J. Trump Foundation had violated a federal law known as the Johnson Amendment, which bars charities from supporting candidates for office.
Trump's 2016 presidential campaign 'extensively directed and coordinated the Foundation's activities in connection with a nationally televised charity fundraiser for the Foundation in Des Moines, Iowa on January 28, 2016,' Underwood charged.
The fundraiser was billed as an effort to 'raise funds for veterans' organizations,' but the Trump campaign commandeered nearly $2.8-million in donations and 'dictated the manner in which the Foundation would disburse those proceeds, directing the timing, amounts and recipients of the grants.'
The president settled the lawsuit but did not admit liability. A New York state judge on Nov.-7 noted in a court order that 'the Funds did ultimately reach their intended destinations, i.e., charitable organizations supporting veterans.'
As FactCheck.org reported, 'donations totaling $2.825-million were given to 34 veterans organizations between January 2016 and June 2016,' such as AMVETS and the Green Beret Foundation.




'You've got 500,000 people sleeping out on the street.'


 "" Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)

The way Sanders frames this is exaggerated. His number came from a single-night survey done by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to measure the number of homeless people. On a single night in January 2018, the estimate was that 553,000 people were homeless.
But the report also says that two-thirds "" nearly 360,000 "" were in emergency shelters or transitional housing programs; the other 195,000 were 'unsheltered' "" i.e., on the street, as Sanders put it. The number has been trending down over the past decade. It was 650,000 in 2007.


'I have proposed a two-cent wealth tax. That is a tax for everybody who has more than $50-billion in assets. Your first $50-billion is free and clear, but your 50-billionth and first dollar, you've got to pitch in two cents. And when you hit a billion dollars, you've got to pitch in a few pennies more.' 


"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.)


Warren's 'Ultra-Millionaire Tax' would apply to households with a net worth of $50-million or more, essentially the wealthiest 75,000 households. (She misspoke when she said $50-billion.) They would be charged 2-percent of every dollar of net worth above $50-million.
Households with $1-billion or more in assets would start paying 3-percent on assets above $1-billion. At least that was in Warren's first iteration of her tax plans. She said this tax would raise $2.75-trillion over 10-years. But to help fund her plan for universal health care, she recently announced that she would charge another 3-percent to billionaires, for a total of 6-percent.
'By asking billionaires to pitch in 6-cents on each dollar of net worth above $1-billion, we can raise an additional $1-trillion in revenue,' Warren said in explaining how she would fill the $20.5-trillion hole created by her Medicare-for-all proposal. While 6-percent a year may not seem like much, it would add up to more than 50-percent over 10-years for billionaires.




'I have led the way on voting, and I can tell you right now, one solution that would make a huge difference in this state would be allow every kid in the country to register to vote when they turn 18. If we had a system like this and we did something about gerrymandering and we stopped the voting purges and we did something significant about making sure we don't have money in politics from the outside, Stacey Abrams would be governor of the state right now.' 


"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.)


'It was voter suppression right here in Georgia targeting African Americans that prevented governor Stacey Abrams from being in office right now.'


"" Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.)


Many Democrats claim Abrams lost the Georgia governor's race because of racially motivated voter suppression. Republicans counter that there's no evidence for that assertion and that their candidate won fair and square. In a previous fact check, we talked to experts and took a close look at the data.
Brian Kemp, Abrams's Republican opponent who is now governor, was basically in charge of running his own election because he was Georgia's secretary of state at the time and declined to recuse himself.
Kemp oversaw an aggressive effort to purge voters, with nearly 700,000, or 10-percent, removed from the rolls in the year before the election. 'For an estimated 107,000 of those people, their removal from the voter rolls was triggered not because they moved or died or went to prison, but rather because they had decided not to vote in prior elections,' according to a report by American Public Media.
But there's a counterargument, too. Even if every provisional ballot not counted and every rejected absentee ballot had been awarded to Abrams, it would not have overcome Abrams's 55,000-vote deficit. The 2018 turnout was far greater than any previous midterm, according to FiveThirtyEight, and more African Americans voted in 2018 than in 2016.
Where you land depends on how you view the wide range of pertinent evidence. Klobuchar suggested her statement was a factual claim, not in dispute, though it's really more of an opinion.




'With more African Americans under criminal supervision in America than all the slaves since 1850, do not roll up into communities and not talk directly to issues that are going to relate to the liber
ation of children.'


"" Booker 

There are several problems with this claim. First, as Booker framed it, it's simply wrong. The 1850 Census counted 3.6-million slaves. African Americans made up 2.3-million, or 34-percent, of the total 6.8-million correctional population in 2014.
A Booker spokeswoman sent us a link as evidence to a 2014 PolitiFact fact check about a different claim "" that more black men are now in prison than there were enslaved African American men in 1850. 'There were about 1.68-million African American men under state and federal criminal justice supervision in 2013, 807,076 more than the number of African American men who were enslaved in 1850,' the fact check said, rating it 'true.'
But that's not what Booker said.
Moreover, even if the black men comparison is correct in terms of raw numbers, it's still misleading because the U.S. population has soared since 1850, as our colleagues at Wonkblog noted in 2015. The census that year found that roughly 9 in 10 of the nation's 3.6-million black people were enslaved. By contrast, 1 in 11 black people is under correctional supervision today, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.




'There are only two countries in the world that don't have paid family leave for new moms: the United States of America and Papua New Guinea. That is the entire list, and we need to get off this list as soon as possible.' 


"" Businessman Andrew Yang

It may seem like a surprising statistic, but Yang is correct, according to a March report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Paid maternity leave is also guaranteed in every country except Papua New Guinea and the United States, the report said. An International Labor Organization report also reached the same conclusion. At least one other report also listed Lesotho, Liberia and Swaziland as countries that do not provide paid family leave.

After fourth debate, Democrats target agenda to stunt her momentum

COLUMBUS, Ohio - Sen. Elizabeth Warren confronted a cascade of pointed criticism from a trio of more moderate Democratic rivals Wednesday, as they sought to capitalize on a debate that saw the leading liberal candidate face intense scrutiny amid worry by her opponents that her momentum, money and energetic crowds are obscuring a hard look at her ideology. 
Joe Biden lobbed some of his most biting charges at her, questioning her honesty and saying her Medicare-for-all health plan ""is ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous."" South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) stepped forward more assertively against Warren in the wake of persistent questions about Biden's own strength as the more moderate standard-bearer.
""Last night she was more specific and forthcoming about the number of selfies she's taken than about how her plan is going to be funded,"" Buttigieg said on CNN. 
""Show your math and say how you're going to pay for Medicare-for-all,"" Klobuchar said in a separate interview. 
As the party's fourth debate concluded, the Democratic primary contest opened a more robust and unpredictable clash over the ideological direction of the party, with moderates attempting to ignite the kind of passion that the liberal candidates have harnessed with large crowds and grass-roots donor networks. After months in which the race was largely static amid a crowded, free-ranging field, the nomination fight is showing signs of narrowing its focus to fewer candidates, divided into parallel feuds in the liberal and moderate wings of the party.
Warren (Mass.) is entering a crucial phase of her campaign, taking attacks from all sides for the first time since she ascended in popularity, and attempting to demonstrate she can withstand the kind of scrutiny that previously fell mostly on Biden, who until recently held an unchallenged lead in the polls. Yet as she attempts to coalesce support on the party's left flank, Warren faces a renewed challenge from liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), whose debate appearance helped alleviate questions about his health and whose new endorsements and deep bank account have made clear he has no intention of leaving the race.
The left's feud is replicated in the center, where Biden faces challenges from Buttigieg, Klobuchar and others. 
""It's the first time the candidates admitted that Warren is the front-runner. Nobody had onstage, next to her, pressure-tested her policies and statements before,"" Ben LaBolt, the national press secretary for President Barack Obama's 2012 campaign, said of the debate. ""Biden has always been a fragile front-runner, and I don't think you would call him the front-runner anymore. So if you are Buttigieg or Klobuchar, the most obvious play was to try to go after Biden supporters who seem more gettable now than they were six months ago.""
Biden on Wednesday also faced a striking problem for a former vice president with decades of Democratic connections: a lack of money. He only had $9 million cash on hand at the end of the third quarter, figures released late Tuesday showed. That was less than a third of the stockpile enjoyed by Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg, and the gap elevated fears of allies about his ability to compete if a contentious primary fight runs deep into next spring.
Biden on Wednesday dismissed concerns about his financing, and he pointed toward the advantage Warren and Sanders had in transferring money from their Senate accounts. He gave no hint to any cutbacks in spending, which included nearly $1 million for private charter flights in the third quarter. (Warren on Wednesday was spotted flying in coach on a commercial airline.)
The former vice president sought to focus instead on the lively squabble over Warren's liberal policies, particularly on health care, where she has largely yielded to Sanders. As he and others did during the debate, Biden questioned how she would pay for Medicare-for-all's significant costs.
 Sanders, the author of the Medicare-for-all plan, has acknowledged it will require increased taxes. Warren supports his plan to extend coverage to everyone in the United States and abolish the private health insurance industry, but unlike Sanders she has yet to provide details about how she would pay for a bill estimated to cost $30 trillion over a decade.
Both assert that middle-class Americans would see lower costs overall. But economists have said it is impossible to make that guarantee given the details the candidates have put forward so far.
""It's fascinating that the person with a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential issue in this election in the minds of the American people, across the board,"" Biden told reporters here before heading into a union hall in Columbus. ""And you know, credibility matters. . . . She's going to have to tell the truth or the question will be raised about whether or not she's going to be candid and honest with the American people.""
""I don't want to pick on Elizabeth Warren,"" he added. ""But this is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.""
Biden and his allies also ramped up their criticism of an answer Warren gave during the debate in which she said, ""I think we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East."" She later clarified that she meant only combat troops.
""I was surprised last night in the debate one of my colleagues said we should remove all troops from the Middle East,"" Biden said at a Wednesday afternoon event in Davenport, Iowa. ""We can be strong and smart at the same time.""
Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), who has endorsed Biden, said after the debate that Warren's comment showed Biden was ""clearly the stronger candidate in terms of being able to be commander in chief. She's really not prepared for that role.""
On Wednesday, Warren's chief campaign strategist, Joe Rospars, said the debate had illuminated Warren's rise.
""Last night, in the face of more attacks from more candidates than anyone's taken on any debate stage so far, Warren fought back by making her case for what really matters without descending into petty sniping,"" Rospars tweeted. ""It's a pretty rare thing to see in politics.""
He also pointed to filings released Tuesday that showed Warren had $25.7 million on hand at the end of September: ""She's talked one-on-one with more than 70,000 people and isn't funding her campaign by charging $1,000 to schmooze and take photos with rich people behind closed doors.""
While Biden was aiming directly at a candidate who has met and sometimes exceeded him in recent polls, the strategy for Butigieg and Klobuchar was somewhat more nuanced: to try to persuade voters who may be leaning toward Biden that they are better positioned to articulate a path forward for the party, first against the liberal candidates, and then against Trump. 
Klobuchar on Wednesday remained focused on Warren and her health care plan.
""It's incredibly expensive. And it cuts 149 million people off their current health insurance in four years,"" Klobuchar said in a CNN interview Wednesday, reprising her comments from the night before. ""She just needs to come out and say how she's going to pay for it. That's all. That's what I'm saying. And we're waiting to see it.""
Klobuchar also took issue with Warren's tone. 
""She has repeatedly said . . . things like, 'You have to show you're going to fight for things,' and implying very clearly that those of us who have different approaches aren't fighting,"" she said. ""I'm fighting. I just think I have a better way.""
Although Klobuchar is far behind many of the other candidates in the polls and fundraising, her hope lies in surveys that show most voters haven't yet made up their minds and are willing to continue considering candidates.
The senator from Minnesota pitches herself as pragmatic and realistic; someone who, like Biden, can connect with white blue-collar voters, especially those in the Midwest. She has been campaigning heavily in Iowa and recently did a ""Blue Wall Tour"" of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin - states that voted for Trump in 2016 after having sided with Democratic nominees for decades. 
For his part, Buttigieg has grown more direct in his criticism of Warren over the past several weeks as he too focuses tightly on Iowa, a state that has catapulted past candidates to the nomination, most recently Obama. He has remained in the middle of the pack, lacking the opening that Biden's stumbles could provide. 
Both Buttigieg and Klobuchar claim to represent a sensible Midwestern approach, but from a younger generation than Biden's.
""Right now you have a group of candidates who are positioned to capitalize if one of the front-runners falters in the early states,"" said Jefrey Pollock, a Democratic consultant and pollster who runs Global Strategy Group and previously served as an adviser to the presidential campaign of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.).
""An upset in Iowa or in New Hampshire or Nevada could reasonably open up a lane for someone new,"" he added, pointing toward Buttigieg as well as Sens. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.). ""All will be looking to be the alternative in the reasonable common-sense candidate lane.""
The focus on Warren defused for now a continuing issue for Biden beyond his relative lack of money and supporter passion - the impact of questions about his son Hunter Biden's decision to join the board of a Ukrainian gas company while Joe Biden served as the Obama administration's point man in the country. Trump's effort to prompt investigations of the Bidens is at the heart of the House impeachment inquiry. 
Joe Biden said he wouldn't have changed anything about his actions, including discouraging his son from joining the board, and had no regrets. 
""No. No, I don't,"" he said Wednesday. ""Because I never discussed with my son anything having to do with what was going on in Ukraine. That's a fact.""
Sanders, meanwhile, enjoyed a positive jolt from the debate, his first formal appearance since having a heart attack two weeks ago. After the debate, two prominent congresswomen - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) - endorsed Sanders, giving him another boost.

LONDON "" The day after a historically decisive election in Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson vowed to unify a divided country, while leaders of the opposition Labour Party fought over the reasons for their crushing loss.
On Friday morning, Johnson had an 'audience' with Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace, where, in keeping with tradition, he asked for her permission to form a government. In the final tally, his party won 365 out of 650 seats in the House of Commons.
'Let the healing begin,' Johnson urged to a society that has been at war with itself since a narrowly decided Brexit referendum more than three years ago. 
He vowed to use his party's commanding parliamentary majority "" the largest the Conservatives have enjoyed since the times of Margaret Thatcher "" to make Brexit happen but also 'to unite and level up.'

Unity may prove an elusive mission, especially since Scottish voters flocked to a nationalist and pro-Europe party that immediately threatened to pursue a second independence referendum.
Even if many Brits were exhausted by the Brexit debate, polls suggest they are as divided as ever on their country's relationship with the European Union.
The prime minister said, essentially, that resistance is futile and that Britons who hoped to remain in the E.U. must move on.
Punching the air, in a rumpled suit and with his blond mop of hair askew, Johnson proclaimed: 'Getting Brexit done is now the irrefutable, irresistible, unarguable decision of the British people.' 
'With this election, I think we've now put an end to all those miserable threats of a second referendum,' he said.
Later in the day, he addressed those partial to the E.U. in gentler terms.
'We in this one-nation Conservative government will never ignore your good and positive feelings of warmth and sympathy towards the other nations of Europe,' Johnson said while speaking outside Downing Street. 'Because now is the moment "" precisely as we leave the E.U. "" to let those natural feelings find renewed expression in building a new partnership, which is one of the great projects for next year.' 
Johnson wants to get Britain out of the E.U. by the end of next month and to have a new trade deal with Europe in place by the end of an 11-month transition period. Now that he has a parliamentary majority, that first part should be relatively easy. The second part remains hard.
A lingering question was how much Johnson would pivot away from the austerity politics imposed after the financial crisis by previous Conservative governments to embrace a kind of Tory nanny state. 
He made big spending promises in the campaign: spending on nurses, hospitals, schools and police. On Friday, he told traditional Labour voters who supported the Conservatives for the first time that he would work to prove they made the right choice.
As significant as Johnson's victory was the defeat for the Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn and his self-described radical socialist agenda.
Labour on Thursday had its worst electoral showing since World War II.
Conservatives won big by taking a battering ram to Labour's 'red wall,' the line of fading industrial towns in England's north and Midlands, where the working classes have traditionally backed Labour since World War I.
On Friday, Corbyn announced that he would not lead the party in any future general elections, though he hoped to stay on as leader during a period of 'reflection.'

When Corbyn became party leader in 2015, his supporters believed his left-wing populism was the answer to the rise of the populist far right. Liberal politicians beyond Britain "" U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) among them "" were urged to take heart from the way he succeeded in shifting his party left.
Hours before the polls closed in Britain on Thursday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) sought to rally support for Labour.
'The hoarding of wealth by the few is coming at the cost of peoples' lives,' she tweeted. 'The only way we change is with a massive surge of new voters at the polls. UK, Vote!'
But on Friday, the vote result was seen in some quarters as a potential warning light about the viability of left-wing platforms in Europe "" and maybe in the United States ahead of a presidential election.
'The lessons are ones you'd expect to draw: It's really easy to appeal to your base "" bases are really easy to speak to because they are there,' said Simon Usherwood, a politics professor at the University of Surrey.
What's hard, Usherwood said, 'is reaching out to people in the center, the swing voters,' which is important in countries like the United States and Britain, both of which have two dominant parties. 'If you don't reach out and try and take people off the other lot, you're not going to get anywhere.'
The arguments that raged within Labour on Friday mirrored arguments that have divided left-wing parties across the Western world, though Brexit complicated matters.
Corbyn and others blamed the party's losses primarily on the dominance of Brexit.
'Brexit has polarized and divided debate within this country,' Corbyn said Friday morning. 'It has overridden so much of a normal political debate.'
While Johnson led the crusade for Brexit, Corbyn took a noncommittal stance, giving lukewarm support to the idea of a second referendum and saying he would remain neutral in that vote.
Ian Lavery, the Labour chairman, blamed the party's poor showing on the promise of a second referendum. 'Ignore democracy and, to be quite honest, the consequences will come back and bite you,' he told the BBC.
Others pointed the finger at Corbyn, a leader who is highly unpopular with the British public and who struggled to address allegations of anti-Semitism within his faction.
'Corbyn was a disaster on the doorstep,' senior Labour politician Alan Johnson said in an apoplectic exchange on television with a Corbyn acolyte. 'Everyone knew that he couldn't lead the working class out of a paper bag.'
At times, Corbyn's supporters seemed to be campaigning more against centrists than they were against Johnson and the Conservatives. 
Labour, with the support of activists in the far-left Momentum movement, purged the party of centrists, whom they branded as revanchist disciples of former Labour prime minister Tony Blair. Blair is loathed by many Labour activists today, largely for his support of the Iraq War and his 'third-way' neoliberal economic policies that echoed those of President Bill Clinton. But Blair was also the most electorally successful, longest-serving Labour prime minister of the postwar years.
Labour's debate about purity vs. pragmatism is one that should be familiar to the American left.
But even beyond Brexit, there are reasons to be cautious about extrapolating to an American context.
What counts as liberal in the United States would hardly qualify as such in Britain, a creator of the postwar welfare state. By British standards, figures like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), seen as liberal in the United States, are more in line with traditional mainstream Labour figures, at least in terms of their policy proposals. 
But Britain, much like the United States, has also traditionally shied away from left-wing leaders with policies as far to the left as Corbyn's. Even in the 1960s and 1970s, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson was relatively moderate by the standards of the time, as was James Callaghan after him. 
Labour has traditionally been strong on defense, anti-Communist and relatively low on ideology. A Corbyn victory would have represented a radical departure.

ATLANTA "" The top 10 Democratic candidates for president united around two ideas in a mostly civil two-hour debate Wednesday: President Trump must be defeated at the ballot box and they are each best positioned to do it. 
Ideological divides remain, and policy differences persist. But they no longer serve as ends in themselves, as the real topic of debate has begun to shift with just 75 days before the Iowa caucuses.
 The candidates in Atlanta focused instead on the unabated fear of Trump's reelection, amid recent polling showing the president continues to have an edge in key Midwestern battleground states despite ongoing impeachment hearings.
'You have to ask yourself up here, who is most likely to be able to win the nomination in the first place, to win the presidency in the first place?' Biden asked at the outset of the debate. 'You have to win the presidency in the first place.'
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) promoted her plan for a wealth tax as one of the 'things that unite us.' Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who opposes such a tax, argued that the focus on taxation and not wealth creation would turn off voters. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg defended his lack of experience by citing his roots in the Midwest rather than in Washington. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) boasted that he had received more campaign contributions 'than any candidate at this point in an election in American history.'
'I would argue we need something very different right now,' Buttigieg said. 'In order to defeat this president, we need somebody who can go toe-to-toe, who actually comes from the kinds of communities that he's been appealing to.'

Even attacks on other candidates came in the context of electability. Months after taking a blistering attack from Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) for her prosecutorial record, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) got a chance to respond, and she opted to go after Gabbard's potential in a general election.
'What we need on the stage in November is someone who has the ability to win,' Harris said.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), one of three female candidates still on the debate stage, argued that candidates should not be judged by physical characteristics but by their competency and smarts.
'If you think a woman can't beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day,' Klobuchar said of the House speaker, who has become Trump's chief antagonist. 
The fifth Democratic debate came at an urgent time for many of the candidates who are struggling to stay in the mix. Since the first meeting in June, 22 candidates have appeared on the debate stage, seven of whom have since withdrawn and five more who have struggled to continue their campaigns without the spotlight of a party-sanctioned stage. 
The nomination fight remains wide-open. With additional politicians still taking steps to join the race, and several on stage who might not make the cut for the next debate, nearly two-thirds of voters in New Hampshire and Iowa say they are still open to changing their minds. 
After nearly a year of campaigning, the monthly debates have generally followed a familiar playbook, with the poorer-performing candidates turning on the front-runners and the front-runners struggling to maintain their position.

Wednesday's debate, hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post, was a more tame affair. Direct confrontations of Buttigieg, who has recently emerged as the polling leader in Iowa, were limited to attacks by Klobuchar and Gabbard on his limited experience. Warren escaped the criticism she attracted in October's debate. 
Biden continued to struggle in phrasing his answers, and he stumbled when he inaccurately said he had been endorsed by the 'only' black woman elected to the U.S. Senate. Former senator Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, the first black woman elected to that body, has endorsed him. 
Sanders, meanwhile, renewed his attacks on Biden for his vote to authorize the Iraq War in 2002. Biden challenged businessman Tom Steyer on his past investment in coal-fired power plants. Booker said Biden 'may have been high' when he said recently that he did not want to legalize marijuana, since the position could turn off young and black voters.
But the fireworks of past meetings did not repeat themselves. Harris took a pass when offered a chance to repeat an attack she had leveled against Buttigieg for failing to connect with black voters. Instead, following the dominant strategy, she spoke about her own ability to beat Trump. 
'We have to rebuild the Obama coalition to win,' Harris said. 'I intend to win.'
Up to now, the candidates have pursued a policy contest on two parallel tracks. Liberal firebrands like Warren and Sanders, who are eager for a progressive populist uprising, have argued for big ideas with costs in the trillions that have no clear route for passing in Congress. 
Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar have countered with a return to a more incremental path of progressive change sketched out previously by former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. 
Those trying to paint themselves as bold change agents have had to paper over deep insecurity among Democratic strategists and voters about whether they can defeat Trump. 
The recent Gallup numbers released this week showed only 36 percent of Democrats said they would prefer a candidate who aligns with them on most issues over one more likely to win.
Over the past several months, more-moderate candidates like Buttigieg and Biden have succeeded in turning the debate over Medicare-for-all into a proxy for a debate over electability. 

'The fact is that right now the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare-for-all. It couldn't pass the United States Senate right now with Democrats. It couldn't pass the House,' Biden warned at the debate. 'A hundred and sixty million people like their private insurance.'
While there is broad support for an expanded federal role in health care, the idea of replacing private health insurance is not a popular one, with support of just 37 percent of voters in a January Kaiser Family Foundation poll. 
The 2018 midterm elections demonstrated that Democratic candidates who avoided the policy were more successful in competitive districts, many of them wealthy suburbs, according to an analysis by Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University. 
This concern had led several of the original co-sponsors of Sanders's Medicare-for-all bill to reframe their support.
Harris, who entered the race boasting that she wanted to 'eliminate' the hassles of private health insurance, has similarly pivoted to a plan that would heavily regulate the current industry without getting rid of it altogether. 
Warren has more recently pivoted away from her full embrace of Sanders's approach to Medicare-for-all, which foresees an attempt to start the country on the path to replacing most private health insurance as soon as he becomes president.
Buttigieg has gone through his own metamorphosis, after entering the campaign as an unknown hoping to brand himself as politically fearless. 
He tweeted in 2018 that he favors 'Medicare for All' and 'any measure that would help get all Americans covered.' He made early headlines by embracing structural changes to the U.S. Supreme Court to weaken the conservative majority, and at the July debate he announced that Democrats should stop worrying about Republican attacks on their policies. 
But as he rose into the top tier of candidates, he has pivoted to embrace more-moderate policies, and has gained traction in Iowa with an early advertising campaign that contrasts his plan to offer an optional Medicare program for all Americans.
That fear of alienating the American people and snatching defeat from the potential for victory hung heavy on the debate stage. Trump has yet to be offered a podium at the Democratic debates this year, but he has also never been absent from the proceedings. 
'We cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump, because if we are, you know what, we're going to lose the election,' Sanders said. 
A poll of Wisconsin voters released Wednesday by Marquette University Law School found Trump comfortably beating each of the four highest-polling Democratic candidates in a hypothetical matchup. Trump won the state over Democrat Hillary Clinton by less than a single percentage point in 2016. 
'I want to talk about how we are going to win in 2020,' Steyer said at one point. No one on stage disagreed.

Pence reaches out
to conservative voters
in western part of state

HERSHEY, Pa. "" President Trump returned to Pennsylvania for the fourth time this year on Tuesday, rallying loyal supporters here as part of his campaign's concerted effort to retain control of a state that helped lift him to the White House in 2016 and is likely to be critical to his reelection chances.
Trump's visit came on the same day that House Democrats officially introduced articles of impeachment against him, and the president struck a fiery note, railing against both the Democrats and the media from the earliest moments of his 65-minute rally.
Calling the articles of impeachment 'flimsy, pathetic, ridiculous,' Trump dismissed the inquiry against him as the 'impeachment crap,' and said that any Democrat who votes for it would be sacrificing not just their House majority but their dignity.
'Everybody said, 'This is impeachment lite. This is the lightest impeachment in the history of the country, by far,'' Trump said. 'It's not even an impeachment.'
He added, later: 'They're impeaching me because they want to win an election and that's the only way they can do it.' 
Trump rallied at the Giant Center, a 12,500-seat arena best known for hosting concerts and minor league hockey. He visited here in the closing days of the 2016 bid and during his 'thank you' tour in December 2016 after he won the election.
Hershey is home to the Hershey Co., which still produces chocolate candy and other sweets in the city.
The region, which is dotted with former mill towns and conservative congressional districts, was central to Trump's 2016 victory in Pennsylvania, with surging turnout in this area and others lifting Trump's statewide total even as Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won in Philadelphia and its suburbs.
In the closing days of that race, a wave of navy blue Trump campaign signs popped up across western and central Pennsylvania, foreshadowing Trump's stunning and narrow win in the presidential battleground, where he won by just 44,000 votes in a state where more than 6-million votes were cast. It was the first time since 1988 that a Republican presidential nominee captured Pennsylvania.
'I tried to sound the alarm and no one listened to me. I sensed that first time Trump voters were popping up everywhere,' former Democratic Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell said. 'It's going to be a battle again because he has kept much of that base. The question is: Are they going to stay with him?'
Democrats made significant gains in Pennsylvania in 2018 and in local elections this fall, particularly in Philadelphia's suburbs, where they won control of the Delaware County Council for the first time.
Former senator Rick Santorum, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said that the flurry of victories was 'a continuation of [a] trend in the Philadelphia suburbs' that could make it harder for Trump to win the state next year.
'In the west, Republicans are feeling good. In the central part of the state, they feel pretty good. And in the east, they're waiting to see who the Democratic presidential nominee is going to be,' he said.
Trump so far is seeking a repeat performance and using a similar playbook, with grievance-driven, nationalistic appeals on trade and immigration, flecked with his outrage about the impeachment inquiry.
In Hershey, Trump connected a finalized trade deal announced Tuesday between the United States, Mexico and Canada "" known as the USMCA "" with his impeachment fight, saying the willingness of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to help shepherd the deal was perhaps the lone upside of impeachment.
'They're embarrassed by the impeachment and our poll numbers have gone through the roof because of her stupid impeachment,' Trump said. 'The silver lining of impeachment and this witch hunt "" that's the reason they approved USMCA.'
Vice President Pence is also focusing on Pennsylvania and, in particular, conservative voters in the state, who the campaign is hoping will turn out in high numbers in November.
Earlier Tuesday, Pence traveled throughout western Pennsylvania on a campaign bus, speaking at a Veterans for Trump event near Pittsburgh before heading east toward Hershey.
Pence "" speaking to an older, mostly white audience at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post-128 in Rochester, Pa. "" called the impeachment inquiry a 'disgrace' and said Democrats 'can't run against our record.'
Road trips have become a recent routine for Pence as the 2020 campaign unfolds, highlighting his role as the campaign's frequent point person for engagement with core Republican voters, albeit often visiting smaller media markets than Trump generally commands. He toured on a bus last week around Michigan and courted evangelical Christians at a church, and he has been a ubiquitous promoter of the USMCA.
The trips also help to build Pence's own relationship with Republican voters. 
In a nod Tuesday to Pence's possible political ambitions, one man held a homemade 'Pence 2024' sign at the VFW hall. 
Pence later joined Trump in Hershey, where he introduced the president at the rally.
Trump's campaign and allies are also working to underscore the president's message on the airwaves and on social media.
America First Policies, a pro-Trump nonprofit entity, has been targeting two Pennsylvania Democrats who represent districts that were carried by Trump in 2016: Reps. Matthew Cartwright and Conor Lamb. Ads blasting 'the radical left' and calling on House Democrats to 'end the witch hunt' on impeachment are running.
'It's about jobs, energy issues and the culture. Winning in the west and central part of the state is about connecting on those fronts, with an aging population that appreciates President Trump,' said Ed Rollins, a Republican operative who is co-chair of the pro-Trump Great America super PAC.
But the Trump campaign is also trying to woo suburban women "" a demographic group more skeptical of the president "" and building an outreach program that exists alongside the rallies.
In July, the president's reelection campaign launched the 2020 Women for Trump coalition in Montgomery County, a wealthy Philadelphia suburb that went for Clinton in 2016. The event featured Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump, former White House director of strategic communications Mercedes Schlapp and Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale.
'If we win Pennsylvania by 5,000 votes it might be because every woman in this room walks out and gets four people to vote for us. That could be the difference,' Parscale said at the gathering.
Democrats are similarly motivated. American Bridge, a Democratic group, has poured millions of dollars into an advertising campaign in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, with an emphasis on how some 2016 Trump supporters have come to regret their support for the president three years ago.
'There should be concerns,' said former Pennsylvania congressman Ryan Costello, a moderate Republican. 'Now, if it's [Sens.] Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, suburban Republicans may hold their nose and vote for Trump. But the confrontational way the president behaves, the issues the party is emphasizing in the reddest of states, that's not helping the GOP cause, when you look at how the party talks about gun control or takes a hard edge on immigration.'
Also looming over the Trump campaign's efforts here: former vice president Joe Biden, who was born in Scranton, Pa., and has a rapport with working-class voters. While Biden has struggled in early state polls, he continues to lead national polls of Democratic voters. And Biden has shown strength in Pennsylvania, which, along with Michigan and Wisconsin, is a key contest on the 2020 map.

And indeed, Trump specifically turned his attention to Biden twice during the rally, reprising a long-favored nickname "" 'Sleepy Joe' "" and mocking the former vice president. 
'Have you ever noticed that Biden keeps saying he's in the wrong state?' Trump asked. 'Like if he's in Ohio: 'It's great to be in Iowa tonight.' If he's in Pennsylvania: 'It's wonderful to be in the state of Delaware.''
'What is wrong with this guy, what's wrong with him?' the president continued. 'There's something wrong.'
Rendell, a Biden supporter, however, argued that 'only Biden can probably carry Pennsylvania because he's so familiar to voters that we used to call him the third senator from Pennsylvania.'
Warren was one of several Democratic candidates "" including South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg "" whom Trump singled out Tuesday evening for ridicule. Focusing on Warren, Trump faux-lamented that he had attacked her too early during the Democratic primary cycle as 'Pocahontas' "" a dismissive and offensive nickname referring to what she has claimed is her Native American heritage. 
But for Trump, impeachment proved the most extended riff of the rally, with the president repeatedly returning to what he called an 'ugly' word and warning it was the Democrat's effort to subvert the will of the people. 



'The impeachment hoax is about overturning your great 2016 vote or in the alternative, trying to win the 2020 election,' Trump said. 'That's not going to happen.'

Perhaps the great unknown of 2020 is how the tenor of the Democratic nomination contest will affect the general election. The outcome of the primaries, of course, is far from clear - the nominee may ultimately lean to the center or the left - but what is clear is that the party has shifted in fundamental ways since the last presidential election. You can see it in the policy positions being discussed and embraced by Democrats, many of which go well beyond the positions taken by previous Democratic presidents and nominees - from banning private insurance to free college to a wealth tax to the Green New Deal. You can see it in the left-populist worldviews and solid poll numbers of two of the three leading candidates, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. And you can see it in the substantial popularity among the Democratic rank-and-file of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her allies in Congress. In this issue of the magazine, journalists, wonks, activists and former government officials - from a variety of ideological perspectives - reflect on how all of this might play out in the months and years to come, and how Americans should feel about it. - Richard Just

| Jump to first hitApparently Pete Buttigieg had a bang-up debate performance Tuesday, at least according to many political pundits. Meanwhile, as I was skimming a CNN recap that placed the South Bend, Ind., mayor atop a list of ""winners,"" I was also talking with an old friend who had this to say: 
""Ugh. When did Mayor Pete become that dude who throws you under the bus once you learn only one of you gets the Rotary scholarship?""
Some of his debate performance was inspired, such as his retort to Tulsi Gabbard: ""You take away the honor of our soldiers, you might as well go after their body armor next."" That's a heck of a line. But I've always admired Buttigieg's generally thoughtful, calming manner - and Tuesday wasn't that. ""I don't need lessons from you on courage,"" he scornfully told Beto O'Rourke. His signature move was to sanctimoniously claim he was above all this scrapping, while actively participating in the scrapping.

My sample size is tiny and unscientific, but when I floated this irritation online, the people who agreed were mostly women. Men either hadn't noticed Buttigieg's tonal shift or they liked it: His newfound aggressiveness came across to them as smart debate strategy for a guy who needs to make a fast surge in the polls. 
What to make of suddenly being mildly irritated by Pete Buttigieg, one of the easiest-to-like candidates in the race? It wasn't about him so much as it was about us, the women I was talking to. We'd determined that Buttigieg was behaving like a kind of dude we had seen before, a sort of megalomaniacal Eagle Scout, and weren't sure we entirely loved.
Fair? Not at all.
But politics is often about applying our own life experiences onto candidates, to make them not humans but archetypes. We've seen this most explicitly with female candidates: Is Elizabeth Warren lecturing you? Is Kamala Harris yelling at you? Are they - stop me if this one sounds familiar - shrill? No, and no. And no! But plenty of male voters have watched them on the trail and come away feeling that.
This might be the first election in which , when we talk about electability, we are also talking about the electability of men. Do they have the right kind of masculinity for the moment? Does it seem as if they're addressing the female candidates with respect? What kind of dude are they being?
For every man who saw Hillary Clinton as a shrew, there's a woman who looks deep into Joe Biden's eyes and sees only the father-in-law whose uninvited shoulder rubs end when he either loses his train of thought or decides to reassure you of his wokeness by listing all of his gay friends. 

That dude.
I know one woman who confessed she'd have to really force herself to vote for Bernie Sanders - whose politics she believes in - simply because he reminds he so much of her own estranged father, shaking his index finger over the family dinner table. 
That dude!
Elizabeth Warren is that woman who thinks she knows more than you? Fine. Tom Steyer is that dude who thinks he knows more than you based on once reading the book you wrote.
Kamala Harris is yelling at you? Fine. Have you met Bernie Sanders?
Are any of these stereotypes fair? I don't know. Julián Castro and Cory Booker seemed good to me on Tuesday night, but they drove others up the wall. Cory Booker is the only man in your feminist studies course, bless him, but he sits in the front row and offers his opinion before any women can talk.

I'm slightly embarrassed by the fact that, for me, the most electrifying debate moment wasn't a policy question: It was Harris describing a hypothetical president by casually using the female pronoun: ""The commander in chief of the United States of America has, as one of her greatest priorities and responsibilities, to concern herself with the security of our nation.""
Because if you've never gotten to be the default pronoun - if you've gone through life hearing about firemen and policemen and mailmen, or if you've been told that ""mankind"" just rolls off the tongue better than ""humankind,"" and anyway, ladies, ""mankind"" tacitly encompasses women, too - if you've quietly lived in this world, then it's still shocking to hear about a different world. One in which, sure, the archetypal commander in chief is, by default, a ""her."" 
And not that dude.

The British electorate delivered another surprise Thursday, and the shock waves from the victory for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party are being felt far beyond the United Kingdom. Though the analogies are imperfect, what happened there has implications elsewhere, including the United States as it heads toward the election of 2020.
The vote showed the widening gap between urban and nonurban areas of Britain and the reshaping of the party coalitions "" a pattern that is familiar in the United States in the era of President Trump. The results underscored, in a related way, the disdain many of those nonurban voters have for the elites as well as the power of a nationalist message, something else that has affected American politics.
The rout suffered by the Labour Party and its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, also provided a clear warning of the limits of a left-wing agenda, though Corbyn is more left wing than any of the Democrats running for U.S. president and was saddled with stains of anti-Semitism. Nonetheless, Labour's defeat "" its fourth election loss in a row and its worst performance since 1935 "" could influence the thinking of many Democratic U.S. voters as they pick a nominee next year.
Johnson started off badly, with one of the worst opening acts of any modern British prime minister, losing big votes in Parliament and seemingly stumbling toward disaster and a possible early ouster. But the wily Johnson did what his two Conservative predecessors failed to do and emerged Friday morning with the biggest Tory victory since 1987 and the days of Margaret Thatcher.
His predecessors in 10 Downing Street, David Cameron and Theresa May, both made huge political bets and lost. Cameron called the Brexit referendum in 2016, fully expecting that voters would support remaining in the European Union and hoping that would dampen the long-standing divisions in his party over Europe. When the opposite happened, he stepped down immediately.
Cameron was succeeded by May, whose political skills were no match for the challenge she had been handed by Cameron. As she wrestled with opposition at home to her negotiations with the E.U., she made a fateful decision by calling a snap election in 2017. She hoped the election would add to her narrow parliamentary majority. Instead, the election cost her that majority. She never fully recovered, eventually stepping down because of the impasse over Brexit and her inability to maneuver through.
Johnson made an equally bold bet and won handsomely. Faced with the impasse over the terms of fulfilling the vote to leave the E.U., he, too, called for an election. When Corbyn and Labour finally agreed to that, the die was cast. British voters faced a choice familiar to Americans in 2016, picking between two unpopular leaders of the major parties.
The Tories began the election with a solid lead, but late polls showed the gap between Conservatives and Labour narrowing, which only added to the drama when the exit polls posted as the polls closed showed Johnson's party headed toward a huge victory.
British politics in the Brexit era have become more complex because of the way the issue has scrambled coalitions. There is a traditional left-right division "" Conservatives vs. Labour "" but there is also a Brexit division that has split the coalitions of both major parties. Through the past few years, Brexit did more to bedevil the Conservative Party, which was torn between those strongly in favor of leaving the E.U. even without an agreement and those wary of taking that step.
On Thursday, Brexit bit into the Labour coalition and bit hard. The Labour Party suffered devastation in working-class areas of the country outside of London, areas that had been voting for the party for generations. Among those that went from Labour to Conservative was the mining district once represented in Parliament by Tony Blair, a former prime minister.
These were districts where voters had supported the Brexit referendum, and these voters finally showed their frustrations by giving Johnson a handsome majority and the power now to begin the initial step of taking Britain out of the E.U. and into an uncertain future.
A similar thing has been happening in this country as party coalitions undergo changes. Although Democrats have long claimed to be the party of the white working class, that's hardly the case anymore. For many years, working-class whites have been moving toward the Republican Party, and under Trump that movement has accelerated. That's the conundrum facing Democrats as they think about how to assemble an electoral college majority in 2020.
The exhaustion factor may have contributed to the results in those areas in Britain that abandoned Labour for the Conservative Party. After nearly four years of wrangling over how to exit the E.U., many voters may have decided that only by giving Johnson a freer hand could the country get past this gridlock in Parliament, whatever the consequences.
In the United States, the exhaustion factor could cut differently "" exhaustion caused by the volatility and chaos sewn constantly by Trump. Democrats are hoping that will help motivate voters on the fence to back their nominee and limit Trump's presidency to a single term.
But there could be more to what happened in Britain than simply a fatigue with Brexit. The swings could be related to Brexit, but some party leaders might be refusing to acknowledge reality. The defections also could reflect fears that the Labour Party no longer truly represents the interests of people living in outlying areas of Britain, that the cultural disaffection of those voters "" who have suffered long-term economic decline "" has led to a new voting pattern.
Corbyn is a special case, given his long history and record. But only a few years ago, when Labour did better than expected in the election, he was seen as a possible, if still implausible, prime minister. On Thursday, the roof caved in on him. He said he would not stand for another election as party leader.
Some veterans of Labour politics think the vote reflected Corbyn more than Brexit, sensing that Corbyn and his tight band of supporters repelled voters and cost the party enormously. The Labour Party now faces a period of bloodletting and internal turmoil over the way toward a post-Corbyn party.
That will pit Labour's left against the center, a more virulent strain of the debate already underway in America's Democratic Party. Some people have suggested that Corbyn's defeat is a warning to Democrats that Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) or Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) could deliver the same fate if they become the party's nominee. Neither carries the baggage that Corbyn was carrying, but the British election will add to the pressures on those two candidates to dissuade voters that they would be too risky in facing Trump in a general election.
It cannot be overstated that Brexit is its own case and has paralyzed British politics since the referendum, but there are perils in suggesting it has no relevance to politics elsewhere. The urge to leave the E.U. is in part a reflection of the nationalist strain that exists elsewhere. In the United States, Trump has given it a name: 'America First.' His base has responded to that message, and he is counting on it as a motivating factor in November.
Johnson began this election in better shape than Trump is in as he looks to next year, despite the prime minister's own unpopularity and limitations. Still, Johnson's ability to produce sizable margins in so many of the nonurban districts stands as a possible template for the Trump campaign.
Whether the president has reached the upper limit of turnout in his strongest voting blocs or has more votes to pull is unanswerable today, though his campaign clearly believes there are more to gain. Democrats can't assume that won't happen.
The results in Britain are likely to intensify the debate among Democrats over both the party's agenda and its path to victory. Can Democrats really win back working-class voters, and, if so, how? Or should they bank on returns from the 2018 midterms and subsequent elections that have shown the power of the suburban vote as a foundation of the party's emerging coalition?
Reading too much into what happened Thursday in Britain is risky. But so, too, is dismissing those results as of no relevance to politics here.

Former Mass. governor plans to register today for N.H. primary ballot

Deval Patrick has called party leaders, supporters and elected officials to confirm that he intends to run for the Democratic presidential nomination and that he plans to file his candidacy officially in New Hampshire on Thursday, according to two people with knowledge of his plans. 
Patrick is likely to make the announcement Thursday during an appearance on 'CBS This Morning.' He has been a contributor to the network since September, but CBS announced on Wednesday that it was severing the relationship. After registering for the ballot in New Hampshire, Patrick plans to head to California, a state that falls early in the primary calendar and has a wealth of delegates. The filing deadline in New Hampshire is Friday. 
The former Massachusetts governor on Wednesday was working through a list of people to alert them of his decision, according to those with knowledge of his plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the plans before they are announced. 
Patrick's decision, for which he started laying the groundwork Sunday, could further unsettle the Democratic presidential field less than three months before the contest begins with the Iowa caucuses. He will enter the race just days after former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg began making his own plans to join the field.
The twin decisions come amid lingering concern, particularly among more-moderate Democrats, about the leading 
centrist candidate, former vice president Joe Biden, as well as the rise on the left of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.). Bloomberg had initially decided not to run because he thought Biden would be too formidable an opponent. Patrick spent several months in 2018 considering a bid, but ultimately decided not to run, citing 'the cruelty of our elections process' and its effect on his family. 
Patrick has political strengths and an ability to deliver such soaring oratory that President Barack Obama was accused of taking lines from a 2006 speech of his. He became a two-term governor using an uplifting life story and an aspirational political brand, traits that his allies say could serve him well in a presidential campaign.
Patrick called Biden recently to inform him of his decision, in part because Patrick understands that his candidacy will in some ways be seen as a rejection of Biden, according to a person who spoke recently with Patrick. While Biden has often mentioned his eight-year partnership with 'Barack,' Patrick also shares a long history with the former president, and their political networks have often intertwined. 
It was unclear Wednesday night whether Patrick had spoken with Warren, the U.S. senator from his home state and someone whose political rise he helped in 2012 when he defended her against questions about her claims of Native American heritage. Patrick's entry is already confounding and dividing many Massachusetts Democrats, who will now have two candidates fighting for the nomination. (A third, Rep. Seth Moulton, dropped out of the race earlier in the year.)
But he is likely to face deep scrutiny in the Democratic primary over his corporate ties. He once worked for Texaco and Coca-Cola and served on the board of subprime mortgage lender Ameriquest.
Since leaving office in 2015, he has been a managing director at Bain Capital, the private equity firm that became a target for Democrats in 2012 when Obama was running against Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee who co-founded the company.
A spokesman for Bain did not return several messages asking whether Patrick still remains with the firm. Patrick had been scheduled to speak Wednesday at an investors' conference in Colorado Springs, but he backed out at the last minute. Bain sent another director instead.

One major challenge for Patrick is that he has little time to build the kind of grass-roots campaign operation he prized himself on in Massachusetts. He also may not be able to break through and meet the qualification standards needed to get onto the debate stage. 
'When I was thinking about it many months ago "" one of the questions was: 'How do you break through in a field this large and this talented without being a celebrity or a sensationalist?' ' he said on CBS in June. 'And I'm none of those things.'

The former governor already has missed filing deadlines for Arkansas and Alabama, which could put him at a significant disadvantage if the race goes late and turns into a fight for delegates. 
Patrick will focus his campaign closely on New Hampshire, but there, too, he will need to make a case that he brings something new to an already crowded field. Two senators from neighboring states, Warren and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), will also be on the ballot.
A New Hampshire poll released by Suffolk University in May 2018 found Patrick in the middle of the pack at 4 percent. 
Patrick, who is African American, is aiming to gain ground among black voters in states such as South Carolina, something which has not been achieved by either Democratic Sens. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) or Cory Booker (N.J.), according to polling. The field also has featured current and former governors who have struggled to gain traction and other moderates who have been unable to catch fire. 

One of the reasons Patrick initially decided not to run was the strain it would put on his family. 
'The process is cruel,' he told Boston public radio station WBUR last year. 'Every family has its warts, has its issues . . . has things they'd rather keep private, and we do as well.'
His wife, Diane, was hospitalized for depression after a bruising and racially divisive 2006 gubernatorial campaign. She was also diagnosed last year with Stage 1 uterine cancer but now has a good prognosis. His two daughters, both in their early 30s, were also opposed to the race, but are now said to be more amenable. 
The rigors of a presidential campaign could also reopen a painful chapter involving Patrick's sister. 
Patrick's former brother-in-law, Bernard Sigh, was sentenced in June to more than six years in prison after he was convicted of several charges, including the kidnapping and rape of Patrick's sister.
Patrick in 2014 removed the top two officials at the state's Sex Offender Registry Board in part because they had tried to force his brother-in-law to register as a sex offender for an earlier conviction in California of raping Patrick's sister. The incident became an issue during the final month before Patrick's 2006 election, something he attributed to 'dirty politics.' The disclosure of the matter, he said, 'nearly destroyed their lives.'
He also lacks the financial resources needed for a campaign that will probably stretch into next spring. His campaign advisers have been testing the groundwork for a super PAC as one way to infuse cash into his efforts. But that may also come with political downsides in an environment in which most candidates are building an army of small-dollar donors. 
Patrick has spent the past several days trying to recruit a top campaign staff but has been rebuffed by several potential hires. Several of his longtime advisers "" who earlier had been prepared to join his campaign "" are now working elsewhere. 
John Walsh, who helped Patrick's rise as governor and later served as chairman of the Massachusetts Democratic Party, is running the reelection campaign of Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.). Doug Rubin, who was Patrick's chief of staff and one of his closest advisers, is working for Tom Steyer's presidential campaign. Bakari Sellers, who was helping plot out Patrick's campaign a year ago and has significant South Carolina connections, has since backed Harris.
'If you can get unvarnished, vintage Deval Patrick out there to the world, anyone would be crazy to underestimate what that can do,' said one operative in Massachusetts who has worked with Patrick in the past but is not involved with the campaign. 'But the landscape is tougher when you come in at this point.' 

Rosy Gonzalez Speers, a former Patrick adviser who most recently worked for Andrew Gillum's gubernatorial bid in Florida, has been one of those advising Patrick. They have talked with several potential campaign managers, according to people knowledgeable about those conversations, but so far have not announced who might run the operation.

The Russian military hackers who stole tens of thousands of sensitive Democratic Party documents in 2016 struggled to disseminate their bounty online "" at least until anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks joined the effort, according to a report released Tuesday night.
The report, prepared by analyzing data Facebook provided to the Senate Intelligence Committee, found that the Russian military hackers sought to publicize the documents as early as June-14 that year through a post on Facebook that said, 'Check restricted documents leaked from Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign staff,' and provided a link to an online trove. But despite the potentially explosive contents, the post on the 'DCLeaks' page generated just 11 'likes,' 17 shares and zero comments.
Direct messages to American journalists, made through a fictitious Twitter persona called Guccifer 2.0, generated a spate of news coverage soon after. But that was modest compared to the deluge that came five weeks later, on July-22, when WikiLeaks published the documents and tweeted a link to its 3.2-million followers.
The revelations from the stolen documents, many of which were embarrassing emails showing party officials appearing to favor Clinton over her rival for the presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, soon spread widely enough to prompt the Democratic chairwoman to resign on the eve of the party's national convention.
The hacking campaign's outreach efforts, executed by the Russian military intelligence agency known as the GRU, underscore how marrying stolen documents with sophisticated social media outreach can generate outsize results. It also underscored the unwitting role American journalists played in a Russian intelligence operation to interfere in a U.S. election.
Tuesday's report, called 'Potemkin Pages - Personas: Assessing GRU Online Operations 2014-2019,' is the latest that disinformation researchers have produced using data provided to the Senate Intelligence Committee and gives the most complete account yet of the social media operations of the GRU. It was released by the Stanford Internet Observatory, with research manager Renee DiResta as the lead author. DiResta also has worked as part of the Technical Advisory Group for the Senate committee.
The report found that the GRU, in targeting the United States and other countries, set up phony think tanks and news organizations, created fake online personas and pushed racially divisive online messages through Facebook pages it created, including 'Baltimore is Everywhere' and 'Michael Brown Memorial.' Then-special counsel Robert S. Mueller III indicted 12 GRU officers last year for their alleged role in seeking to disrupt the U.S. election.
 'One thing this report shows is that what happens on social media doesn't stay isolated to social media,' said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. 'Platforms like Facebook can also serve as the launching pad for narratives that spread throughout the information ecosystem. These big platforms need to do a better job of making sure they don't become tools for Russian manipulation of American voters, and responsible actors need to take serious stock of how they interact with, rely on and amplify the information found on those platforms.'
The committee's chairman, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), said: 'This report helps us better understand how the GRU conducts its information warfare operations. It's clear that the foreign influence threat is persistent and evolving, and we cannot flag in our collective effort to combat it.'
Many researchers who have studied Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 presidential race have pointed to the publication of the Democratic Party documents as especially effective at disrupting the election, which Republican Donald Trump narrowly won. Such tactics "" called 'hack and leak' by researchers "" are widely used, highly effective and difficult to combat when used in democratic nations that respect press freedoms.
Mueller's final report, released publicly in April, detailed the relationship between the GRU, operating through the fictitious persona Guccifer 2.0, and WikiLeaks. The anti-secrecy group did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday.
WikiLeaks' founder and longtime public face, Julian Assange, who is in British custody and has been charged by U.S. officials for alleged violations of the Espionage Act, long has denied that the group's source for the Democratic Party documents was Russian military intelligence. (The indictments against Assange are not related to the Democratic Party documents; rather they concern a 2010 leak of U.S. government documents.)
The GRU operations mirrored, to some degree, the influence campaigns waged by the Internet Research Agency (IRA), the St. Petersburg-based operation that was created by an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin but run more as a social media start-up, with civilian employees, than a formal government operation. While the GRU excelled at hacking, it was not nearly as good as the IRA at building an online following and spreading messages.
'We were stunned by what a failure it was,' said DiResta. 'Maybe that's why the IRA exists.'
Facebook said it has removed a number of accounts related to Russian interference in the United States, Syria and Ukraine. 'We welcome independent analysis like the one by the Stanford Internet Observatory that chronicles these campaigns that we investigated and removed in the past,' said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy. 
In addition to the document dump by WikiLeaks ahead of the Democratic National Convention, WikiLeaks in October that year also published thousands of emails stolen from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, sparking several news stories and the spread of lurid and demonstrably false conspiracy theories based loosely on remarks in the emails.
The IRA used its Twitter accounts to help push information from those documents and the ones WikiLeaks published in July, according to previous research by Clemson University professors Darren Linvill and Patrick Warren. They found a dramatic surge of tweets "" 18,000 over a single 24-hour period "" from IRA accounts on Oct.-6, 2016, the day before WikiLeaks published the Podesta emails. The timing suggests some degree of coordination between the GRU and the IRA, perhaps intended to spur online conversation to prepare for the document dump.
Linvill, an associate professor of communication, said there may have been an explicit division of responsibility, with the GRU focused on hacking valuable targets while the IRA mounted a 'guerrilla marketing campaign.'
'That takes sustained effort at persona-building,' he said. 'That's really effective, but it's the kind of thing you are going to want grunts to do . . . It's not really what the GRU is built for.'
The GRU was comparatively successful at what the Stanford report calls 'narrative laundering,' meaning the spreading of disinformation through phony think tanks or news sites, or by using fictitious personas to post content mimicking actual news reports. One well-chronicled fake journalistic persona, sometimes going by 'Alice Donovan,' wrote for a number of sites, including the Inside Syria Media Center, which was a GRU creation as well.
Like the IRA, the GRU also worked across tech platforms. The Inside Syria News Center, for example, operated on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube and had a channel on the encrypted communication service Telegram. Another phony persona, Sophia Mangal, who was listed as an editor for the Inside Syria Media Center, had accounts on Medium, Quora and Twitter.
Despite some successes in these areas, the GRU-created DCLeaks page posted only 22 times over a four-month period before Facebook closed the page. During that time, it had just 834 'engagements' "" a metric counting likes, comments and other reactions from Facebook users "" and did not deploy other promotion tools, such as advertisements.

CONCORD, N.H. "" Michael Bloomberg was not the talk of New Hampshire on Friday.
Robert Pauwels, an undecided independent voter, was waiting for former vice president Joe Biden to appear at a town hall in Franklin that evening. Asked about Bloomberg, he shrugged. 'I don't think he has a chance,' he said.
Others who had turned out to see candidates in the Granite State were similarly unenthusiastic in their reactions to the news that the billionaire and former mayor of New York plans to seek the Democratic presidential nomination. 
A woman in Franklin called the decision 'ridiculous' and said she thought it was prompted by a desire to 'interfere with the process.' In Stratham, a man wearing a badge supporting South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg scoffed. Bloomberg wouldn't draw enough support to become even a spoiler in the nomination battle, he said.
In Concord, Biden offered gracious words for Bloomberg after filing for next year's primary but left no doubt he's ready for the competition: 'Michael's a solid guy and let's see where it goes. I have no problems with him being in the race.' He was quick to add, 'The last polls I looked at, I'm pretty far ahead.'
Buttigieg, in a brief Saturday morning interview before continuing his bus tour of the state, said the voters he's been talking to are in the process of looking at the existing field and trying to narrow it down, albeit they are focused on 'which one of us is best to beat Donald Trump.' As for a hunger for someone new to join the race, Buttigieg said, 'That's not something I've heard from voters.'
All the early reactions might be premature, given the fluidity in the Democratic race. Bloomberg's apparent decision to run for president has for now sharpened the discussion about the qualities of the current candidates and the party's prospects in November 2020.
A Bloomberg entry is seen both as a vote of no confidence in Biden and as evidence that the donor wing of the party, or the moderate wing of the party, or the establishment wing of the party is truly terrified that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has gained the upper hand in the nomination contest.
The unsettled nature of the Democratic nomination campaign has left many Democrats wondering whether any of their candidates can go the distance. That's the ground on which Bloomberg is building his candidacy "" the deep-seated fear that Trump, for all his problems, may be more than equal to the task of winning a second term.
At the same time, many Democrats with long experience in presidential politics are baffled by Bloomberg's decision. Oh, they know he has long wanted to be president, that he looked at it seriously in several recent cycles, only to pull back and conclude that he couldn't win, and for Bloomberg, winning is the thing he wants.
Almost every attribute Bloomberg brings to the campaign is already spoken for by the current field. A mayor? There's Buttigieg or former Newark mayor Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) or former San Antonio mayor Julián Castro. A moderate? Well, there's Biden and Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) and Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana and . . . 
He's a billionaire willing to spend a fortune. So is Tom Steyer. He is a septuagenarian, if people are looking for older candidates, but so are Biden, Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). He's a successful business executive. Andrew Yang is a business success as well. 
One of Bloomberg's signature issues that might appeal to the Democratic base is gun control. Former congressman Beto O'Rourke made that his signature issue after the horrific mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, calling for mandatory confiscation of assault weapons. He dropped out a week ago. Another of Bloomberg's issues is climate change. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington based his whole campaign on that issue and he lasted only a few months before quitting the race.
Still, there is something about Bloomberg that draws outsize attention, and for reasons that go beyond his willingness to spend perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars on his campaign. He does have a record success in business and in politics. He is admired for his competence and his leadership (and his philanthropy) by fellow mayors who have worked with him over the years. 
Other Democrats are indebted to him for the money he has invested in campaigns. He has spent freely to push for action on climate change and to promote gun control legislation, including the dollars he poured into Virginia legislative races this fall that helped Democrats neutralize the National Rifle Association in the state where the NRA is headquartered. 
Still, Democrats are puzzled by his decision, wondering just how and why he thinks that, at this relatively late date, he believes he can mount a successful campaign. They acknowledge that the team around him includes smart, tough, shrewd people. They know that Bloomberg and his team are data driven and will make decisions based on their best reading of what the numbers tell them. 
They know that his money is a huge asset, even if he is attacked by Sanders and Warren for trying to buy an election. Warren responded to his entry with a welcome and an online calculator to show how much her wealth tax could cost Bloomberg. The answer: about $6 billion.
Bloomberg won't run a conventional campaign. Beyond that, he's looking to defy the odds in many ways. For example, nobody has gotten in this late and won. Retired Army Gen. Wesley Clark, who many Democrats thought had exactly the right attributes to take down then-President George W. Bush, tried a late entry in the early fall of 2003 and flopped. 
Former senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee jumped into the 2008 Republican nomination campaign in the early fall of 2007. Some Republicans thought he was the new Ronald Reagan. Instead, with minimal effort, he got nowhere.
When he was Texas's governor, Rick Perry waited until late summer of 2011 to announce his bid for the GOP nomination. The campaign of Mitt Romney, the eventual nominee, set out to destroy his candidacy and succeeded within a few months. 
Bloomberg plans to defy conventions in another way. He apparently has decided not to compete seriously in any of the four early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina (although it is not yet clear whether he will seek to qualify for the ballots in those states). 
The Democratic Party chairs of Iowa and New Hampshire issued statements late Friday lamenting Bloomberg's decision to bypass their events. 
New Hampshire's Ray Buckley said: 'We are disappointed and frankly very surprised that any candidate would launch a campaign for the White House where their path doesn't run through New Hampshire or any of the other early states.' 
Iowa's Troy Price said: 'Iowa is one of the last places where retail politics and grass-roots organizing run strong, and our process "" along with the other early states "" makes candidates and their campaigns better prepared for a general election fight.'
Those two Democrats have particular concerns about the Bloomberg strategy. If successful, it could render the Iowa-New Hampshire hegemony at the front of the nominating process moot, something politicians in other states would be happy to see. But it would mean Bloomberg could run for the nomination and rarely expose himself to direct questioning from voters.
Bloomberg is certainly taking a risk by skipping the early states. Rudolph W. Giuliani, another former New York mayor, tried essentially that same strategy in 2008. He led the polls among Republicans for much of 2007 but never settled on how he wanted to navigate Iowa or New Hampshire. Instead, he pointed to Florida as his breakout state. With poor showings earlier, however, he had no momentum by the time of Florida. His candidacy sank there.
The 2020 calendar offers Bloomberg an option this time to try again. Super Tuesday comes days after the South Carolina primary, and it will be one of the biggest single delegate hauls in history. It could also cost a fortune to compete widely. Democrats who know the financial demands of these kinds of events say it could cost $100 million to mount a television campaign across that many states, which include California and Texas.
Another Democrat who has been through the recent cycles offered this cautionary note about the value of TV ads. Presidential nominations are not won simply with blanket television advertising. It's much more about winning begetting winning and building on free media "" which is to say the news coverage and the narratives that coverage produces.
Like others in the Democratic field, Bloomberg will bring assets and liabilities to the contest. But one of his first tasks will be to persuade Democratic voters that he truly has something unique to offer.

Once-fringe movements circulate widely online
A violent parody aired this weekend at President Trump's Miami-area golf resort - and the video's mass sharing afterward - is yet another example of how Trump and the once-fringe movements of online trolls and meme-makers who support him have reshaped mainstream politics and the media.
The meme video, a spoof derived from a bloody action film, drew outrage from some for its depiction of Trump shooting journalists and attacking political figures who have been critical of him, both Democrats and Republicans. Some warned that the clip and others like it could incite real-world violence.
But that outrage also helped ensure the video, which had been available on YouTube for more than a year, would be circulated more widely. Trump's online provocateurs on Monday portrayed the parody video's viral distribution as a victory - and a reason to create more like it.
TheGeekzTeam YouTube channel, where the video is displayed, was viewed more than 129,000 times on Monday, up from an average of about 600 views a day, according to data from the tracking site Social Blade.
Some pro-Trump supporters wrote online that they were giddy that the violent video had been shared en masse, including by journalists, whose revulsion they have claimed as a badge of honor. Others said they were emboldened by the impact the video had made and would continue pushing the boundaries in future memes. One pro-Trump user early Monday tweeted that the furious reaction to the video ""is why the meme was made.""
 ""These new memes are the 21st century version of political cartoons. Get f---ed you p---ies,"" the user AllesErdreich wrote Monday on the pro-Trump Reddit forum The_Donald.

Becca Lewis, who researches online subcultures and media manipulation for Stanford University and the think tank Data & Society, said the video's sharing showed how such memes have become a potent force for political expression and propaganda. The meme creators, she said, routinely sought mainstream attention for the memes in a way that would make the shocking content seem more and more acceptable.
""The attention economy makes it so that whoever is interested in promoting the most shocking stuff ends up getting a tailor-made news cycle for themselves,"" Lewis said. ""The mainstream media gets shocked and disgusted and therefore posts the video, but that in turn gives more viewership to the video. And there's nothing the meme creators want more than to shock and disgust the mainstream media.""
The incendiary video was aired at a conference held by the pro-Trump group American Priority at Trump's golf resort in Doral, Fla., a Miami suburb, and was first reported by the New York Times. American Priority distanced itself from the video in a statement appended to its website publicizing what it called a three-day festival.
""This video was not approved, seen or sanctioned by the #AMPFest19 organizers,"" the statement said, adding that organizers were not aware of the video until contacted by the Times.

In the video, a man dressed in a suit, with Trump's head superimposed on the body, embarks on a bloody rampage in a church, targeting occupants labeled with the logos of media organizations, including The Washington Post; lawmakers including Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.); Republicans John McCain and Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah); and others including an image labeled ""Black Lives Matter."" The assault was taken from a scene in the 2014 action movie ""Kingsman: The Secret Service."" 
The news drew widespread criticism, including from Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke, who warned in a tweet that it ""will get people killed.""
Democratic lawmakers also sharply rebuked the White House. Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (N.J.), who leads the House's top tech-focused committee, described the video as ""abhorrent,"" criticizing Trump for having ""promoted extremist voices"" in a bid to boost his presidency. Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), meanwhile, fretted the incident was ""disturbing, but frankly not surprising.""
""From the beginning, Mr. Trump has cultivated support from some of the worst corners of the internet. He's used his office to elevate this toxic internet culture while ignoring the real challenges we face on social media,"" Warner said in a statement.At least one of the pro-Trump firebrands tied to the video attended a ""social media summit"" hosted by the White House in July, where Trump previously had lauded their efforts and attacked social media companies for allegedly censoring conservatives. The event sparked fresh fears that the White House was endorsing their online tactics ahead of the 2020 election.
The church-shooting video has been viewable since July 2018 on the YouTube account of TheGeekzTeam, whose subscriber count rose 1,000 on Monday to 19,000. The account, which says it is ""dedicated to pissing off liberals,"" includes more than two dozen videos celebrating Trump and tearing down his opponents. Its most recent, in August, is a spoof of the action movie ""John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,"" and shows Trump shooting up Sanders, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Andrew Yang.
TheGeekzTeam is one of several contributors to MemeWorld, a pro-Trump meme site created by a far-right Internet personality who calls himself Carpe Donktum but whose real name is Logan Cook. The self-described ""memesmith"" attended the White House social media summit in July and met personally with Trump, who called him a ""genius.""
""Trump is absolutely engaging the darkest sides of some of the most extreme people in this country right now,"" said Dipayan Ghosh, co-director of the Digital Platforms & Democracy Project and Shorenstein fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, and a former policy adviser to the Obama administration.Pro-Trump meme creators defended the video as a political parody and said the online fury over its screening at the Trump resort was overwrought because it had been played in the corner of a room away from the main conference events. In its statement, American Priority called the video ""unauthorized"" and noted it had been shown in a side room and not from the event's main stage.
A festival schedule advertised a ""MAGA Comedy Night,"" a VIP yacht party, and speeches and meet-and-greets with Donald Trump Jr., Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. Attendees could participate in sessions titled ""Memetics,"" ""Crushing Social Media Distortion and Dishonesty,"" ""To War With Words"" and ""Social Media Messages that Work.""In a statement, Carpe Donktum said that the video was ""CLEARLY satirical"" and that ""no reasonable person would believe that this video was a call to action, or an endorsement of violence towards the media.""TheGeekzTeam did not respond to a request for comment. On Monday, TheGeekzTeam's Twitter account, which calls itself a home for ""spicy Trump memes,"" posted a meme showing ""Trump Memes"" causing CNN to explode.
YouTube, which is owned by Google, added a restriction to the video Monday that forced viewers to confirm that they were adults before viewing. ""For content containing violence that is clearly fictional, we age-restrict and display a warning interstitial. We applied these protections to this video,"" said Ivy Choi, a spokeswoman for YouTube.
Twitter did not respond to a request for comment. On Monday afternoon, Carpe Donktum's Twitter account was briefly suspended for, he said, violating the social media site's copyright rules with another video. But he was quickly reinstated.
For these sites and others, the incendiary posts, tweets, photos and videos by President Trump's online allies have proved to be a vexing political and policy challenge. On one hand, the content could violate each of the sites' policies, raising fresh questions as to whether Google and Twitter have taken sufficient steps to ensure their services don't become conduits for real-world violence. At the same time, these tech giants often face criticism for going too far, particularly from Trump and his peers who claim that Silicon Valley is biased against conservatives.
The president convened the social media summit in July to take aim at sites including Facebook, Google and Twitter, while rallying some of his most fervent online supporters ahead of the 2020 election. Among the roughly 200 conservatives in the room were some of the Web's most controversial provocateurs who have shared doctored videos and spread conspiracy theories about Trump's opponents.
""Some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable,"" Trump said.
Pro-Trump meme creators have routinely built dark parodies and shareable memes from Hollywood films, superimposing the faces of journalists they dislike and the logos of media organizations onto characters getting beaten up or humiliated by a mighty Trump character.
Carpe Donktum's memes, which have often been widely boosted by Trump supporters on sites such as Reddit and Twitter, include one in which he animated former vice president Joe Biden's apology video to show the candidate caressing his own shoulders.
""Where is the genius? I want to meet the genius,"" Trump said to Carpe Donktum as the men entered the Oval Office, according to the recollection of another pro-Trump meme creator called @mad_liberals, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fear of harassment.
Memes from Carpe Donktum, a stay-at-home dad who raises money through online donations, have been tweeted or retweeted by Trump at least four times this year. One, a fake animated cover of Time magazine showing Trump remaining in the White House forever, has been viewed more than 29 million times.

All 140 seats up in General assembly 
Cash-heavy suburban races may steer results

RICHMOND - Voters go to the polls Tuesday for Virginia's most consequential legislative elections in a generation, with control of state government at stake and the results marking an early skirmish in next year's presidential contest.
An unprecedented flood of money has boosted many General Assembly races to the spending level of congressional contests. Virginia is the only state where this fall's elections will determine the balance of power in the legislature, and both national parties regard it as a proxy war over President Trump and his political future.
All 140 seats in the General Assembly are on the ballot, but much of the battle has focused on suburban districts in Northern Virginia, Richmond and Hampton Roads, where voters can swing left or right.
""Virginia has the best Unemployment and Economic numbers in the history of the State. If the Democrats get in, those numbers will go rapidly in the other direction. On Tuesday, Vote Republican!"" Trump tweeted Monday night, one of a series of presidential proclamations on the state.
""We were also named the best state for business this year. Thanks for noticing what Democratic leadership is doing for our Commonwealth!"" Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam tweeted in reply.
Trump is deeply unpopular in Virginia, and he made no visits there to boost GOP candidates. When Vice President Pence attended a campaign rally in Virginia Beach on Sunday, the Democratic Party of Virginia promoted the appearance.
Republicans are defending thin majorities of 20 to 19 in the Senate and 51 to 48 in the House of Delegates, with one vacancy in each chamber. If Democrats can take control, they could consolidate power for the first time in 26 years and work with Northam to enact legislation long blocked by Republicans.
Those include gun control, protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation, a higher minimum wage and passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. As the only former Confederate state that went for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and with its urban and suburban areas becoming increasingly diverse, Virginia is seen by Democrats as an important place to plant the flag against Trump's Republican Party.
Whoever controls the General Assembly will oversee redistricting after next year's census - influencing politics for a decade to come.
""Proud to endorse an outstanding group of Virginia Democrats in Tuesday's election - candidates who'll not only advance the causes of equality, justice, and decency, but help ensure that the next decade of voting maps are drawn fairly. That's good policy - and good for our politics,"" former president Barack Obama tweeted.
Voters will also decide a host of local races, electing successors to outgoing board of supervisors chairs Sharon Bulova (D-Fairfax) and Corey A. Stewart (R-Prince William), among others; choosing supervisors, prosecutors, school board members and sheriffs across the state; and endorsing or rejecting millions in bond issues for schools, transportation and public safety projects.
In the state legislative races, expectations are so high that coming up short of a majority in either chamber would raise questions about the Democratic Party's fitness to take on Trump in 2020.
GOP candidates warn that new liberal Democrats are out of step with traditional Virginia values and will ruin the state's business-friendly climate. Many suburban Republican candidates have attempted a difficult balancing act, posing almost like centrist Democrats for much of the summer - including blue campaign signs and literature that emphasized gun safety and health care without mentioning party affiliation - but lashing out against ""socialists"" in the final weeks.
Tuesday's elections will cap a political year that has obliterated quaint notions of a ""Virginia Way"" of bipartisan civility.
Democrats entered 2019 with tremendous momentum after making big gains in contests for the House of Delegates and Congress. After a federal court ruled that several of the state's House districts had been racially gerrymandered, judges approved an electoral map that redrew 26 districts - boosting Democrats' chances by shifting six Republicans into blue-leaning territory.
In late January, though, Democratic legislators and Northam made clumsy comments defending a bill that would have loosened restrictions on late-term abortions. Conservatives across the country erupted with charges of infanticide - something Northam, a pediatric neurologist, called ""disgusting.""
Days later, a racist photo surfaced from Northam's 1984 medical school yearbook page, depicting one person in blackface and another in Ku Klux Klan robes. Northam initially took responsibility for the photo, and most in his party called on him to resign.
But he quickly disavowed the photo, although he admitted darkening his face for a dance contest later that same year, and refused to step down. 
Within days, the state's two other top Democrats were also mired in scandal: Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax was accused by two women of separate sexual assaults in the early 2000s, both of which he denies, and Attorney General Mark R. Herring admitted that he, too, had darkened his face for a party in college in 1980.
Republicans aimed to depict Democrats as chaotic, scandal-ridden baby killers, and themselves as pragmatic centrists.
On May 31, though, tragedy disrupted state politics when a gunman killed 12 in Virginia Beach. Amid a public outcry for action, Democrats rallied around Northam, who summoned the General Assembly to a special legislative session in July to consider gun restrictions.
Republicans who control the legislature accused Democrats of cynical politics and adjourned the session after 90 minutes without debating a single bill. Instead, they referred all legislation to a state crime commission.
That was a risky move for Republicans - a recent Washington Post-Schar School poll found that gun policy is the top issue for a majority of Virginia voters. While those voters split evenly among Democrats and Republicans, even bigger majorities said they favor some form of gun control legislation.
Polls also consistently showed that most Virginians are happy with the job Northam is doing, defusing the scandal issue for Republicans. The governor's fundraising has continued to lag behind, but he returned to the campaign trail - albeit without the usual gubernatorial fly-around in the home stretch. Former governor Terry McAuliffe (D) picked up some of the slack, raising money and making campaign appearances. 
After several other states enacted harsh abortion restrictions, that topic lost some of its potency in Virginia, where suburban voters are leery of encroaching on a woman's right to choose.
Republicans in some districts have tried to revive the late-term abortion issue, hoping to energize their base. The Democratic-driven impeachment effort is also revving up the GOP, some Republicans said.
Turnout is the most crucial factor Tuesday. This is an ""off-off year,"" without statewide or federal races on the ballot to stir up voter interest. Turnout in such years in Virginia is typically very low - usually less than 30 percent. Democrats are hoping that anti-Trump fervor will get their numbers up, as it has done since 2016, and they have cranked up celebrity endorsements for good measure, including visits from actors Alec Baldwin and Kerry Washington.
Democrats said they knocked on 2.4 million doors across the state. Republicans declined to disclose their numbers.
As Pence rallied Republicans in Virginia Beach over the weekend, Democrats brought former vice president Joe Biden, a 2020 presidential contender, to a rally in Northern Virginia. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont (I-Vt.) was to stump Monday for Del. Lee Carter (D-Manassas), the only self-described socialist in the legislature. Carter faces a challenge from Republican Ian Lovejoy. 
National Democratic groups promoting abortion rights, LGBT rights, gun control and unions dispatched their national leadership to lead canvassing kickoffs in the final three days.
With turnout uncertain and with the new court-ordered boundaries that affect districts around Richmond and Hampton Roads, election officials are on guard for possible voter confusion and what could be a number of extremely close races.
In Northern Virginia, Democrats see their best pickup opportunity in the state Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Richard H. Black (R-Loudoun), a social conservative who had been able to hang on despite a changing district. Del. John Bell (D-Loudoun) has raised $2.6 million for that open seat, compared with $1.4 million by Republican Geary Higgins. Democrats also have targeted Del. Tim Hugo (R-Fairfax), a member of the GOP leadership and the last Republican House member in Northern Virginia, who faces Dan Helmer. 
Republicans, meanwhile, focused on unseating several Prince William delegates swept into office two years ago on an anti-Trump wave, including the state's first two Latina legislators, Hala Ayala and Elizabeth Guzman, and Danica Roem, Virginia's first transgender elected official. But fundraising in those races has heavily favored Democrats.
One of the most competitive House races is a rematch - Del. Wendy Gooditis (D-Clarke) vs. former Republican delegate Randy Minchew. She unseated him in 2017, when Minchew's own sister-in-law voted against him to demonstrate her disdain for Trump.
In the Richmond suburbs, two freshman Republican state senators are trying to fend off Democratic challengers in districts carried by Hillary Clinton in 2016 that have tilted bluer since. Sen. Glen H. Sturtevant Jr. (R-Richmond) faces Democrat Ghazala Hashmi, while Sen. Siobhan S. Dunnavant (R-Henrico) is trying to fend off Del. Debra H. Rodman (D-Henrico). The Dunnavant-Rodman contest is on track to be the state's most expensive, with Dunnavant raising $2.5 million and Rodman $2.8 million.
In a rural-suburban district that has remained red under Trump, Democratic challenger Amanda Pohl hopes to capitalize on a string of election-year controversies surrounding freshman Sen. Amanda F. Chase (R-Chesterfield), who wore a gun on her hip on the Senate floor, cussed out a Capitol police officer over a parking space and was ousted from her local GOP committee. But both parties say Chase's poll numbers rose after the attention.
The most prominent House race in the region pits Speaker Kirk Cox (R-Colonial Heights) against Sheila Bynum-Coleman (D). The speaker, the state's most powerful Republican, must compete in a redrawn district. The map swung from heavily favoring Republicans to tilting slightly blue. The symbolic value of the race has helped Bynum-Coleman nearly keep pace with Cox's fundraising, $1.4 million to his $1.8 million. 
Other hard-fought races in the region pit Del. Schuyler T. VanValkenburg (D-Henrico) against GayDonna Vandergriff (R); Democrat Rodney Willett vs. Republican Mary Margaret Kastelberg; and Del. Roxann L. Robinson (R-Chesterfield) vs. Democrat Larry Barnett. Two years ago, Barnett lost to Robinson by just 128 votes.
In Hampton Roads, the most-watched race is a rerun: Del. David E. Yancey (R-Newport News) faces Democrat Shelly Simonds (D) two years after their 2017 contest resulted in a tie, which was decided by a random drawing live on national television. 
Del. Chris Jones (R-Suffolk), chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, is trying to fend off Clinton Jenkins in a redrawn district that heavily favors Democrats.
Several Virginia Beach races could be pivotal in determining the balance of power and will test the potency of the gun control issue. Freshman Del. Kelly K. Convirs-Fowler (D-Virginia Beach) is in a tight race in a heavily military district against Republican challenger Shannon Kane; Del. Glenn R. Davis Jr. (R-Virginia Beach) faces Democrat Karen Mallard; and Del. Christopher P. Stolle (R-Virginia Beach) is running against Democrat Nancy Guy.
That area's two Senate seats are also competitive. Del. Cheryl B. Turpin (D-Virginia Beach) faces Republican Jen Kiggins for an open seat vacated by retired senator Frank Wagner (R-Virginia Beach), and Sen. William R. DeSteph Jr. (R-Virginia Beach) is trying to turn back a well-funded challenge by Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal.

Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg is making plans to enter the Democratic presidential primary campaign this week, a reflection of anxiety among party elites about the unsettled field of current contenders.
Bloomberg, who as one of the world's richest men would bring significant financial resources to his own campaign but also inflame the populist wing of the party, plans to file paperwork and has dispatched staff to Alabama to ensure he can get onto the ballot in a state that has a Friday filing deadline. He has been calling top party officials to let them know of his plans and could make an announcement as early as next week.
The move marks a major reversal for Bloomberg, who announced in March that he would not run for president, and also serves as a public rebuke of the performance so far of former vice president Joe Biden, who has attempted to build a coalition of the same moderate Democrats that Bloomberg would court. 
One of the driving reasons Bloomberg decided against joining the race earlier this year - he announced his decision seven weeks before Biden entered - was his view that Biden was too formidable a contender. But in the months since, Biden has been underwhelming, remaining among the race's leaders but halting in his debate performances and stumbling over raising the tens of millions necessary to mount a strong campaign.
Bloomberg adviser Howard Wolfson would not take on Biden personally in confirming the billionaire's plans but did allude to questions about the field.
""We now need to finish the job and ensure that Trump is defeated,"" Wolfson said. ""But Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that.""
Concern is also rippling through the Democratic Party over the others at the top of the candidate pile. The liberal policy positions advanced by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are seen by many as unpalatable in general election contests in the states expected to determine the winner. Sanders's health is also an issue after his October heart attack. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has attracted attention and raised substantial money, but he has little support among African Americans, one of the party's most important constituencies.
Bloomberg, 77, has been outspoken in his opposition to Warren's and Sanders's intentions to raise taxes on the extremely wealthy like himself, and on Thursday they returned the ill sentiments.
""The billionaire class is scared and they should be scared,"" Sanders wrote on Twitter after news of Bloomberg's possible entry became public.
""Welcome to the race, @MikeBloomberg!"" Warren tweeted, providing a link to the impacts her policies would have on billionaires. She also sent out a fundraising email saying ""the wealthy and well connected are scared."" 
It is still possible that Bloomberg would not ultimately enter the race, but he is taking steps to ensure he will be on the ballot. Alabama's deadline is Friday, and New Hampshire's is Nov. 15. 
The Democratic field has winnowed recently from two dozen to 16, but Bloomberg's decision could also open the door to other announcements. Former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. has not ruled out a possible entry, nor has the party's 2016 nominee, Hillary Clinton. Oprah Winfrey, an early backer of Barack Obama, has repeatedly begged Disney chief executive Bob Iger to jump into the race, but he has so far been unwilling. 
""His getting in the race is certainly going to stimulate thought and provocations that weren't there before,"" former senator Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said of Bloomberg, whom he spoke to on Thursday. He is scheduled to talk with Holder early next week.
""Bloomberg doesn't do things halfway,"" Reid added. ""He's going to stir up some conversation.""


Bloomberg has decided not to raise money for his bid if he does move forward, which would preclude him from entry in the Democratic debates under rules that require a growing number of donors to qualify. ""He has never raised a dime for his campaigns, and he is not about to start,"" said a person familiar with his thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly about the planning.
It is also possible that he decides to skip the first four voting states, an unorthodox strategy that could upend the regular nominating process and place far more emphasis on the Super Tuesday contests of March 3, when the race will become more nationalized - and more expensive. His advisers have said in the past that they did not plan to operate with a preset budget if he mounted a presidential effort. 
News of Bloomberg's potential entry was first reported by the New York Times.
Bloomberg's adviser Wolfson, in confirming his plans, highlighted his history of building a business from scratch and becoming a ""high-impact philanthropist."" He has also spent lavishly on politics, donating more than $100 million in the 2018 midterms and playing a role in Tuesday's off-year elections, in which Democrats romped in the suburbs that often yearn for a moderate standard-bearer.
Bloomberg was open earlier this year about his desire to get into the Democratic primary race. He made trips to Iowa and New Hampshire, testing the waters for a campaign before deciding against it, and instead planned to fund an independent political operation that would work against Trump. 
""I believe I would defeat Donald Trump in a general election,"" Bloomberg said in a statement in March. ""But I am clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field.""
Bloomberg is the second billionaire Democrat to reverse an earlier decision. Tom Steyer had initially decided against running but recently joined the field.
A Monmouth University poll in March found that Bloomberg was disliked by just about as many Democrats as liked him - with 27 percent viewing him favorably, 26 percent unfavorably, and nearly half saying they had no opinion or hadn't heard of him. 


Bloomberg's entrance would reignite a battle over how much the richest Americans should be taxed. In January, on one of his final New Hampshire trips before deciding against a bid, Bloomberg told The Washington Post that Warren's wealth tax was ""probably unconstitutional,"" and he warned that seriously pursuing it could wreck the country's prosperity.
""We need a healthy economy, and we shouldn't be embarrassed about our system,"" Bloomberg said. ""If you want to look at a system that's not capitalistic, just take a look at was perhaps the wealthiest country in the world, and today people are starving to death. It's called Venezuela.""
Warren, who has eschewed big-money fundraisers, had warned from the outset of her campaign that a self-funding billionaire was a threat to the party.
""We ought to be building grass-roots support,"" Warren told reporters after her very first campaign event of 2019, in Council Bluffs, Iowa. ""We ought to be building a movement. And the way we do that is with lots of involvement from lots of people. Not having billionaires buy these campaigns, whether we're talking about super PACs or self-funding.""
Bloomberg's entrance would give her and Sanders another foil but could pose challenges not only to Biden and Buttigieg but a host of moderates who have struggled to gain traction, including Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and Sens. Michael F. Bennet (Colo.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) 
""I still believe Biden is best positioned to defeat Trump, but Bloomberg obviously fears that Warren or Sanders might prevail in the primary and then end up losing to Trump,"" said Jon Cooper, a Democratic fundraiser and prominent Biden supporter. ""For those more centrist Democrats who share that concern, Bloomberg's entry into the race could offer a belt-and-suspenders approach.""
When he decided not to run earlier this year, Bloomberg's advisers had pointed to the apparent strength of other moderate potential candidates, most notably Biden. But he has grown increasingly concerned, particularly as impeachment proceedings have threatened to ensnare Biden over his actions regarding Ukraine. 
""As incredibly concerned as Mike was about Trump remaining president, after Ukraine he become ever more concerned. He is convinced the president is an existential threat,"" said the person familiar with Bloomberg's thinking. 
""We have seen in data that Democrats are extremely focused on nominating the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump. There is a supreme desire to have the best possible candidates to run in November. We think we can make a very, very strong case that that is Mike Bloomberg,"" the person said.

NEW YORK - It was Week 3 of the ongoing impeachment inquiry, and Joanne Vega was only beginning to pay attention, the details sifting into her consciousness as she half-listened to Fox News or caught snippets on the radio driving to her job caring for special-needs children. Now, outside the Bagel Bin on Staten Island, she lit a cigarette.

""So, they said he was on the phone with some guy because he wanted to get dirt on Biden, but I don't know if they got any proof of that,"" she said, taking a drag. ""And it was something else, too - I don't know. Rudy's doing it? Rudy called?""

As the investigation heads into its second month, this is how the facts and disinformation surrounding the possible impeachment of the 45th president of the United States are seeping into the minds of voters in New York's 11th Congressional District, a swath of the country as good a place as any to gauge how a defining moment in American democracy is playing out.
There is confusion about the details, especially as those details become ever more intricate. There is also an evolving sense of what is at stake - not so much among Democrats, whose reactions have changed little, moving from ""that mofo needs to go"" in the first week to ""they should nail his ass"" in the fourth, but among Trump supporters, whose opinions matter to Republican lawmakers who could ultimately decide the president's fate.
""It's all nonsense,"" one of those supporters said in the first days of the inquiry.
""I'm watching it very closely,"" another said last week.
The district they live in encompasses a sliver of un-gentrified Brooklyn and all of Staten Island, the ""forgotten borough"" of New York City that is home to many civil servants, police officers, firefighters and the Wu Tang Clan. It has an expressway that locals call the ""Mason-Dixon line,"" which roughly divides the more diverse, more Democratic northern crescent of the borough from the whiter, more Republican rest of it. Its voters backed Donald Trump for president in 2016 and elected to Congress in 2018 a Democratic centrist named Max Rose who has called progressives ""hipster socialists"" and a GOP opponent ""a mouth-pisser.""

For any voter, there has been a lot to process in the inquiry - a country called Ukraine, a whistleblower, another whistleblower, Rudolph W. Giuliani, Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, various ambassadors, and two men named Igor and Lev. There has been real news and fake news, and all of that has been pouring through a filter of mistrust evident here since the earliest days of the investigation, when Gregory Berg said he felt like he was being dragged into something he wished to avoid.
""Look, I care about infrastructure,"" he said one afternoon, ranking that as a priority far above the impeachment of a president he supports.
By then, the first crucial facts had come to light: A whistleblower alleged that President Trump had called the Ukrainian president and asked him to investigate discredited allegations about the son of Joe Biden, a potential 2020 rival. A summary of the phone call had documented this, after which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had opened the impeachment inquiry, saying the president had ""seriously violated the Constitution.""
Meanwhile, on the following Sunday, people had been out at a street fair.
""You put on the news and all you hear is impeachment,"" said Linda Sagebick, whose priority remained her medical bills. ""I got stitches that cost me $8,000,"" she said, walking with two friends past stands selling mangoes, sunglasses and ""Trump 2020: No More Bull----"" hats.
""We got the problem of opioids here, and homelessness,"" said Mike Rehberg, a retired firefighter.
""Things like that are much more important to us than what Donald Trump said to Ukraine,"" added Brian Pritchard, a retired fire captain who did not support Trump but shared the widespread sense that whatever was about to happen would be motivated by ""politics"" rather than the nation's best interests.
It was a cynicism that transcended party lines, even as Week 2 of the impeachment inquiry began.
""They're all corrupt,"" Michael Bisignano, who supports Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) in their presidential runs
, said while working on his laptop at Fab Cup. ""They're all addicted to power and money, and impeachment is just taking us away from what's really going on. Health care, global warming - people are really suffering in this country.""
By that point in the inquiry, a second whistleblower had emerged. House Democrats had subpoenaed Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, who had acknowledged that he was working on behalf of Trump to gather damaging information about Biden, Biden's son and others. Trump had said that his call with the Ukrainian president was ""perfect,"" and a conspiracy theory was taking hold that the inquiry was only the latest ""witch hunt"" and ""coup attempt"" against the president.
Behind the counter at the Bagel Bin, Joe Mastrapaolo was just trying to keep up.
""To be honest, it's overwhelming,"" he said.He'd stopped watching CNN and turned to Fox. He'd stopped watching Fox and turned to the even more pro-Trump One America News Network. He'd stopped watching OANN and started watching YouTube videos featuring psychics.
""Who do you trust anymore?"" he said to a customer ordering a roast beef sandwich. ""Like this week, I heard they changed the whistleblower law or something? Doesn't the law say a whistleblower has to have firsthand knowledge of what took place?""
""I can't remember,"" said the customer, Paul Solaequi, a retired transit worker. ""I'm so tired. Joe, I need a pound of coleslaw.""
Over by a rack of potato chips, a woman named Janice, a retired civil servant who did not want to give her last name, was trying to put it all together.
""So, they have this whistleblower, right?"" she began. ""And the whistleblower is part of the government, I dunno what agency, right? Seems like a plan to me. It doesn't seem real. It seems like they're doing whatever they have to do to take him down. It's very complicated.""
She went to the counter, where sheets of notebook paper with handwritten prices of bagels, coffee and beer were taped to the Formica, and Sandra Villacampa was ringing up customers.
""You know Max Rose?"" Villacampa said to one of them, referring to the congressman who had just held a town hall event. ""He did that pro-impeachment speech and he's going to pay.""
She pointed to a stack of newspapers under the counter. ""Congressman criticized for impeachment inquiry decision,"" the headline read.
That decision had also come during the second week of the inquiry, when Rose had faced 200 voters and declared, ""The American people have a right to know if our president used the power of his office to get a foreign power to interfere in our election."" He had spent the rest of the time fielding audience questions about senior express bus fares and $18 bridge tolls, but the inquiry was still looming over the conversations.
""Maybe some of it has some validity,"" said Candace Crupi, a Trump supporter.
""He's not a perfect person,"" said her friend Michele Kunz, who also supports Trump.
By the third week, as more administration officials were coming forward to say there was more to the Ukraine matter than Trump's phone call, national polls were starting to show a slim majority of the public supporting the inquiry, including an uptick among Republican voters.At the Bagel Bin, Joe Tompkins was not quite one of those, not yet.
He described himself as a ""gay sheet-metal worker,"" a disillusioned Democrat turned Trump supporter. He had read the whistleblower complaint and found its professionalism ""suspicious"" rather than convincing. He had watched the Democratic leader of the impeachment inquiry, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), paraphrase the complaint during a congressional hearing, and thought Schiff was ""a total joke."" He had seen how Trump was reacting, and thought the president was ""a total and complete buffoon"" capable of anything, and all of this had left him saying, ""I'd be open to it if I saw that the facts were there.""
On the front page of the newspapers under the counter, a headline read, ""Stone Wall vs Dems,"" and a story on Page 7 was about a White House letter sent to House Democrats calling the impeachment inquiry ""baseless"" and ""unconstitutional"" and refusing to respond to congressional subpoenas. A customer buying a gallon of milk glanced at the cover.
""The cynic in me thinks it's a witch hunt, but the realist in me thinks it was quid pro quo,"" said the man, who gave his name only as Fallon, explaining that he worked in law enforcement.
He was a Libertarian-leaning Republican and was no fan of Schiff, saying, ""When you rush to the podium to embarrass someone, that tells me you have other motives.""
On the other hand, he said, ""I'm firmly behind the rule of law, and if they have enough proof to impeach the president, they need to move forward.""
Later, Joe Garofolo, who owns the Bagel Bin, was behind the counter, his cellphone beeping with news alerts about the latest developments.
""I try not even to listen to half of it - I get aggravated,"" said Garofolo, a Democrat who was usually in the minority in his own store.
""Can I get two Advil PMs?"" a customer asked.
""He should be impeached, but as long as the Republicans are in [control of] the Senate, they're not going to go against him,"" Garofolo said. ""Every one of them is compromised. I think they're all corrupt, every one of them.""
""Whatever,"" said another customer.
""Whatever?!"" Garofolo said. ""Well, the president is not supposed to ask foreign countries to go against his opponent, that's whatever.""
He tried to stay calm.
A regular named Gary came in and offered his solidarity.
""He's walking around like he's untouchable,"" he told Garofolo. ""They should nail his ass.
""
And now Robert Rusello was at the counter. He was a Trump supporter who was only beginning to tune in to the news about impeachment.

But now Trump was moving on to a different subject. Syria. Turkey. U.S. troops. A different phone call with a different president.
""Don't get me wrong,"" Rusello said. ""If he did something illegal with - who was it, Turkey? Or Syria?""
He paused for a moment, trying to keep it all straight.
""Ukraine,"" he said. ""That's the thing. If he did something illegal, then that's no good.""
Now it was the beginning of the fourth week. Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas had been arrested and charged with campaign finance violations, legal experts were saying the United States was descending into a constitutional crisis, Congress was on its way back to Washington to sort it all out, and that was what Richard Wickstrom was trying to do.
He was a retired system analyst and ""reluctant Trump supporter"" who had stopped watching Fox News and turned to CNN. He'd stopped watching CNN and turned to the BBC, and now he was following the news almost hour to hour.
""I think what he did was wrong,"" Wickstrom said. ""Was he criminal in it? I don't know. I think he went overboard. Was it a treasonous thing?""
He was not sure whether the 45th president of the United States should be removed from office. But in this fourth week, he wanted to know more.
""I want to see what comes out of the woodwork,"" he said.

NORCROSS, Ga. "" Four Gwinnett County Democratic Party leaders gathered on living-room couches to hash out how to motivate voters for a runoff election in a few weeks, a Democratic presidential primary in a few months, a regular primary several weeks after that and then the 2020 general election. 
But first they had a more pressing priority: In less than a month, Republican state leaders plan to purge the registrations of 330,000 voters who haven't participated in recent elections "" roughly 22,000 of whom are registered in Gwinnett County, many of them probably Democrats. They spent hours debating how best to find these voters and keep them registered, and organizing phone banks, including one ahead of a Democratic debate watch party Wednesday night.
Then came a text message from another county party member who had heard that the state party was organizing a similar effort, as was a nonprofit group. 
'We don't have time for this,' Bianca Keaton, the first black woman to lead the Gwinnett County Democrats, said with exasperation. 'We are moving ahead with the plan we made this morning. I don't want them in Gwinnett County.'
The exchange was yet another reminder that while Democrats see themselves as poised to take over the state, they are a long way from building the kind of coordinated effort that Georgia Republicans "" and Democrats in places like Virginia and elsewhere "" have long enjoyed. Turning the historically red state blue, it turns out, is harder to pull off than to predict. 
Democrats see growing and diversifying suburban counties like Gwinnett, northeast of Atlanta, as their pathway to winning statewide, a potential shift largely driven by the tens of thousands who move to the Atlanta area each year from other states and countries.

Over the past 30 years, Gwinnett County has undergone a rapid and dramatic transformation from a sleepy bedroom community that was overwhelmingly white and conservative to a bustling and diverse county that has the second-largest population in the state.
In 2016, Gwinnett was one of just six counties in the nation to vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton for president after backing Republican nominees in the two previous cycles. (Three of the six are in the Atlanta suburbs.) In 2018, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams won the county by 14 points, more than double Clinton's margin, and several Democrats were elected to local seats long held by Republicans. 
'What we've had here is an awakening,' said Keaton, who grew up in Chicago. 'We're coming out of an era where Democrats operated but were closeted. It's only just now that it's okay to be a Democrat. . . . You can be a Democrat and actually win here.' 
Abrams's run for governor showed Democrats what is possible. She lost the state by about 55,000 votes "" and since then, more than 300,000 Georgians have registered statewide. 
Abrams has urged national Democrats to invest heavily in the state in 2020, noting that it will probably be the only state with two U.S. Senate races. Democrats plan to hold a presidential primary debate Wednesday at the new Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta "" angering some suburban Democrats who say their counties better illustrate what's happening in the state. 
'If you just focus on Atlanta, you're going to miss all of the energy that's bubbling on the edges,' Keaton said. 
The Gwinnett County Republican Party, meantime, is scrambling to retain power in a county that's quickly changing. Edward Muldrow, the county party's new chairman, gets frustrated with people who move to the county for its well-regarded schools, more affordable houses and jobs "" and then want to change the political composition.
'A lot of people want their school board to look like where they came from. The problem with that is that our school board is doing a hell of a job,' said Muldrow, an African American Air Force combat veteran originally from Miami. 'Why mess with that?' 
But Muldrow has been urging the mostly white members of his party to embrace the demographic changes and enthusiastically support conservative nonwhite candidates. 
'Either you don't know how to change or you don't want to change,' he said. 'Don't be afraid of change, because things are changing. Don't retreat and cry about it. Embrace the change.' 
'A new perspective'


The county Democratic Party is headquartered in a former Abercrombie - Fitch clothing store on the second floor of the Gwinnett Place Mall, nearly directly on top of the local Republican Party headquarters, which occupies another former retail spot on the first floor. A life-size cardboard cutout of President Trump is stationed behind a counter where a cash register once stood. 
When the mall opened in Duluth in 1984, Gwinnett County had just seen a population boom as whites moved away from Atlanta, swinging the county's politics from Democratic to Republican. The county's roughly 230,000 residents were overwhelmingly white.
Since then, the population has tripled and the county is now majority minority: Whites make up 37 percent of the population, while blacks are 27 percent, Hispanics 21 percent and Asians 12 percent, according to estimates provided by the Atlanta Regional Commission. Students in Gwinnett County public schools come from 181 countries and speak 100 languages.
As if a metaphor for change, the mall slowly lost its customers and stores to another mall constructed in the late 1990s, newly developed historic downtowns and smaller shopping centers packed with noodle shops, matcha and bubble tea cafes, taquerias, Korean barbecue and sushi restaurants, bodegas, Asian markets and boutiques selling quinceañera dresses. Today, more than half of the mall storefronts are empty but there are still two major anchors: a Macy's and a Mega Mart, a Korean market that moved into a former department store.
Some new arrivals are surprised when they log on to county government websites and see photos of elected leaders, said Kirkland Carden, 31, an Ohio native and the first African American elected to the Duluth City Council, who is now running for the county board of commissioners. Three of the five commissioners are white Republicans, and four of the five school board members are white.
'Gwinnett is competitive,' Carden said, 'but I don't think we're as blue as people think. There's a lot of room to grow.' 

The same night Clinton won the county, energizing Democrats, Sam Park "" the son of Korean immigrants who grew up in the county "" became the first openly gay lawmaker elected to the statehouse. Since then, a series of young, nonwhite politicians have won local elections, and Democrats took control of the county's statehouse delegation in 2018.
'The next generation is coming into its own,' Park said, 'and it has a new perspective.'
Republican leaders in the county are trying to make the case that they are not all old, white men "" and that their party's values could line up with those of nonwhite conservatives, especially those actively involved with churches. The windows of the county GOP headquarters are decorated with the hashtag #walkaway, a conservative movement that urges nonwhites to walk away from the Democratic Party.
Complicating the effort is that Republicans in Georgia have embraced Trump, who is increasingly scorned in suburbs nationwide, and conservative causes like severely limiting access to abortion. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) said in a 2018 campaign ad that he drives 'a big truck, just in case I need to round up criminal illegals.' But since taking office, Kemp has proposed a limited expansion of Medicaid and surprised his critics by appointing minorities to judicial and criminal justice positions. 

Muldrow is defensive of the president, saying criticizing Trump would show weakness. 
'We always accuse the Democrats of being wishy-washy and twisting the narrative. In the GOP, for too long, we've been okay with weak leadership,' Muldrow said. 'Love him or hate him, he's a Republican president and what the Republican president says or does, so be it.' 
On Saturday evening, the Georgia Chinese-American Republicans "" formerly known as Chinese Americans for Trump "" gathered in the mall office to recognize several dozen high school students, several of whom gave speeches that praised Trump.
'Everyone of you here tonight is the future of our country, plain and simple,' Muldrow said in addressing the audience of more than 60 and a handful of journalists from local Asian media outlets. Muldrow then asked everyone to stand and chant: 'We are keeping America great! We are keeping America great!' 
Several in the audience said they immigrated to the United States to escape communism or socialism in their home countries "" and are now alarmed by some of the things they hear during the Democratic debates. 
Yet much of the potential, for either side, seems untapped. Wandering the hallways at the mall Friday were local residents who said they had never been contacted in any way by either party. 
Ictiandro Sarduy, who moved to the United States in 2005 from Cuba and works as a mechanic, said that he votes in most major elections for Democrats but mostly avoids talk of politics and doesn't know anything about the 2020 candidates. 
To the 36-year-old immigrant, Gwinnett County is the American Dream: Work is plentiful, people are kind, and the cost of living is lower than in Northern Virginia, where he first moved after leaving Cuba. Within two years of moving to the county, he was able to save enough money to buy a house. He recently attended a Thanksgiving dinner at his daughter's school in Lawrenceville and marveled at the diversity. 'I didn't see a lot of white kids,' he said. 
Janell Smith and Darius Watts, a black couple in their 20s who live in nearby DeKalb County, the strongest Democratic county in the state, said they have never voted "" although Watts thinks that he might next year because he wants Trump out of office. They could name two of the numerous Democratic candidates: Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) and 'the vice president from Obama.' Watts said it's difficult to find time to research as he works several jobs, including as a server at a Chinese restaurant and splitting firewood, but he hopes to do so in the next year. 
A daunting task

On the second floor of the mall a few nights earlier, Gwinnett County Democratic Party officers gathered for their monthly meeting, which was frequently derailed by debates over who needed to do what and exactly how much the growing party could demand from its volunteers. 
Over the past several months, the county party has spent much of its time composing bylaws and other governing documents, and rebranding with 
new signage, T-shirts and an upgraded website that has yet to launch. All of that building has taken time, frustrating members who are tired of meetings that can drag on for hours and would rather be out organizing. 
At the meeting, several members expressed concern that the diversity committee had not been meeting and lacked anything beyond 'black and white diversity.' Others asked when the party would finally compile a list of county events, especially multicultural ones, so they could attend and the party could begin being a regular presence. One member urged the group to do more to engage the diverse potential voters who packed the county but can be difficult to reach and reluctant to get politically involved. 
Keaton responded that the party would do all of these things "" but first, they have to build the proper infrastructure so that they are fully prepared for the high-profile year ahead. Each of the elections next year is an opportunity to harness the immense potential of the county. Clinton and Abrams have shown that Democrats can win this county, and now comes the difficult task of winning enough votes to dramatically offset Republican ballots in dozens of other counties. 
It's a daunting task for the team of volunteers. 
'It's almost December,' Keaton said, 'and we have so much that needs to be done.'
There is widespread optimism that Democrats will lodge another round of victories in the county in 2020, but the idea of a Democratic presidential candidate winning the state remains elusive to some.
'I say that we have to win in 2020 "" and I'm very serious about that "" but, in reality, it's really 2022 or 2024,' said Michael Murphy-McCarthy, who helped found a local Indivisible activist group after the 2016 election and then reluctantly got involved with the party. 
'When I first got involved, I was just angry, and I went to a lot of protests. . . . Now, I take the long view.'

Beset by impeachment inquiry, he aims to show voters he's hard at work

PALM BEACH, Fla. "" As Democrats in Congress push to impeach him, President Trump has toured a manufacturing plant in Texas, boasted about economic gains and signed numerous bills. He served turkey to U.S. troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving and grieved with the families of fallen service members at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware.
And next week, Trump is scheduled to jet to London to meet with European allies and be received at Buckingham Palace by Queen Elizabeth II. 
Sure, Trump has been consumed by the impeachment proceedings, popping off daily, if not hourly, about what he dubs a 'hoax.' But he and his aides also have staged photo opportunities and public events designed to showcase the president on the job "" a strategy one year out from the election to convince the American people that he is hard at work for them at the same time that Democrats are trying to remove him from office.
'I'm working my ass off,' Trump told a thunderous rally crowd of roughly 20,000 on Tuesday night in Sunrise, Fla. He added: 'The failed Washington establishment is trying to stop me because I'm fighting for you and because we're winning. It's very simple.'
Trump is taking a page out of the Clinton playbook. Then-President Bill Clinton survived his 1998 impeachment in part because the economy was roaring and because he appeared to many voters to be relentlessly focused on doing the business of the American people. When Clinton left office in 2001, Gallup measured his job approval rating at 66 percent.
Clinton had a built-in advantage that Trump does not enjoy: popularity. Throughout his second term, Clinton's approval rating hovered in the high 50s and 60s, whereas Trump's has been mired below 50 percent.
Still, Clinton's experience has been instructive to Trump, who recently met in the Oval Office with former Clinton strategist Mark Penn, who counseled the president to focus on governing and travel frequently.
David Axelrod, who served as senior adviser in the Obama White House, said Trump's strategy has been 'smart politics,' though he noted that it remains to be seen whether the famously undisciplined president will sustain it through a likely Senate impeachment trial.
'The images of the president with cheering troops and performing other magisterial and ministerial functions of the office are a way of signifying that he is still in command, doing the job, rather than on the run,' Axelrod said.
Trump interrupted his Thanksgiving vacation here in Florida with a 36-hour trip to Afghanistan, where he made a surprise visit to Bagram air base and announced that he intended to draw down forces in America's longest war and had resumed peace negotiations with the Taliban after he had scuttled them in September.
Trump rallied about 1,500 uniformed military personnel packed into a hangar at Bagram, many of them cheering at the presence of the commander in chief, and was joined onstage by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who did not hold back in his praise.
'President Trump, people talked a lot about bin Laden, but what you did to eliminate al-Baghdadi "" who was an organizer and not a talker "" is a much greater accomplishment. Congratulations,' Ghani said, referring to the killings of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011 and of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi earlier this month.
Trump has succeeded in drawing plaudits from other validators as well. Last Wednesday, during a day of blockbuster hearings in Congress "" including U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland's testimony implicating Trump in a quid pro quo with Ukraine "" the president was in Austin visiting a factory where Apple's Mac Pro desktop computers are manufactured.
Apple chief executive Tim Cook led Trump on the tour and credited the president with helping revive American manufacturing. When Trump asked, 'What would you say about our economy compared to everybody else?' Cook replied, 'I think we have the strongest economy in the world right now.'
Trump drew some criticism for the visit: He took credit for opening the factory when in fact Apple computers have been assembled there since 2013, three years before Trump's election.
Regardless, the images of Trump outside of Washington, walking a factory floor and showcasing a tech product, delivered the intended message, in the estimation of Republican public relations professionals.
'This is the right strategy for the president: Show the American people that he is focused on doing his job while Washington Democrats chase the great white whale of impeachment,' said Michael Steel, a former senior aide to former House speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio).
Trump likes to brag about how much he is getting done. 'We're doing things that no president has ever done before, and you've got to be very, very happy,' he told supporters at the Sunrise rally.
But other than the strong economy and the successful Baghdadi raid, Trump has had few tangible achievements in recent months. His legislative agenda has all but stalled since Democrats took control of the House at the beginning of the year, and the trade agreement his administration negotiated with Canada and Mexico hangs in the balance as it awaits congressional approval.
'There's a huge difference between photo ops that are designed to give people the impression that work is getting done and really doing the work and actually demonstrating results,' said Don Baer, a former Clinton White House adviser. 'The Trump White House is going to have to figure out how it begins to put real results on the table for the public in terms of things it's doing instead of just telling people that things are getting done.'
Jason Miller, a former Trump campaign adviser who has been recording a pro-Trump radio show and podcast, 'War Room: Impeachment,' said it is critical that the president show voters that he is focused on doing his job "" especially as his reelection campaign intensifies.
'President Trump is a born leader, so these events come naturally for him, and looking to 2020, can anyone really imagine Elizabeth Warren opening an Apple factory, Bernie Sanders greeting troops overseas, or Joe Biden negotiating with foreign leaders without Hunter there cutting side deals?' Miller said, taking shots at three of the leading Democratic presidential candidates, including a reference to Biden's son, that echo the message of the president's campaign toward Trump's potential 2020 rivals. Hunter Biden has been criticized for his foreign business dealings but has denied wrongdoing.
Lacking a bevy of big achievements of late, Trump has striven to make a show of whatever he can. On Monday, he invited journalists into the Oval Office to observe him signing the Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture Act.
The law revises criminal penalties for creating or distributing videos or images depicting animal torture. The bill did not require much of a lift "" it passed the House by voice vote and the Senate by unanimous consent "" but the president celebrated its passage nonetheless.
'This is something that should've happened a long time ago and it didn't,' Trump said. 'I ask the same question I asked for another bill that we just signed: Why hasn't this happened a long time ago? And I give you the same answer: because Trump wasn't president.'

The Democratic presidential candidates are focused inward for the moment, talking to the voters who will participate in the primaries and caucuses next year. They are also looking at one another, doing their own cost-benefit analyses of whether to go on the attack against a rival or play their own game and let others fight. 
That tension is what enlivened the second half of Thursday's Democratic debate in Los Angeles, when Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) both went after South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Warren attacked him for taking money from rich people at fancy venues, including a wine cave in California; Klobuchar questioned his electability. 
To Warren, fundraising at high-dollar events such as the ones Buttigieg attended is a symbol of how big money has polluted and corrupted politics. But Buttigieg called her attack hypocritical, saying she had raised money the very same way as a Senate candidate, only to swear it off as a presidential hopeful. He noted, however, that some of that money had been transferred to her current campaign. 'Did it corrupt you, senator?' he asked. 'Of course not.'

There will be more of this kind of debating over the next few months, as voters begin to be heard in Iowa and New Hampshire and elsewhere, and as the field of candidates begins to shrink to those who are able to amass delegates. The jockeying will intensify as this takes place.
But while the outcome of the Democratic Party nomination may be influenced by such pointed personal issues, the general election will turn on broader points. This is why a question about the economy posed in the first hour of Thursday's debate previewed the challenges the eventual Democratic nominee will face in the campaign against President Trump. 
PBS NewsHour's Judy Woodruff asked the candidates how they would appeal to voters who, while not being enthusiastic about Trump's conduct, do like the state of the economy, and thus might be reluctant to risk changing presidents. 
The Democrats who answered Woodruff challenged the premise of the question instead of giving a direct answer.
'I don't think they really do like the economy,' former vice president Joe Biden responded. 'The middle class is getting killed. The middle class is getting crushed. And the working class has no way up.'
Buttigieg agreed. 'The biggest problem in our economy is simple,' he said. 'People are not getting paid enough. That is not the result of some mysterious cosmic force. It's the result of bad policy. And we've got to change it by raising wages and empowering workers.'
Warren said most Americans are not enjoying the fruits of the expanding economy and pointed to a corruption of the governing process as the cause. 'When you see a government that works great for the wealthy and the well connected and for no one else, that is corruption, pure and simple,' she said.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) agreed. 'Today in America, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth, more income and wealth inequality than since the 1920s,' he said. 'We need an economy that works for working families, not just the 1 percent.'

Andrew Yang, who often talks more creatively about the future economy than the other candidates, said there is very little connection between many of the economic statistics and the lived lives of most Americans. 'GDP and corporate profits are at record highs in America today,' he said. 'Also at record highs? Depression, financial insecurity, student loan debt. . . . It has gotten so bad that our life expectancy as a country has declined for the last three years.'
The responses from those on the debate stage represented standard Democratic critiques about the economy, focusing on the insecurity of many working families. The observations are not incorrect. The gap between the super wealthy and the rest of the country is large, and many families are struggling with the costs of health care or education, two tentpole issues for the Democrats. 

A Brookings Institution analysis of a recent report from the Congressional Budget Office highlighted the degree to which middle-class incomes have not kept pace, growing more slowly than those at the top or even those below them. The outlook for the immediate future is better but overall not fast enough to catch up.
Many of those same conditions existed when Democrats last held the White House, and while the policies of the Obama administration helped bring the U.S. economy back after the 2008 financial collapse and put it on a growth path, they did not exactly alleviate the personal economic conditions that the presidential candidates cited on Thursday.
Trump may have inherited a growing economy from Barack Obama, but the economy has continued to grow during his tenure: Unemployment is at a half-century low; joblessness among minorities has continued to decline. The expansion that began in 2009 is now the longest in U.S. history. That is a record the Trump campaign will sell hard between now and November.
A few months ago, there were signs of trouble ahead for the economy. Today, those threats have lessened, though who can say with certainty where things will be a year or 18 months from now. Nonetheless, a new poll for CNN found that 76-percent of Americans rate the economy as very or somewhat good, up from a year ago and the highest recorded since February 2001.

One solution offered by the Democrats is higher taxes on the wealthy to produce revenue for investment elsewhere. Depending on the policies advocated, not just those in the top 1 percent, or even 10 percent, could see their taxes increase. 
Some economists see risks in some ideas the Democrats are talking about. But when Warren was confronted Thursday with their statements saying her tax proposals could stifle economic growth, she dismissed their views: 'Oh, they're just wrong,' she said.
That ended the matter at Thursday's debate, but such glib answers will not end the debate during the general election.
Between incumbency and the statistical strength of the economy, Trump has, by historical standards, a real advantage in his bid for a second term. Democrats did not offer a clear counter to that on Thursday night. Whether they will need to do so is what makes 2020 potentially different. 
The Democratic debate came a day after Democrats in the House impeached Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The outcome in the Republican-led Senate seems preordained: acquittal by a party-line vote. But the whole impeachment proceeding has highlighted the real fault line in the electorate, which has so much to do with long-standing attitudes "" good and bad "" about the president.
The president's approval rating on the economy is far better than his overall approval rating. Which will be more determinative in the election? Will voters set aside positive views of the economy and vote against him because they find other aspects of his conduct reprehensible? Or will they set aside their negative views of him personally and vote to reelect him because they are satisfied with the economy and potentially worried about what would happen under a Democratic president?
What role the state of the economy will play is a big question heading into the election year. But thus far, Democrats are only offering partial answers.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been mostly sure-footed in her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. One exception is health care. On Friday, she issued another proposal to go along with her support for Medicare-for-all, a step that appeared designed to put her into a safer place politically.
Warren's progression on health care through the course of the campaign has taken her from a position of flexibility to one of seeming inflexibility "" at least until Friday. Over a period of months, she walked herself into a place that many Democrats feared could make her chances of winning a general election more, not less, difficult. Whether Friday's turn alleviates those worries remains to be seen.
From the start, Warren's mantra as a candidate has been her advocacy of 'big structural change' to rebalance a system she says is tilted to the biggest corporations and to the wealthy and the well-connected rather than the rest of society.
She issued a series of plans covering things such as child care and college costs and housing, ambitious and costly initiatives that she said would pay for with a new wealth tax on people with fortunes of $50 million or more. She promises to take on the big banks and drug companies and the tech giants. She supports political reforms that would diminish the power of special interests and big money in politics.
One piece was always missing in those early days. That was a health-care plan. Warren has sought to bring rigor to her policy proposals, and as every candidate and president has learned, health care is the knottiest, most complex and seemingly insoluble of the big issues. She seemed in no rush to put her own stamp on a plan until she was ready.
Like all the candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, she shared the goal of assuring universal and affordable health-care coverage to all Americans. She was for Medicare-for-all rhetorically but hesitated to offer her own distinctive plan, perhaps knowing that this could be a 10-year project and one that might be done in small steps or in a big bang. 
During a CNN town hall meeting in March, she said, 'When we talk about Medicare-for-all, there are a lot of different pathways. What we're all looking for is the lowest-cost way to make sure that everybody gets covered.'
She took a fateful step away from that position during the first Democratic debate in June in Miami. Asked by NBC News's Lester Holt who would support eliminating private insurance, she raised her hand. Moments later, she cast her lot with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has long been the most vocal advocate of replacing the current employer-based insurance system with a single-payer government-managed system. 'I'm with Bernie on Medicare-for-all,' she said that night.
That helped to widen a fault line in the Democratic field between those like Warren and Sanders, who were calling for the elimination of private insurance, and those like former vice president Joe Biden and others, who proposed building on the Affordable Care Act by adding a public option but not jettisoning the current structure.
Warren further isolated herself by declining to explain how she would pay for Medicare-for-all "" in contrast with Sanders. The senator readily acknowledged that, under his proposal, middle-class families would pay higher taxes. But he argued that the shift to a single-payer system would result in lower overall costs to those families for their health-care coverage and therefore was well worth it. 
Warren, under repeated questioning and criticism from her rivals, would not answer directly. She tried to deflect by saying that she would not sign a plan that would mean higher health-care costs for middle-class Americans. To her critics and even some of her supporters, it was an evasive and unsatisfying answer, particularly coming from someone who had detailed answers to questions about her other proposals.
Then a few weeks ago, just before a big Iowa Democratic Party fundraising dinner that drew all the candidates, Warren answered her critics by issuing a financing plan for Medicare-for-all. She had experts who vouched for the soundness of the financing plan, but other experts picked it apart as unrealistic, based on some overly rosy assumptions. To the broader audience of Democrats, it didn't pass muster. 
For those with doubts about her viability as a general election candidate, the proposal only added to their worries. Politically it fell far short of what she might have hoped. It opened her up to fresh charges that she was advocating a health-care plan that lacks majority support in the country and didn't have a sound plan to pay for it. 
Many in her party worried that if she became the nominee, she would be handing President Trump's reelection campaign ammunition on an issue "" health care "" that long has been more favorable to Democrats 
Conversations with Democrats over the past two weeks have underscored the degree to which the whole issue was becoming a potential obstacle to a campaign that otherwise has been doing many things right. 'It froze a lot of people,' a still-uncommitted New Hampshire Democrat said last weekend.
Warren has prided herself on being a fighter for the causes she believes in, and she and her campaign team have aggressively pushed her health-care plan, even at the doorstep with voters. One Democrat said that a Warren field organizer knocked on his door recently and during the conversation initiated a defense of her plan and explained why she could win a general election with that position.
All of which makes what Warren did on Friday potentially significant. In short, she said that in her first 100 days she would try to enact legislation that would allow, but not require, Americans to purchase a government health-care plan "" in other words, a public option akin but not identical to those proposed by Biden; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.); and others.
Warren also said that she would wait until the third year of her presidency to begin to enact a Medicare-for-all plan, a more gradual approach than she had seemingly described in the past and one would allow her to try to build public support before plunging into something as daunting as this would be.
Warren will try to argue that the changes she proposes during the transition period are more ambitious than those of her rivals, in keeping with her pledge to be the candidate of big structural change. But she already has come under criticism for a change in positions and will face many more in the weeks ahead as she tries to explain the evolution of her thinking.
What Warren did on Friday could help to ease the fears of Democrats that she would be a vulnerable general-election candidate advocating positions that are politically unpalatable. But she is a long way from becoming the nominee. Medicare-for-all proved to be a problem for her and, while she may be on slightly safer ground today than a week ago, she hasn't fully solved the problem.

It's largest quarterly haul
 so far this year among 
Democratic contenders
Sen. Bernie Sanders raised $25.3 million during the past three months for his White House bid, his campaign said Tuesday, fueled by an army of low-dollar donors to post the largest quarterly haul so far this year among the Democratic presidential contenders.
Meanwhile, President Trump's campaign announced that he had raised $125 million along with the Republican National Committee, exceeding the record he set in the previous quarter.
Trump and the RNC entered the fourth quarter with $156 million in cash on hand, campaign manager Brad Parscale announced Tuesday - highlighting the growing cash lead that Trump has over any potential Democratic rival.
The Democratic field has split up the donor base, which is giving to multiple candidates or not giving at all until donors see the primary field narrow.
Two other candidates released their figures Tuesday, providing a sense of how wide-ranging the fundraising totals were among Democratic candidates as they slogged through the notoriously difficult summer fundraising months.
South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, announced that his campaign raised more than $19.1 million in the third quarter - less than Sanders did but an amount that gives him staying power in a crowded field.
Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D- Calif.), announced raising $11.6 million - on par with her haul last quarter. Her campaign said she entered the fourth quarter with $10 million in cash on hand.
Sanders (I-Vt.) transferred an additional $2.6 million from his other federal campaign accounts, the campaign said.
The third-quarter figure announced by the Sanders campaign rivals his $26 million haul at this point in the primary campaign in 2015, when he stunned the Democratic field by nearly matching the total of his opponent, Hillary Clinton, with an infusion of money from donors giving less than $200. Yet this time, he is facing more than a dozen opponents.
The massive third-quarter haul is welcome news for Sanders supporters, who have seen their candidate fall behind former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in some recent polls. The Sanders campaign has also been dealing with staff turmoil in the key early states of Iowa and New Hampshire.
But Sanders's formidable fundraising email list, which has been without an equal in recent years, could help him weather those challenges into a crucial fall stretch.
The Sanders campaign offered a glimpse of where it is spending some of its cash, announcing its first paid TV commercial of the campaign Tuesday afternoon. The ad, which will begin a two-week run in Iowa on Thursday, is backed by $1.3 million for airtime, the campaign said.
""In this moment, we need a fighter - Bernie Sanders,"" says the narrator in a 60-second version of the commercial. The ad shows clips of Sanders speaking at campaign rallies, marching with workers and greeting supporters.
Buttigieg's reported third-quarter contributions were less than what his campaign raised in the second quarter - when he surpassed all of his Democratic opponents with $24.8 million. But they were far greater than his first-quarter total of $7.1 million.

His campaign has spent the past quarter aggressively building its operation and investing in early states, notably rolling out television ads in Iowa that seek to differentiate Buttigieg from Warren and Sanders when it comes to health care.
In addition, Buttigieg has more than doubled his staff members in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada over the past several months.
Harris saw a bump in fundraising and polling at the end of the second quarter thanks to a headline-grabbing debate performance in June, but she has struggled to maintain momentum and slipped in the polls.

Harris had a full fundraising schedule this summer to increase donations and sustain her campaign. She recently announced plans to expand her campaign in Iowa and South Carolina through November.
Candidates have until Oct. 15 to file fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission, but those with noteworthy numbers typically share their totals soon after a quarter ends. Monday was the final day of the third quarter, which began July 1.
While Sanders's support in the polls has fluctuated in his second run for president, his fundraising ability has been a reliable asset that has continued to stun some Democrats.
Campaign officials declined Tuesday to specify how much he had in cash on hand by the end of the quarter.

Their contributions can fuel campaigns for a longer period of time, because it takes longer for such donors to reach the $2,800 maximum they can donate to a primary campaign.
The Democratic nominee will eventually face off against Trump's successful small-dollar fundraising operation.
Sanders and Warren have opted not to host private fundraisers catering to wealthy donors.
Still, Sanders has supplemented his online fundraising with occasional in-person events his campaign has dubbed ""grass-roots fundraisers."" The gatherings, held in big cities such as San Francisco and New York, have featured far lower entry fees than the typical private fundraisers.
Democratic donors fueled campaigns and groups with a record-breaking amount of small-dollar donations on the last day of the third quarter, according to ActBlue, a Democratic fundraising platform.
ActBlue announced that on Monday, it had recorded the largest number of individual contributions in a day since its founding in 2004.
WinRed, the GOP platform for online donations, said Tuesday that it processed more than $13.7 million in donations from more than 276,000 contributors in the six days since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced the impeachment inquiry.

Top contenders for 2020 separated sharply by cost of their policy proposals
One side of the Democratic Party wants the nation's billionaires to pay a slightly higher tax rate on their income. Through an unprecedented wealth tax, the other side would target the stock holdings, real estate and other property of the nation's billionaires to raise trillions of dollars of new revenue.
One side has virtually no plans to have the government take over private industry. The other has an armada of proposals for federal interventions, including government control of U.S. health insurance, public production of prescription drugs and mandating worker control over their companies.
With Democrats set to debate again this week, the presidential primary campaign has revealed a sharp split in the party over core tenets of American capitalism.
The leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination have separated into two camps, with Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) leading a liberal flank in the polling and former vice president Joe Biden and Pete But tigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., leading the moderate side. 
The eventual nominee will determine the party's position on vital economic questions including the taxes paid by the richest Americans; the size of the federal welfare state; the makeup of the health-care industry; and the relationship between workers and corporations.
The gap is so large that Warren and Sanders would spend up to 10 times as much as Biden over the next 10 years and about eight times as much as Buttigieg. 
'At the heart of this primary is a debate over the future of American capitalism,' said Timothy Naftali, an associate professor of history at New York University.
'The Democratic Party is trying to come to terms with where it stands on the kinds of issues Warren and Sanders raise "" on the tax system, on debt and education, on the nature of how we deliver health care,' he said. 'These are big issues, and Sanders and Warren are on one side, and most of the other Democrats appear to be on the other.'
The jostling comes as President Trump and White House officials have seized on recent economic news to argue that their agenda of low taxes, reduced regulations and a shake-up in trade policy has helped push the stock market and labor market to record levels. The White House has tried to seize on the more liberal proposals emanating from the Democratic primary and accuse Trump's eventual rival of running on a platform of socialism.
'Sanders and Warren have aggressively pushed this pretty far-left agenda on the economy, and Biden has tried to run up the middle,' said Stephen Moore, a conservative at the Heritage Foundation who advises Trump. 'But at the end of the day, if you have a President Biden or a President Buttigieg with a Democratic Congress, you could get much higher taxes, a Green New Deal and a pretty aggressive step toward socialized medicine.'
Democrats say the recent strong economic data overlooks the deeper economic suffering confronting broad sections of the working class. But their solutions to that suffering are markedly different.
Adding up the cost of his various policy proposals, Sanders is calling for new federal spending that would amount to more than $50-trillion over the next decade "" a number about equal to one-fifth of the entire U.S. economy over that time. Warren, who has called herself a 'capitalist to my bones' but agrees with many of Sanders's policies, is proposing upward of $30-trillion of new spending. (Part of the difference between Warren and Sanders is her less costly estimate of what it would take to pay for expanding Medicare to all Americans. His climate, housing and student debt plans are also significantly bigger than hers.)
By contrast, Buttigieg is proposing about $6-trillion of new federal spending over the next decade, while Biden has laid out how he would pay for about $3-trillion of spending over that time.
Warren and Sanders have also pushed a wealth tax that could raise more than $4-trillion, taxing accumulated wealth and assets in a departure from the traditional Democratic policy of taxing income. Biden released a significantly less aggressive tax plan this month that would raise taxes on investors and firms, a plan much closer to the position of the Obama administration toward the end of its second term.
Some academics said the current division on economic policy between the Democratic Party's leading presidential candidates may be wider than that between Republican and Democratic presidential candidates in recent general elections.
Judging by their tax policies, for instance, Sanders and Biden are about 10 times further apart today than John McCain and Barack Obama were in the 2008 presidential campaign.
The last time a party faced such divergence may have been the 2016 GOP primary, when most Republican candidates pledged a conventional approach to fiscal conservatism "" including entitlement cuts and free trade "" while Trump promised to leave Medicare and Social Security untouched and criticized trade agreements.
The Democratic campaigns will continue to announce new economic policies. Biden's campaign, for example, is working on a trade policy aimed at seeking a contrast with Trump by highlighting the former vice president's experience working with countries worldwide, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the campaign's internal planning.
And Buttigieg aides are crafting a tax plan "" he is the only candidate in the top tier without one "" that probably would aim to tax the rich but not go as far as Sanders and Warren, two other people said.
These diverging approaches reflect not only differences in the value of specific policies, some experts say, but also illustrate philosophical questions about the degree to which American capitalism requires massive federal intervention.
A central part of the division includes disagreements over how to reform the welfare state, with Sanders and Warren pushing for universal programs such as a Medicare-for-all health-care system and tuition-free colleges and universities and Sanders also calling for eliminating all student debt.
Sanders has long pitched universal programs as generating greater political support and reducing administrative inefficiencies, while Buttigieg has criticized the liberals' plan for universal free college as benefiting 'the children of millionaires and billionaires.' Sanders responded this month by telling MSNBC: 'I'm very glad that Mr. Buttigieg is worried that I have been too easy on upper-income people and the millionaires and billionaires.'
The camps also differ in the extent to which they target certain powerful financial interests, with Warren and Sanders calling for significantly curbing the influence of actors such as Wall Street banks, the fossil fuel industry, private health insurance companies and the nation's approximately 750 billionaires.
Part of the split with the moderates emerges from a belief among those on the left that the harm created by these special interests cannot be mitigated if their clout and their influence over the political system are not significantly reduced.
'Both Warren and Sanders would make the Democratic Party a social-democratic one. It would really change the fundamental basis of the party,' said Dean Baker, a left-leaning economist who supports Warren and has called this primary campaign 'without a doubt' the starkest policy choice in Democrats' modern history.



Warren began her campaign with a proposal to create a government-run drug producer to bring down pharmaceutical prices. Sanders last week announced a plan to create publicly owned Internet providers and universal broadband access. Both liberals have called for giving workers some voting power over large corporations, although Sanders's proposal would apply to many more companies and also give workers a percentage of companies' stock holdings.
'Public ownership ideas have suddenly become core parts of the [Democratic] economic agenda,' said Peter Gowan, an economic expert at the Democracy Collaborative, a left-leaning think tank. 'We're not just talking about the welfare state now "" it's the welfare state plus plans to democratize the economy.'
To some of the moderates' defenders, their approach represents a more pragmatic attempt to address some of the economy's bigger challenges, quickly providing help to those who need it most rather than pursuing sweeping programs with little likelihood of being enacted in a divided political system.
Some also view the Sanders and Warren plans as inadvisable, either because they aim to raise taxes too steeply or would force Americans to give up their private health insurance.
'It's not just about being realistic; he just doesn't like the idea,' one Biden adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the campaign's thinking, said about the single-payer plan. 'We don't think you can raise $3-trillion a year in taxes. It's absurd.'
Biden and Buttigieg have also ridiculed the math of their opponents as overly optimistic and said the middle class would be hurt by the tax increases required in their large government expansions.
But they have also dismissed the idea that they are less concerned about the social crises in American life.

Or as Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), another moderate, put it at the last debate: 'I have bold ideas. . . . Just because they're different than Elizabeth's doesn't mean they're [not] bold.'
Still, there are signs that candidates are under pressure to make adjustments. Biden told CNBC this month that he would support a new financial-transaction tax on Wall Street. His comments came one day after his campaign released tax proposals that rejected the idea.
'If one side wins, it's economic disruption in advantage of the people, with the losers being billionaires and defense contractors,' said Alex Lawson, executive director of Social Security Works, a liberal group. 'And if the other side wins, it's less clear, but it probably looks basically similar to how it looks now "" but without Trump.'

Critics had questioned
 how Democrat would 
pay for Medicare-for-all
Sen. Elizabeth Warren rolled out a $20.5 trillion health-care plan on Friday that sought to put an exclamation point on a central argument of her candidacy: that a liberal revolutionary can also be electable.
Warren's plan, a version of the Medicare-for-all idea that has become a mantra for many on the Democratic Party's left, includes a raft of new taxes on businesses and the wealthy but, she insisted, would not be funded on the backs of middle-class Americans.
The announcement followed weeks of Warren's repeated refusal to say whether her plan would raise middle-class taxes, prompting criticism from rivals that the candidate known for her detailed proposals was afraid to concede the politically uncomfortable truth. The issue has been particularly awkward for Warren (Mass.), who has tried to overcome skepticism among some in the party who fear that her promise to radically restructure the American economy would alienate crucial swing-state voters.
On Friday, Warren appeared to try to thread the rhetorical needle. She vowed to spare most Americans from additional costs but positioned herself squarely on the side of embracing steep tax hikes - effectively daring President Trump, should she win the nomination, to brand her a tax-and-spend liberal.
""Health care is a human right, and we need a system that reflects our values. That system is Medicare-for-all,"" Warren wrote in a Medium post published Friday. ""A key step in winning the public debate over Medicare-for-all will be explaining what this plan costs - and how to pay for it.""
Centrist Democrats moved swiftly Friday to sound the alarm that Warren, who leads the pack in recent early-state polls and has amassed what many see as the most effective Democratic campaign operation, risks handing the Republicans a major advantage. 
Not only would Warren have to defend new taxes as part of her health plan - on top of roughly $5 trillion in new taxes she has already advocated to cover a range of other proposals - but she would be attempting to convince Americans to support virtually erasing more than 150 million private health insurance plans.
 ""The average Democrat in Ohio is going to say: 'Wait a minute, I mean, how do you do that? How do you do all of that? Free this and free that? How does that happen?' "" said Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), a moderate who recently dropped out of the presidential race. ""We just want to beat Trump. That's the revolution. Beating Trump.""
While not specifically commenting on Warren's plan, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) used a television interview Friday to point to the potential electoral dangers for Democrats of backing such a program in 2020.
 ""I'm not a big fan of Medicare-for-all,"" Pelosi told Bloomberg TV, adding: ""Hopefully, as we emerge into the election year, the mantra will be 'more health care for all Americans,' because there is a comfort level that some people have with their current private insurance.""
Others chided Warren for backing herself into a corner by supporting an idea proposed by her main liberal rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, the democratic socialist from Vermont, and then failing to consider how to fund it. Sanders has said that middle-class taxes would go up, though overall costs would go down.
Several other Democratic candidates back a ""public option,"" under which a Medicare-type plan would be available to everyone but would not be universal.
""She accepted Bernie Sanders's Medicare-for-all program and then had to reverse engineer how to pay for some of it. But it's not terribly persuasive,"" said Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.), another candidate for president. 
 Former vice president Joe Biden charged that Warren's cost estimates were off by trillions and there was no reasonable path to paying for such a sprawling health care overhaul.
""She's making it up. There is no way,"" Biden said in an interview with ""PBS NewsHour.""
Sanders remained silent on Warren's proposal Friday, and his campaign declined to comment on it. His reaction will be a key test for those on the left, signaling whether Warren has hewed closely enough to Sanders's ideas to win support from his voters if his campaign falters. 
Warren endured sustained attacks from her Democratic rivals during the last presidential debate, in large part because of her inability to explain how she'd pay for Medicare-for-all. It was shortly after that Oct. 15 faceoff that her staff ramped up efforts to come up with a funding blueprint.
""After the last debate she, she felt like, 'Okay, I'm going to dig in,' "" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.). Jayapal is the lead sponsor of the House version of the Medicare-for-all plan, and she has been having conversations with Warren about it for months. 
She praised Warren's efforts. ""It's just really clear that this is not a question of: Can we do it viably?"" Jayapal said. ""It's a question of: Do we have the political will to take on the entrenched interests?"" 
Republicans were quick to pounce, providing a preview of what a general election could look like should Warren be the nominee. The plan will ""hurt millions by eliminating their jobs and private health insurance while simultaneously bankrupting the country and hurting the quality of care,"" said Steve Guest, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee.
The Daily Caller, a conservative news outlet, posted a political cartoon depicting Warren's plan as a massive Trojan horse, one that looks appealing but contains ""crippling taxation."" 
Warren cited several experts in rolling out her plan, but others questioned its assumptions. Kenneth E. Thorpe, chairman of the health policy department at Emory University and an expert on Medicare-for-all, said Warren was significantly underestimating the costs. 
He said the cost in new federal spending would be $35 trillion over 10 years, about $15 trillion more than Warren's estimate. ""There's no way it's $20 trillion. I don't know why they'd put out that number,"" Thorpe said. ""The bottom line is, even with all the big numbers she's got in there, you're only getting 55, 60 percent of the way there.""
Warren did secure praise from key players on the left, a population she's actively courting. Ady Barkan, an influential health-care activist who met privately with Warren in California over the summer, lauded her plan as ""perhaps the greatest feat of public policy jujitsu that I have ever seen.""
Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser to Biden during the Obama administration, also praised the plan's deftness.
""Politically, health-care reform can be the Afghanistan of domestic policy. You can get completely bogged down there,"" he said, but Warren's detailed plan provides a way out of the trap.
""When you don't have an answer, you're just going to kind of flounder around, and at this point she can she can very much argue, 'Go read page 14 and appendix two, and then we'll talk,' "" he said.
The debate over health care is particularly resonant for Democrats because they say Republicans are vulnerable on the issue, due to their attempts to eliminate the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, which has grown increasingly popular. 
Warren's funding proposal mostly involves hitting corporations and the wealthy, including a provision that would require companies to send most of the funds they currently spend on employee health contributions to the federal government.
The plan also expands Warren's signature wealth tax proposal, so that people with a net worth above $1 billion would pay a 6 percent tax rather than the original 3 percent. (Those with a worth of less than $1 billion but more than $50 million would still pay 2 percent.)
The plan would also cut military spending, and it would take advantage of what Warren says would be significant savings from eliminating the labyrinthine bureaucracy of private insurance.
Warren contended her plan does not include a tax on the middle class, a position some disputed. Rather, she said, it will result in a $11 trillion tax cut for working Americans. ""Congratulations on the raise!"" Warren wrote in her Medium post.
The senator also said that in coming weeks she will roll out a transition plan, adding, ""Of course, moving to this kind of system will not be easy and will not happen overnight.""

New flashes of Democratic electoral strength Tuesday from the outskirts of Memphis, Cincinnati and Philadelphia to the neighborhoods of Northern Virginia marked a new advancement of the party's dominance across America's fast-changing suburbs.
The results underscored the profound electoral realignment that has been unfolding since President Trump's ascent upended the nation's political dynamics, marking the third time since his 2016 victory that Republicans lost ground in those communities while solidifying their hold on rural areas.
An apparent Democratic win Tuesday in Kentucky's gubernatorial race, as well as the Democratic takeover of the Virginia state legislature, left Republicans stumbling and increasingly uncertain about their own political fates.
""It was a rough night,"" said Scott Reed, the chief political strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ""There is a lot of positive news around President Trump's governing on the economy, on regulations and judges, and it seems to be overwhelmed by the drama.""
Sky-blue campaign signs in Delaware County, Pa., a historically Republican Philadelphia suburb where Democrats swept the ballot box, told the story of how even local council contests had been nationalized. 
""Had enough Trump? Flip Delco Nov. 5th,"" said the signs, which were stuck on roadsides and outside polling places.
""The state is flipping its political identity,"" said Larry Ceisler, a Democratic media consultant in Philadelphia. ""The suburbs that used to be moderate Republican suburbs, controlled by the GOP, are almost totally blue, going all the way down to seats on the school boards. Individuals did not matter.""
Many Republican candidates across the country, meanwhile, fell back on the polarizing campaign style that Trump has embraced, denouncing Democratic rivals as ""socialist"" and warning of illegal immigrant invasions, a strategy that, while spurned in the suburbs, helped them succeed in more rural places such as southwestern Pennsylvania, where Republicans made gains in local elected offices. 
Trump's rural strength helped him flip Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, traditionally Democratic states, to gain his electoral college victory. But since then, the losses in suburban areas have had far greater electoral impact, driving the nation's political shift since the 2016 election. As president, Trump has seen a 47-seat Republican advantage in the U.S. House become a 36-seat deficit, largely because of suburban defections. The number of Republican-held governorships has fallen from 33 to 26, and the percentage of state legislative seats controlled by the party has fallen from 57 to 52. 
""Republicans aren't leaning in on the issues that affect suburban, affluent voters like gun safety and the environment,"" said former congressman Ryan Costello (R), who retired from his Chester County, Pa., seat in 2018 rather than face reelection. ""Plus, Trump is not a benefit but a burden. That forces Republicans to have to ask voters to really hear them out on issues like taxes and school safety even if those voters don't like Trump and that's not easy.""
Trump is showing no sign of shifting his approach, and his campaign, always wary of broadcasting weakness, defiantly made the case of Trump's strength as Tuesday's Republican setbacks became apparent. 
Over three tweets or retweets in one hour on Tuesday night, Trump claimed that Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin had been down ""at least 15 points,"" ""17 points"" and ""maybe 20!"" before he visited the state on Monday for a rally. 
A mid-October poll by Mason-Dixon found the race tied, 46 percent to 46 percent. Bevin, who has refused to concede defeat and called for a recanvassing of ballots, was trailing by less than a single percentage point Wednesday morning. 
Trump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, dismissed the journalistic analysis of Bevin's Democratic rival, Andy Beshear, the son of a former governor who declared victory, as ""full of crap.""
""The Democrats nominated a moderate, who's dad was a moderate, who didn't talk about impeachment or Trump, and who acts like a Republican,"" Parscale wrote. ""Talk about Kentucky when an actual Democrat runs.""
But county-level results in the state showed that regardless of Beshear's strengths and Bevin's weakness, suburban areas, particularly outside of Cincinnati, underperformed historical trends for Republicans. 
The same shift was also evident in Mississippi, where Republican Tate Reeves easily won the governorship. Outside Memphis, Reeves carried 61 percent of the vote, compared with four years ago when the Republican candidate for governor won 80 percent of the vote, according to an analysis by Inside Elections. In Madison County, Miss., which includes tony suburbs of Jackson, the Republican vote margin in the gubernatorial race fell from 69 percent to 49 percent.
The same problems continue to roil Republican politics in other states. Texas House Speaker Dennis Bonnen (R) recently announced he would step aside after he was caught on tape admitting to concerns about Trump's weakness. ""With all due respect to Trump, who I love by the way - he's killing us in the urban-suburban districts,"" Bonnen said in the recording, according to a transcript.
Trump's campaign hopes those shifts will not prove decisive in 2020, when Trump's reelection will depend on his success in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania, where there are large rural and non-college-educated populations to offset suburban voters.
Republicans also are hoping for help in 2020 from the Democratic nominee for president, given the liberal tilt of high-polling candidates such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who are calling for a Medicare-for-all plan that would replace the current health insurance system.
""We need good candidates who run good campaigns who can speak to college-educated voters,"" said Corry Bliss, a Republican strategist, who ran a super PAC for House candidates in 2018. ""Thankfully for us, the only other party in American politics is the Democratic Party, and their front-runner just released a proposal that will cost $30 trillion and eliminate private health insurance."" 
A Washington Post-ABC News poll released last week found sharp differences in views of Trump between college-educated voters and those who did not get a college degree. About 6 in 10 college graduates strongly disapprove of Trump's job performance, compared with 42 percent of those without college degrees. 
The divide is also sharp when it comes to the underlying facts driving the impeachment investigation now targeting Trump. While 64 percent of college graduates said Trump had done something wrong in his dealings with Ukraine, half of those without degrees said the same thing, according to the poll. 
Of next year's likely swing states, Pennsylvania may provide the most significant challenge to Trump, given the large suburban voting pools within commuting distance of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. 
""GOP should be most concerned about what happened in local elections in Chester, Delaware and Bucks County, PA,"" tweeted Josh Holmes, a confidant of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). ""That is genuinely alarming if you know the voting history.""
Trump's campaign and White House staff have launched fitful efforts to reach out to suburban voters around issues including prescription drugs, student loans and teenage e-cigarette usage. They also hope to drive turnout among more rural parts of the state.
""Trump's base is rural and small-town Pennsylvania, white working-class voters whose ancestors worked in the mines and in the mills,"" said G. Terry Madonna, a political science professor at Franklin and Marshall College. ""The real fear that the Republicans have is that if the suburbs are the most populous areas and if this trend continues, the problems could worsen.""
Democratic strategists, as they did in 2018, coached candidates to focus on messages about health care and other pocketbook matters, with issues such as Medicaid expansion bolstering Beshear in Kentucky and playing a central role in Democratic victories in Virginia.

Critics had questioned
 how Democrat would 
pay for Medicare-for-all
Sen. Elizabeth Warren rolled out a $20.5 trillion health-care plan on Friday that sought to put an exclamation point on a central argument of her candidacy: that a liberal revolutionary can also be electable.
Warren's plan, a version of the Medicare-for-all idea that has become a mantra for many on the Democratic Party's left, includes a raft of new taxes on businesses and the wealthy but, she insisted, would not be funded on the backs of middle-class Americans.
The announcement followed weeks of Warren's repeated refusal to say whether her plan would raise middle-class taxes, prompting criticism from rivals that the candidate known for her detailed proposals was afraid to concede the politically uncomfortable truth. The issue has been particularly awkward for Warren (Mass.), who has tried to overcome skepticism among some in the party who fear that her promise to radically restructure the American economy would alienate crucial swing-state voters.
On Friday, Warren appeared to try to thread the rhetorical needle. She vowed to spare most Americans from additional costs but positioned herself squarely on the side of embracing steep tax hikes - effectively daring President Trump, should she win the nomination, to brand her a tax-and-spend liberal.
""Health care is a human right, and we need a system that reflects our values. That system is Medicare-for-all,"" Warren wrote in a Medium post published Friday. ""A key step in winning the public debate over Medicare-for-all will be explaining what this plan costs - and how to pay for it.""
Centrist Democrats moved swiftly Friday to sound the alarm that Warren, who leads the pack in recent early-state polls and has amassed what many see as the most effective Democratic campaign operation, risks handing the Republicans a major advantage. 
Not only would Warren have to defend new taxes as part of her health plan - on top of roughly $5 trillion in new taxes she has already advocated to cover a range of other proposals - but she would be attempting to convince Americans to support virtually erasing more than 150 million private health insurance plans.
 ""The average Democrat in Ohio is going to say: 'Wait a minute, I mean, how do you do that? How do you do all of that? Free this and free that? How does that happen?' "" said Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), a moderate who recently dropped out of the presidential race. ""We just want to beat Trump. That's the revolution. Beating Trump.""
While not specifically commenting on Warren's plan, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) used a television interview Friday to point to the potential electoral dangers for Democrats of backing such a program in 2020.
 ""I'm not a big fan of Medicare-for-all,"" Pelosi told Bloomberg TV, adding: ""Hopefully, as we emerge into the election year, the mantra will be 'more health care for all Americans,' because there is a comfort level that some people have with their current private insurance.""
Others chided Warren for backing herself into a corner by supporting an idea proposed by her main liberal rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, the democratic socialist from Vermont, and then failing to consider how to fund it. Sanders has said that middle-class taxes would go up, though overall costs would go down.
Several other Democratic candidates back a ""public option,"" under which a Medicare-type plan would be available to everyone but would not be universal.
""She accepted Bernie Sanders's Medicare-for-all program and then had to reverse engineer how to pay for some of it. But it's not terribly persuasive,"" said Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.), another candidate for president. 
 Former vice president Joe Biden charged that Warren's cost estimates were off by trillions and there was no reasonable path to paying for such a sprawling health care overhaul.
""She's making it up. There is no way,"" Biden said in an interview with ""PBS NewsHour.""
Sanders remained silent on Warren's proposal Friday, and his campaign declined to comment on it. His reaction will be a key test for those on the left, signaling whether Warren has hewed closely enough to Sanders's ideas to win support from his voters if his campaign falters. 
Warren endured sustained attacks from her Democratic rivals during the last presidential debate, in large part because of her inability to explain how she'd pay for Medicare-for-all. It was shortly after that Oct. 15 faceoff that her staff ramped up efforts to come up with a funding blueprint.
""After the last debate she, she felt like, 'Okay, I'm going to dig in,' "" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.). Jayapal is the lead sponsor of the House version of the Medicare-for-all plan, and she has been having conversations with Warren about it for months. 
She praised Warren's efforts. ""It's just really clear that this is not a question of: Can we do it viably?"" Jayapal said. ""It's a question of: Do we have the political will to take on the entrenched interests?"" 
Republicans were quick to pounce, providing a preview of what a general election could look like should Warren be the nominee. The plan will ""hurt millions by eliminating their jobs and private health insurance while simultaneously bankrupting the country and hurting the quality of care,"" said Steve Guest, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee.
The Daily Caller, a conservative news outlet, posted a political cartoon depicting Warren's plan as a massive Trojan horse, one that looks appealing but contains ""crippling taxation."" 
Warren cited several experts in rolling out her plan, but others questioned its assumptions. Kenneth E. Thorpe, chairman of the health policy department at Emory University and an expert on Medicare-for-all, said Warren was significantly underestimating the costs. 
He said the cost in new federal spending would be $35 trillion over 10 years, about $15 trillion more than Warren's estimate. ""There's no way it's $20 trillion. I don't know why they'd put out that number,"" Thorpe said. ""The bottom line is, even with all the big numbers she's got in there, you're only getting 55, 60 percent of the way there.""
Warren did secure praise from key players on the left, a population she's actively courting. Ady Barkan, an influential health-care activist who met privately with Warren in California over the summer, lauded her plan as ""perhaps the greatest feat of public policy jujitsu that I have ever seen.""
Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser to Biden during the Obama administration, also praised the plan's deftness.
""Politically, health-care reform can be the Afghanistan of domestic policy. You can get completely bogged down there,"" he said, but Warren's detailed plan provides a way out of the trap.
""When you don't have an answer, you're just going to kind of flounder around, and at this point she can she can very much argue, 'Go read page 14 and appendix two, and then we'll talk,' "" he said.
The debate over health care is particularly resonant for Democrats because they say Republicans are vulnerable on the issue, due to their attempts to eliminate the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, which has grown increasingly popular. 
Warren's funding proposal mostly involves hitting corporations and the wealthy, including a provision that would require companies to send most of the funds they currently spend on employee health contributions to the federal government.
The plan also expands Warren's signature wealth tax proposal, so that people with a net worth above $1 billion would pay a 6 percent tax rather than the original 3 percent. (Those with a worth of less than $1 billion but more than $50 million would still pay 2 percent.)
The plan would also cut military spending, and it would take advantage of what Warren says would be significant savings from eliminating the labyrinthine bureaucracy of private insurance.
Warren contended her plan does not include a tax on the middle class, a position some disputed. Rather, she said, it will result in a $11 trillion tax cut for working Americans. ""Congratulations on the raise!"" Warren wrote in her Medium post.
The senator also said that in coming weeks she will roll out a transition plan, adding, ""Of course, moving to this kind of system will not be easy and will not happen overnight.""

The British electorate delivered another surprise Thursday, and the shock waves from the victory for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party are being felt far beyond the United Kingdom. Though the analogies are imperfect, what happened there has implications elsewhere, including the United States as it heads toward the election of 2020.
The vote showed the widening gap between urban and nonurban areas of Britain and the reshaping of the party coalitions "" a pattern that is familiar in the United States in the era of President Trump. The results underscored, in a related way, the disdain many of those nonurban voters have for the elites as well as the power of a nationalist message, something else that has affected American politics.
The rout suffered by the Labour Party and its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, also provided a clear warning of the limits of a left-wing agenda, though Corbyn is more left wing than any of the Democrats running for U.S. president and was saddled with stains of anti-Semitism. Nonetheless, Labour's defeat "" its fourth election loss in a row and its worst performance since 1935 "" could influence the thinking of many Democratic U.S. voters as they pick a nominee next year.
Johnson started off badly, with one of the worst opening acts of any modern British prime minister, losing big votes in Parliament and seemingly stumbling toward disaster and a possible early ouster. But the wily Johnson did what his two Conservative predecessors failed to do and emerged Friday morning with the biggest Tory victory since 1987 and the days of Margaret Thatcher.

His predecessors in 10 Downing Street, David Cameron and Theresa May, both made huge political bets and lost. Cameron called the Brexit referendum in 2016, fully expecting that voters would support remaining in the European Union and hoping that would dampen the long-standing divisions in his party over Europe. When the opposite happened, he stepped down immediately.
Cameron was succeeded by May, whose political skills were no match for the challenge she had been handed by Cameron. As she wrestled with opposition at home to her negotiations with the E.U., she made a fateful decision by calling a snap election in 2017. She hoped the election would add to her narrow parliamentary majority. Instead, the election cost her that majority. She never fully recovered, eventually stepping down because of the impasse over Brexit and her inability to maneuver through.

Johnson made an equally bold bet and won handsomely. Faced with the impasse over the terms of fulfilling the vote to leave the E.U., he, too, called for an election. When Corbyn and Labour finally agreed to that, the die was cast. British voters faced a choice familiar to Americans in 2016, picking between two unpopular leaders of the major parties.
The Tories began the election with a solid lead, but late polls showed the gap between Conservatives and Labour narrowing, which only added to the drama when the exit polls posted as the polls closed showed Johnson's party headed toward a huge victory.
British politics in the Brexit era have become more complex because of the way the issue has scrambled coalitions. There is a traditional left-right division "" Conservatives vs. Labour "" but there is also a Brexit division that has split the coalitions of both major parties. Through the past few years, Brexit did more to bedevil the Conservative Party, which was torn between those strongly in favor of leaving the E.U. even without an agreement and those wary of taking that step.
On Thursday, Brexit bit into the Labour coalition and bit hard. The Labour Party suffered devastation in working-class areas of the country outside of London, areas that had been voting for the party for generations. Among those that went from Labour to Conservative was the mining district once represented in Parliament by Tony Blair, a former prime minister.
These were districts where voters had supported the Brexit referendum, and these voters finally showed their frustrations by giving Johnson a handsome majority and the power now to begin the initial step of taking Britain out of the E.U. and into an uncertain future.
A similar thing has been happening in this country as party coalitions undergo changes. Although Democrats have long claimed to be the party of the white working class, that's hardly the case anymore. For many years, working-class whites have been moving toward the Republican Party, and under Trump that movement has accelerated. That's the conundrum facing Democrats as they think about how to assemble an electoral college majority in 2020.

The exhaustion factor may have contributed to the results in those areas in Britain that abandoned Labour for the Conservative Party. After nearly four years of wrangling over how to exit the E.U., many voters may have decided that only by giving Johnson a freer hand could the country get past this gridlock in Parliament, whatever the consequences.
In the United States, the exhaustion factor could cut differently "" exhaustion caused by the volatility and chaos sewn constantly by Trump. Democrats are hoping that will help motivate voters on the fence to back their nominee and limit Trump's presidency to a single term.
But there could be more to what happened in Britain than simply a fatigue with Brexit. The swings could be related to Brexit, but some party leaders might be refusing to acknowledge reality. The defections also could reflect fears that the Labour Party no longer truly represents the interests of people living in outlying areas of Britain, that the cultural disaffection of those voters "" who have suffered long-term economic decline "" has led to a new voting pattern.
Corbyn is a special case, given his long history and record. But only a few years ago, when Labour did better than expected in the election, he was seen as a possible, if still implausible, prime minister. On Thursday, the roof caved in on him. He said he would not stand for another election as party leader.
Some veterans of Labour politics think the vote reflected Corbyn more than Brexit, sensing that Corbyn and his tight band of supporters repelled voters and cost the party enormously. The Labour Party now faces a period of bloodletting and internal turmoil over the way toward a post-Corbyn party.

That will pit Labour's left against the center, a more virulent strain of the debate already underway in America's Democratic Party. Some people have suggested that Corbyn's defeat is a warning to Democrats that Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) or Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) could deliver the same fate if they become the party's nominee. Neither carries the baggage that Corbyn was carrying, but the British election will add to the pressures on those two candidates to dissuade voters that they would be too risky in facing Trump in a general election.
It cannot be overstated that Brexit is its own case and has paralyzed British politics since the referendum, but there are perils in suggesting it has no relevance to politics elsewhere. The urge to leave the E.U. is in part a reflection of the nationalist strain that exists elsewhere. In the United States, Trump has given it a name: 'America First.' His base has responded to that message, and he is counting on it as a motivating factor in November.
Johnson began this election in better shape than Trump is in as he looks to next year, despite the prime minister's own unpopularity and limitations. Still, Johnson's ability to produce sizable margins in so many of the nonurban districts stands as a possible template for the Trump campaign.
Whether the president has reached the upper limit of turnout in his strongest voting blocs or has more votes to pull is unanswerable today, though his campaign clearly believes there are more to gain. Democrats can't assume that won't happen.
The results in Britain are likely to intensify the debate among Democrats over both the party's agenda and its path to victory. Can Democrats really win back working-class voters, and, if so, how? Or should they bank on returns from the 2018 midterms and subsequent elections that have shown the power of the suburban vote as a foundation of the party's emerging coalition?
Reading too much into what happened Thursday in Britain is risky. But so, too, is dismissing those results as of no relevance to politics here.

The fourth Democratic debate is over, after 12 candidates jousted for three long hours. 
Below, your winners and losers (and two in-betweeners). 
Winners

Elizabeth Warren, the front-runner: For the first time in one of these debates, Warren found herself under sustained attack. Through a combination of debate format, Joe Biden's leads in early polls and Warren's unique political Teflon, she somehow avoided it. That changed Tuesday, though. Warren was the focal point, with the other candidates all but completely taking their focus off Biden. It wasn't completely smooth sailing for Warren (which we will get to), but it was an affirmation that she is viewed as perhaps the front-runner now.

Bernie Sanders: In his first debate after suffering a heart attack, he seemed to be more lively than he has been at any previous debate. He was also witty, joking with Biden after the former vice president gestured at him while talking about Vladimir Putin. ""Are you suggesting I'm Vladimir Putin?"" Sanders asked jokingly before the two men hugged. At another point, Cory Booker noted Sanders supports medical marijuana, and Sanders responded, ""But I'm not on it tonight."" Sanders has been accused of being humorless and a little dry - even overly angry - sometimes. He also has a perception issue thanks to his health problem. Fighting that off was the most important thing he could do Tuesday.

Amy Klobuchar: The Minnesota senator arguably made herself Warren's chief foil in this debate, creating contrasts on taxes, Medicare-for-all and other issues. At one point, she rejected the charge that she was creating a Republican talking point by pressing Warren on whether her Medicare-for-all proposal would raise taxes on the middle class. ""You are making Republican talking points right here in this room"" by talking about getting rid of private insurance, Klobuchar charged. And she was not wrong. All of this said, being the attacker in these debates has not always meant much. But Klobuchar needs to try something, especially since she is fighting to make the fifth debate; we shall see if voters are buying it. (One piece of advice, on behalf of all of Klobuchar's fellow Minnesotans: The bad jokes need to stop.)

Millennials: There was a point in the middle of the debate when South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii) had an impassioned debate about whether the United States should be in Syria. Gabbard was the most noninterventionist candidate on the stage, while Buttigieg said Syria was perhaps the one place in the Middle East where we need a presence. That disagreement aside, this was two millennial veterans of Middle East wars - the only two combat veterans among the leading candidates - having that debate on a presidential stage. That is quite a moment.

Andrew Yang: He makes this list solely because some of his top issues - automation and universal basic income - got a real debate. Candidates shared his concerns about the impact of automation on jobs, to some degree, and some on the stage, including Castro and Gabbard, were open to his idea to give every American $1,000 per month.

Losers

Biden: Not only does he seem to no longer be the candidate his opponents fear most, but he was again somewhat off his game. He offered some odd figures on the middle-class costs of Medicare-for-all. He said ""expidentially"" instead of ""exponentially."" He mixed up Iraq with Afghanistan. He said he never discussed his son's Ukraine dealings with him, even though his son has said differently. Biden hasn't really dropped in the polls as Warren has risen, but he is not showing the sharper version of himself that he probably needs to.

Booker's gripe about Biden's question: We get it: There is no safer applause line than attacking the refs, and Democrats are angry about how 2016 was handled by the media. But some of the complaints about moderators' questions on Tuesday didn't really make sense. Cory Booker took up the mantle we knew someone would when he attacked a question Biden faced about his son Hunter's overseas work. He called it ""deja vu all over again"" from the 2016 election and accused the moderators of ""elevating a lie and attacking a statesman."" Except that question was fair. Anderson Cooper rightly noted that the major accusations President Trump has lodged against the Bidens are unsubstantiated - twice. Cooper also asked a very fair question about why Hunter Biden is ruling out working overseas if his dad becomes president, when they say there was nothing wrong with him doing it when his dad was vice president. Calling that ""attacking a statesman"" was melodramatic.

Biden's answer to that question: Biden was asked that question twice, and he said three times, ""My son's statement speaks for itself,"" which isn't really an answer. He added the second time, ""My son made a judgment. I'm proud of the judgment he made."" It is okay to point out Trump's allegations are baseless while acknowledging Hunter Biden's overseas work perhaps was not a great idea - which his new pledge tacitly seems to acknowledge.

The question Warren will not answer: Warren was given four chances to answer the question she has refused to directly answer: whether her Medicare-for-all proposal would increase taxes on the middle class. The fact that she passed each time was not surprising; she instead focuses on total costs going down for the middle class, including health-care costs - but she did get pushback from across the stage, including from Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Beto O'Rourke and even gently from Sanders, who again forthrightly admitted taxes would go up under his plan.

Tom Steyer: The debutante on the stage on Tuesday, he began by initially ignoring the question about impeachment (his pet issue) and saying that ""everyone here is more decent and more patriotic than the criminal in the White House."" He then waited for applause, which was slow to come and tepid. There are no second chances at first impressions, and Steyer - a billionaire whom Democrats have accused of buying his way on to the debate stage - didn't do anything in the debate to overcome that.
In between

Warren's answer on the Middle East: Warren at one point said, ""I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East. But we have to do it the right way, the smart way."" The question was about Syria, but that is a very broad statement. She'll need to expound. Expect to hear more on this.

Buttigieg: We have repeatedly had him in the winner category, even as he hasn't really risen in the polls. On Tuesday, as in other debates, he was sharp and came prepared, but this time he was more combative. Some thought he was amazing; others thought he was grating. I actually come down somewhere in the middle.

Democrats must address impeachment while still wooing voters on issuesThe eruption of impeachment proceedings against President Trump has thrown the Democratic presidential campaign abruptly off track, as the candidates scramble to respond forcefully on the scandal while simultaneously focusing on the bread-and-butter policies they have touted for months. 
The unusual split messaging pushes the primary into complicated terrain just four months before the first nominating contest in Iowa. While the candidates are vying for the chance to unseat Trump in 2020, Democratic leaders in Congress have initiated an inquiry focusing on a different question entirely: whether to remove him from office before then.
The response has sometimes been awkward. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) recently delivered impassioned remarks on unions but tacked on a statement about impeachment beforehand after consulting with aides. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) fielded questions about Medicare-for-all at a town hall last week, then faced inquiries from reporters on impeachment. Former vice president Joe Biden spent a few minutes discussing impeachment at a recent stop before turning to an abbreviated version of his usual speech.
""It definitely throws a monkey wrench into everybody's talking points,"" said Rep. Matthew Cartwright (D-Pa.), who supports Biden and endorsed an impeachment inquiry for the first time last week. ""It's something extra that they have to talk about.""
 While leading Democrats increasingly demand forceful statements on Trump's actions, many voters and activists are urging candidates not to stop talking about how they would provide health insurance to more Americans, shrink the gap between rich and poor, and combat climate change. Some bluntly warn that devoting too much attention to impeachment could be a costly mistake. 
""Impeachment is an afterthought for a lot of people,"" said Elesha Gayman, chair of the Scott County Democratic Party in Iowa. ""I appreciate them coming out with a statement, but that's about where it needs to end. I think the most important thing to carry forward for the Democrats is going to be having a message and a vision for what they are going to bring to the table.""
She added: ""I think, especially in the Democratic Party, we lose elections when we make it about 'we're better than the other guy' and we don't lay out a vision.""
What's clear is that the furor in Washington injects another huge dose of uncertainty, at a critical moment, into a contest that was already highly fluid. The field is likely to winnow soon, and the impeachment focus threatens to take even more oxygen from hopefuls who already had limited time to make an impact.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) took the rare step of beginning impeachment proceedings against Trump last week after he acknowledged urging the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Many Democrats say dislodging Trump from office is unlikely, given the strong support for him in the Republican-controlled Senate, where a two-thirds vote is needed for removal. 
Nevertheless, the Democratic presidential field has largely lined up behind Pelosi, endorsing her inquiry and vocally condemning Trump's conduct. A whistleblower complaint at the center of the controversy alleges that Trump misused his office for personal gain and that unidentified White House officials took improper actions to keep it a secret. Trump has said he did nothing wrong. 
 
Some voters expressed concerns about the Democrats forging ahead on impeachment. Diana Kroeger, 52, an independent from Hollis, N.H., who stood in line for a photo with Warren after her Friday town hall event there, said ""I'm worried"" about the process, fearing it will further divide the country. 
Will Norona, an autoworker from Flint, Mich., who walked a picket line in front of a GM plant in Detroit last week with Sanders, said he worried that focusing on impeachment could take attention away from other issues.
""Our focus is on this,"" said Norona, 43, speaking of the autoworkers' strike. 
But other Democrats, believing Trump to be increasingly vulnerable, want to see the candidates call him out more aggressively than ever.
""They've got to keep the focus on Trump while hot lights are on him,"" said Gilda Cobb-Hunter, president of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators and a veteran South Carolina Democrat.
Shawana Love, 42, an undecided voter who also joined the picket line in Detroit, said seeing the Democrats take steps toward impeaching Trump gets her more excited about the election. ""Impeach his a--!"" Love said.

The fast-moving developments and clashing voter sentiments are prompting many of the candidates to dedicate valuable time at campaign events - and devote space on their social media pages - to responding to the latest Trump news with outrage.
But they are taking different tacks.
Warren has been pointing out that she advocated impeachment proceedings long before the recent revelations about Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president. Warren has been rising in the polls, and some of her rivals have begun criticizing her policies, but the impeachment furor could make that harder with so much attention focused on Trump.
""The way to hold this president of the United States accountable is to impeach him,"" Warren told reporters after Friday's town hall. ""So I hope we go forward with care and deliberation, but that we do it quickly. I think it's important. The American people are counting on us.""
Some Warren allies say she is well-suited to talk about the issue because it is in line with one of her core campaign themes - tackling corruption. 
""For Elizabeth Warren, it's right in the middle of the bull's eye,"" said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren. ""Assuming this keeps going, I would be surprised if she didn't integrate it more and more into her stump speech.""
Still, the current landscape presents the paradox that if Trump were to be removed - a remote prospect at the moment - the Democratic nominee would presumably be running against Vice President Pence, not the figure they've been railing against for months.
Sanders has been more cautious about the prospect of impeachment. While he also supports an inquiry, a point he has emphasized repeatedly in recent days, he has long focused on policy, and he warned Democrats not to abandon work on other important issues. 
""The Congress of the United States must show the American people that it can walk and chew gum at the same time,"" Sanders said last week in Davenport, Iowa.
Warren, Sanders and the four other senators in the race have to keep another variable in mind: They would effectively become jurors in a Senate trial if the House votes to impeach Trump and Senate leaders move ahead with a judicial proceeding.
""Let's have that trial in the United States Senate,"" Sanders said in Plymouth, N.H., on Sunday. ""I will do my best to look at the facts as objectively as I can.""
Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D- Calif.) has sought to use the impeachment inquiry to remind voters of her experience as a prosecutor and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Harris canceled a recent fundraiser in Los Angeles to fly back to Washington for a meeting of the Senate Intelligence Committee, to which she also belongs.
Biden is tethered to the situation more directly than any other candidate. During a July 25 phone call, Trump requested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky investigate Biden, according to a rough transcript of the conversation that the White House released. Biden's son Hunter had served on the board of Burisma, Ukraine's largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power. Hunter Biden was not accused of wrongdoing. 
As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who many Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.
Despite the centrality of his role, Biden has been more reticent than some of his rivals when it comes to impeachment. 
At a recent fundraiser in Southern California, Biden said he and his family had done nothing wrong and accused Trump of trying to ""hijack an election so we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives."" He added, ""This is not about me."" 
Rufus Gifford, a former ambassador to Denmark who has donated to Biden and other candidates this year, said he sees both opportunity and peril for the former vice president. 
""It's very much a double-edged sword. On one hand, anyone kind of wants to be mano a mano with Trump right now,"" said Gifford, who was finance director for Barack Obama's 2012 campaign. At the same time, Gifford said, it could prompt some Democrats to question whether the Ukraine situation would be a vulnerability for Biden - chipping away at his assertion that he's the most electable Democrat - and ""those questions have to be answered.""
In the meantime, the drama set to unfold in coming weeks - likely to feature explosive congressional hearings, angry partisan debates, bitterly contested votes on the House floor and possibly further revelations about Trump - adds a daunting, unpredictable dynamic that, even more than the campaign so far, is outside the candidates' control.

As South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said recently, ""Nobody knows what the political consequences of impeachment are.""

Anti-environmentalism message sets up a key contrast with Democrats

PALM BEACH, Fla. "" While Democratic presidential candidates have called for sweeping measures to eliminate the U.S. carbon footprint, President Trump is promising voters a world free of the everyday inconveniences associated with combating climate change "" rolling back lightbulb regulations, ordering a study on low-flow toilets and turning bans on plastic straws into a campaign rallying cry.
The contrast is shaping up to be a key theme of the 2020 presidential race as Trump bets that his pitch to a bygone era will sway voters turned off by calls from some Democrats on the left for a transformative Green New Deal.
Democrats respond by arguing that the president's comments on climate "" which are often false and frequently veer into the
bizarre "" are out of step with science and modern-day voters who want to protect the planet.
 Trump's anti-environmentalism message was encapsulated in a weekend speech to a conservative group in South Florida that included a diatribe against wind-powered turbines "" arguing that building them produces 'a tremendous amount of fumes' and that the 'windmills,' as he calls them, are noisy, unattractive and kill too many birds.
 'I've seen the most beautiful fields, farms, fields "" most gorgeous things you've ever seen, and then you have these ugly things going up,' he said of the wind turbines. 'And you know what they don't tell you about windmills? After 10 years, they look like hell.'
The broad nostalgia encapsulated in Trump's 'Make America Great Again' slogan has become increasingly specific as he has zeroed in on consumer issues such as energy-efficient appliances, carbon-reducing fuel standards and plastic straw bans. Often operating from his own feelings rather than scientific evidence, the president has castigated Democrats' environmental agenda as unworkable and counterproductive.
 Trump has made the same nostalgic appeal on other issues "" ranging from his mocking of the #MeToo movement to his unfounded claim that his election allowed people to say 'Merry Christmas' again. But when it comes to energy-related issues, the regulatory moves of Trump's administration have easily merged with his campaign messaging.
On Friday, the Energy Department announced it would keep incandescent and halogen bulbs on the market rather than phasing them out on Jan.-1. The reprieve for old-fashioned lightbulbs affects roughly 3 billion "" nearly half "" of the bulbs in sockets in U.S. homes.
'If you like your lightbulbs, you can keep your lightbulbs!' the official White House Twitter account posted Saturday. 'The Obama Admin tried to limit Americans to buying more-expensive LED bulbs for their homes "" but thanks to President @realDonaldTrump, go ahead and decorate your house with whatever lights you want.'
Trump has said he wants to campaign heavily against the liberal Green New Deal proposal, pledging to 'rip that sucker' just two months before the election. Most of the Democratic presidential candidates do not support the most ambitious version of the Green New Deal plan, which lost momentum after the concept was introduced by a small group of lawmakers earlier this year.
 By focusing on convenience issues such as cheaper lightbulbs and plastic straws "" which the Trump campaign began selling this summer to protest bans in some cities "" the president is appealing directly to a segment of voters who say they want government to leave them alone, said Doug Heye, a Republican strategist and former spokesman for the Republican National Committee.
 'For his base, especially, it hits on something that's tangible, that's tactile and that voters like,' he said. 'It also hits on those broad themes of freedom and liberty and government encroachment on people's daily lives.'
Democrats and environmental activists have said Trump is selling out the long-term health of the planet in an attempt to secure short-term political gain. Trump's lightbulb decision, for example, will boost energy costs by $14-billion a year and generate 38-million tons of carbon dioxide annually, according to consumer group estimates.
While the White House criticized the Obama administration for the previous lightbulb regulation, saving energy used by lightbulbs was a goal Congress set in 2007 when it adopted bipartisan legislation later signed by President George W. Bush.-
During the Obama administration, conservatives made the lightbulb standards a rallying point for complaints about government interference "" and Trump has channeled those complaints from the Oval Office.
'The Trump administration's repeated attacks defy the common-sense, bipartisan support that energy efficiency has long enjoyed,' said Steve Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. 'They will cost consumers and businesses money, create uncertainty for businesses as rollbacks are contested in courts, add to harmful pollution, and undermine our efforts to address the climate crisis.'
At the Democratic presidential debate last week, several candidates described climate change as an existential threat to the planet, pledging to make it a top priority if elected. Several criticized Trump for not focusing enough on combating global warming.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has used his presidential campaign to mock Trump's comments about wind turbines, often sarcastically referring to him as a 'great' or 'profound' scientist for his unfounded claims linking wind energy to cancer. Sanders has also labeled Trump an 'idiot' for calling climate change a 'hoax.'
Trump's defenders point to his economic record and say the president's focus on reducing regulations has helped spur job growth without harming the quality of the nation's air or water.
'Unlike the previous administration, President Trump believes you can grow the economy and protect the environment,' White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement. 'While eliminating harmful and unnecessary regulations, this President has unleashed the American economy, provided greater regulatory certainty, achieved energy independence, and continued to safeguard the water supply and improve air quality.'
 While the administration has spent three years working to roll back nearly 100 federal rules governing energy and the environment, Trump has taken a particular interest in those affecting the coal industry, the auto sector and appliances, according to several top administration officials.
 The administration is also working to scale back national gas-mileage standards, even though several major automakers have pledged to meet the more ambitious targets established under Barack Obama. Early next year, the Transportation Department and the Environmental Protection Agency are expected to finalize a rule that would increase mileage targets for cars and light trucks each year by between 1 and 1.5 miles per gallon through 2026.
 Trump has said the rollback will help bolster America's auto industry. He has criticized car manufacturers who have agreed to meet tighter standards adopted by California and more than a dozen other states as 'foolish' and 'politically correct.'
Without evidence, Trump has claimed that electric vehicles and more fuel-efficient cars are less safe and less smooth-running than traditional vehicles. In fact, EPA experts have privately warned that the administration's rollback could lead to a small uptick in highway deaths.
 In a tweet in August, Trump said that 'Henry Ford would be very disappointed if he saw his modern-day descendants wanting to build a much more expensive car, that is far less safe and doesn't work as well, because execs don't want to fight California regulators.'
Trump has also complained about modern plane navigation systems and electromagnetic aircraft catapult systems that new aircraft carriers are using instead of steam-based systems. In both cases, he said he favored the old-fashioned technology. He has regularly claimed to have extensive knowledge about scientific issues he hasn't studied professionally. 
'I know windmills very much,' Trump said in his Saturday speech. 'I've studied it better than anybody I know.'
He also opined: 'You know we have a world, right? So the world is tiny compared to the universe. So tremendous, tremendous amount of fumes and everything.'
The president has taken a keen interest in a slew of energy-efficiency rules affecting appliances and lighting, which experts describe as the most cost-effective way to curb greenhouse gas emissions linked to climate change. Trump regularly cites his personal experience rather than science. 
 At a White House meeting this month, Trump complained that consumers were struggling to make more-efficient toilets, showers and other appliances work. 
 'People are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times as opposed to once,' the president asserted, adding that he had asked the EPA to study the issue. 
He has also previously complained that energy-efficient bulbs make him look orange.
And at a rally in Michigan last week, the president said that 'women tell me' they have to run their dishwashers repeatedly to get them to work.
Trump has asked top officials at the EPA and the Energy Department, which oversees appliance efficiency standards, repeatedly about weakening Obama-era requirements. He has specifically asked for the chance to weigh in on a change to dishwasher standards that will be finalized next year, according to one senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing deliberations.
 In an interview last week, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said his agency was looking at how it could ensure that consumers could keep buying appliances even if they were less efficient.
 'He has asked us to look into that, and we are looking into it,' Wheeler said, adding that the Energy Department has authority over mandatory energy-efficiency rules.
 The EPA runs the WaterSense program, which provides voluntary labeling on fixtures. The agency estimates that the typical American family can save $380 in annual water costs and save more than 17 gallons of water each day by buying appliances that meet those standards.
Wheeler said the EPA wants 'to make sure that there's enough flexibility that people have, that they can purchase the equipment that they want. And if they want to have more-efficient equipment, then they can purchase that as well.'

Partial invalidation of Affordable Care Act may be gift for Democrats
Less than an hour after an appeals court invalidated part of the Affordable Care Act and pushed off a decision on the rest of it, congressional Democrats began punching, accusing President Trump and his party of imperiling Americans' insurance and consumer health protections.
But on a debate stage Thursday night, Democrats vying for their party's nomination for president did not mention
the major court decision. Instead of pivoting to defend the law and branding Republicans as existential threats to the ACA "" a strategy that helped Democrats win control of the House last year "" the candidates continued their months-long disagreement over whether a single-payer health-care system would be best for the country.
For Republicans, that split-screen Democratic treatment represents both danger and opportunity heading into the 2020 elections. The 98 pages of dusty legal prose redefines battle lines the parties have drawn on health care "" an issue on voters' minds more than nearly any other. But the ruling spares the GOP the political chaos that would have erupted if the New Orleans-based federal court had given the president and other Republicans what they have long sought "" elimination of the entire law.
'The court provided Republicans the opportunity' to continue talking about smaller-bore changes that please consumers, such as drug prices, 'without having to jump into a health-care debate that is extremely unpredictable,' said Josh Holmes, a Republican consultant and former chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).
When it comes to health care and elections, politicians tend to succeed when they can claim the high ground as protectors of aspects of the health-care system that voters value, according to candidates and strategists in both parties. 
'The dominant fact about the politics of health care in the United States is that most people are afraid of sweeping changes to their health-care arrangements, imposed by Washington,' said Ramesh Ponnuru, a conservative scholar affiliated with the American Enterprise Institute.
 Through that lens, this week's ruling, by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, is a gift to Democrats who take it, strategists said. The lawsuit was started by a coalition of Republican attorneys general, and the Trump Justice Department took their side, at first arguing that only the insurance requirement was unconstitutional and later joining the stance of the attorneys general that the whole law was invalid.
The two Republican-appointed jurists in the panel's majority directed a conservative Texas trial judge, who ruled a year ago that the entire ACA was unconstitutional, to 'employ a finer-tooth comb' and reconsider whether the rest of the statute may remain after they ruled against the requirement that most Americans carry insurance.
As a result, parts of the law in limbo include its popular insurance protections for the millions of Americans with preexisting medical conditions, an expansion of Medicaid in three dozen states, federal subsidies for most people who buy health plans through marketplaces created under the law, more preventive care for older Americans and more.
'It leaves the Democrats in a great position, because it elevates the possibility and concern that the ACA could disappear,' said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who has focused on health care as an election issue and is working for former vice president Joe Biden's campaign. 'It also removes a limited amount of credibility Trump was acquiring based on his rhetoric around prescription drugs. This shows he continues to be relentlessly focused on getting rid of the ACA.'
 Democratic congressional candidates are eager to redeploy their strategy from the 2018 midterm elections in which they gained the House majority by portraying themselves as the law's guardians.

'Here's what this means: This lawsuit still threatens to raise health-care costs and eliminate protections for Arizonans with preexisting conditions,' said Mark Kelly, a top Democratic Senate recruit challenging Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.). 
In strikingly similar language, Jaime Harrison, challenging Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), accused his opponent of 'trying to put the health of the millions of Americans that rely on the ACA at risk.'
The ruling 'is unifying for the Democrats,' Ponnuru said. In the presidential primary race, the candidates 'are obviously deeply divided about their own health-care plans. The voters are divided. . . . They are all united about this lawsuit.'

But in not striking down the entire ACA, the appellate ruling carves out space for Republicans to tell voters that nothing is changing for now. In practical terms, holding that the insurance mandate on individuals is unconstitutional has little immediate effect, coming two years after a Republican Congress voted to eliminate the financial penalty the law had imposed on people who failed to have insurance.
Since Wednesday's ruling, Republicans have been relatively quiet. Most who have spoken publicly have emphasized that no American's insurance is changing at the moment.
 In stopping short of voiding a law of more than 2,000 pages, the 5th Circuit spared Senate Republicans and Trump "" who has promised a replacement plan but not produced one "" of the responsibility of drafting new consumer protections they say they would preserve. 
'It helps when you can think through the potential problem, rather than trying to legislate with a gun to your head,' Holmes said.
Asked Thursday about the political impact of the court opinion, Kayleigh McEnany, the Trump campaign's national press secretary, did not answer directly. 'President Trump has lowered prescription drug costs, expanded health care choice, protected preexisting conditions, and removed the vastly unpopular and unconstitutional individual mandate,' she said in a statement. 'The American people recognize that President Trump's policies are working as Democrats threaten to deprive millions of Americans of their employer-provided health care.'
That reference to Medicare-for-all plans, championed by Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), is what makes the health-care issue 'a double-edged sword in 2020,' said Republican pollster Chris Wilson. 
'On the one hand, preexisting conditions were a winning issue for Democrats in 2018 and one many Republicans didn't answer as well as they should have,' he said. 'On the other hand, the big difference between 2018 and 2020 is that Medicare-for-all and government takeover of health care has moved from a fringe position. . . . So now Republicans have a way to hit back.'
 It enables Republicans, hoping to ward off Democratic attacks, to counter with claims that Democrats are the ones working to unravel the current health care system.
'The court not ruling on the constitutionality of Obamacare leaves all of this in play through next November,' Wilson said in an email.
Legal scholars said the limbo period probably will last well past the November elections, as Judge Reed O'Connor, of the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Texas, reconsiders whether the rest of the ACA can be considered legally distinct from the insurance requirement, the 5th Circuit reviews that ruling and the case almost certainly then goes to the Supreme Court.
The Democratic attorney general leading the fight to preserve the law hopes to shorten that limbo. 
'It's time to stop this uncertainty,' California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said Thursday, contending the 5th Circuit panel 'set a time bomb by sending it back to a lower court.'
Becerra told reporters that while he needs to confer with his 20 Democratic counterparts, he wants to ask the Supreme Court to take the case in time to hear and decide it by late spring. He acknowledged the high court already has decided on most of its cases for this term but contended it is not too late.
Amid the swirling politics, some questioned whether the timing of the 5th Circuit's opinion had a political element, since it was published during the House floor debate just before the chamber's vote to impeach Trump.
 'It's always hard to know,' said Nicholas Bagley, a pro-ACA University of Michigan law professor who said the opinion 'has the fingerprints of a partisan hit job.' He said the 5th Circuit panel could have been trying to finish its work before Christmas, or the two Republican-appointed judges in the majority could have been struggling over the opinion's legal reasoning or the Democratic-appointed judge could have been slow in writing her dissent.
Still, Bagley said, 'you release a highly partisan opinion on a day the country is distracted, it's reasonable to ask whether the timing was deliberate.'

Some observers worry
that voters will perceive
a war on prosperity
Pete Buttigieg's recent disclosure of his former consulting clients intensifies a growing battle between Democratic presidential candidates over their ties to the private sector, worrying some in the party that an escalating series of purity tests could turn off voters and convey an exaggerated disdain for business.
The Democratic Party has long included a vigorous anti-corporate strain, but now the debate has turned more personal. The candidates' back-and-forth about their professional and financial ties has put several on the defensive about everything from former legal clients to junior consulting work to donations from company executives. 
'It's imposing a purity test that you can never win,' said Rufus Gifford, a longtime Democratic activist and fundraiser who has donated to Buttigieg and former vice president Joe Biden, among others. 'I just think we have to be very careful about the way we talk about it.' 
Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., on Tuesday night revealed his client list from a 2.5-year stretch at McKinsey - Co. shortly after college. That followed weeks of demands from critics, notably Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), for greater transparency. 
Buttigieg, for his part, has been targeting Warren's corporate legal work when she was a bankruptcy law professor, successfully pressuring her to release information about her fees. 
Democrats like Rep. Don Beyer (Va.), a Buttigieg backer who is traveling to Iowa soon to knock on doors, discounted the tit-for-tat. 'I will be surprised if a single person says 'I can't be for Pete because he worked for McKinsey' or 'I can't be with Elizabeth because she represented a client in a bankruptcy case,' ' Beyer said. 
The exchanges come amid an energetic embrace of liberal economic populism by the leading Democratic candidates. Warren is campaigning heavily on creating a new tax on the richest Americans and has made corruption a central theme; Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), an avowed democratic socialist, routinely rails against the wealthy and decries 'oligarchy' in the United States; Buttigieg and Biden warn frequently of the dangers of income inequality. 
Many Democrats think such messages will be well received by voters concerned about a widening gap between rich and poor. But they also fret that an increasingly aggressive tone could ultimately hurt the party, potentially creating litmus tests and exposing candidates to Republican accusations of a war on prosperity.
'A lot of the argument is 'You're going to get free college, free health care, a bigger bonus for retirement, and we're going to give you a guaranteed income,' ' said former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, ticking through some of the candidates' signature platforms. 'None of it is about how we're going to grow the economy and grow success.'
Emanuel served in the White House under Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, and the current turmoil reflects in part how much the political landscape has changed. Democrats under Clinton were at pains to prove their openness to corporate America; today, they are scrambling to show their distrust of it.
Several Democratic candidates have said they will reject donations not just from companies but also from corporate executives, arguing about whose refusal is strongest.
Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), for example, announced he would reject contributions from pharmaceutical executives after he'd been criticized for being too close to the drug industry. 'You can't campaign wrong and then govern right,' he said at a CNN town hall in March, adding, 'I will not take corporate PAC money, and I will not take federal lobbyists' money.'
Biden also found himself caught by the transformed landscape. He initially opposed the creation of a super PAC to support his candidacy because it might conflict with his image as a middle-class champion. But when his campaign struggled financially, he abandoned that stance, allowing the formation of a pro-Biden super PAC. 
That, in turn, prompted a harsh attack from the Sanders campaign, which declared that 'super PACs exist for one reason and one reason only: to help billionaires and corporations bankroll a presidential campaign with unlimited amounts of money.'
But the recent crossfire between Buttigieg and Warren over their long-ago professional work has been especially pointed. Warren had avoided attacking her rivals by name, but in recent weeks she suggested that Buttigieg needed to disclose his clients from his days as a consultant for McKinsey. 
Warren, who does not hold fundraisers with wealthy donors, also said Buttigieg should allow reporters into his own fundraising events. Buttigieg was being targeted by protesters labeling him 'Wall Street Pete,' though the bulk of his career has been in the military and city government. 
The client list Buttigieg released Tuesday night included Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, the Canadian supermarket chain Loblaws and Best Buy, plus several nonprofit and government entities.
Many Democrats were unhappy to see the Warren-Buttigieg spat, thinking it could damage both candidates and harm the party. 'A chicken can kill a chicken and eat a chicken,' said Chris Adcock, chairwoman of the Page County Democratic Party in rural Iowa. 'They're starting to henpeck each other. We're eating our own.'
The irony, Adcock said, is that President Trump is viewed as one of the most corrupt and least transparent presidents in history. The candidates' rush to satisfy Democratic primary voters could backfire, she said, as it forces candidates to release everything from client lists to legal payments to tax returns to medical records, even as Trump refused to do so.
'We know he's not going to be transparent, so why did we have to do this to each other?' Adcock said. 
Many liberal Democrats, however, see the new scrutiny as a long-overdue course correction by a party that had become too close to corporations and Wall Street, depriving it of an effective message.
'The more that our presidential candidates are putting these issues front and center, the more likely it is that a Democrat will win the White House,' said Rebecca Katz, a liberal strategist who has donated to Warren and others. The problem with 'official Washington,' Katz said, is that 'they don't understand the struggles that so many people are dealing with every day.'
Even some of the more traditional candidates, like former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, said they recognize voters' desire for new guardrails on corporate activity.
'Capitalism has earned its disdain,' said Patrick, who entered the race after leaving his job as a managing director at Bain Capital, a firm vilified by Democrats in the 2012 election. 'We have practiced a kind of capitalism in this country in the last 30 or 40 years that was very short-term focused, without regard for the importance of the long-term consequences on the enterprise or on people or on the planet.' 
Among the Democrats most concerned about the primary's recent tone are House members who captured seats from Republicans in 2018 in upscale suburban battleground districts. Some said voters are not voicing the same complaints about corporations and the wealthy back home. 
Asked whether he was hearing about such issues from his constituents, Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), who has endorsed Booker, said no, adding, 'I'm not focused on that.'
When Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.), who also won her seat in 2018 and supports Booker, was asked whether her constituents are pressing her to take on the wealthy, she responded, 'I haven't been hearing that.' 
 Pressed on whether Democrats should emphasize such ideas or run on the kitchen table issues she and her colleagues campaigned on last year, Sherrill praised bills to lower prescription drug prices and authorize defense spending. 
If any candidate has set the tone for the party's current rhetoric, it's Sanders. The senator from Vermont often brings up 'the billionaire class,' voicing anger at large companies he says have avoided paying their fair share in taxes. As former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg moved closer to entering the race, Sanders singled him out sharply at an Iowa rally, declaring, 'Tonight we say to Mike Bloomberg and other billionaires: Sorry, you ain't gonna buy this election.'
On Tuesday, Sanders unveiled a TV ad in Iowa with similar themes. 'Huge tax breaks for the rich while the middle class continues to struggle,' he says in the commercial, while an image of Trump flashes on screen. 'That's what happens when billionaires are able to control the political system.'
His campaign said it welcomed the discomfort some in the party are expressing. 'Corporate greed has run the country for too long and working people are sick and tired of it. If pointing that out makes the political establishment uncomfortable, that's a good thing,' Sanders spokesman Mike Casca said in a statement. 
There is little doubt the candidates are responding to a newly populist mood in both parties, and Democrats across the political spectrum say they are comfortable with calls to raise taxes on the very rich. Still, many say, the party needs to do a better job of outlining an economic agenda that can break through at a moment when the labor market is strong.

Some worry they are giving Trump ammunition to paint all Democrats as socialists. 'You can be hostile to income inequality, you can be hostile to concentration of wealth and those kind of things,' said Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who dropped out of the presidential race in October and supports Biden. 'But you can't be hostile to business, to free enterprise.'
One potential pitfall for Democrats is that if purity tests are stringent enough, it will be hard for any candidate to survive unscathed.
Biden, who has cultivated a 'Middle Class Joe' image, has enjoyed an explosion of wealth from book deals and speaking fees in recent years. Sanders achieved millionaire status by writing a best-selling book.
'There's way too much focus on what somebody else has,' said former senator Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), reflecting on the candidates targeting the wealthy, 'and not enough on how you're going to right the economy.'

O'Rourke's sudden exit makes plain how swiftly fortunes can change

DES MOINES -
 The Democratic presidential field narrowed and the intensity of its survivors heightened this weekend, with one once-major candidate dropping out and a dozen others frantically trying to avoid that fate in a state that has taken on a striking importance in the 2020 race.
As they have nationally, four candidates have emerged in Iowa from the sprawling pool - the largest and most diverse in history - as the leaders in statewide polling: former vice president Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
Their challengers received a blunt reminder Friday of the stakes three months before the state's caucuses, when the first votes of the 2020 nomination will be cast, as former congressman Beto O'Rourke of Texas abruptly left the race. That came days after another trailing contestant, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), was forced to publicly acknowledge layoffs and consolidations because of her dwindling campaign fundraising.
A series of events in Iowa this weekend marked the beginning of the unofficial sprint to the Feb. 3 caucuses and summoned questions about which candidates would survive until then. All were operating on the hope that Iowa would provide them the sort of political magic that propelled Barack Obama to an upset victory in the 2008 caucuses.
For the trailing candidates, a fundraising dinner for the state party in Des Moines on Friday night was an opportunity to try to break into the top tier - or even just get a little buzz on social media. The evening often felt more like a high school field day competition, but with a blown-up budget, than a sober part of the nomination process.
By the end of the marathon speechmaking, however, it was not clear whether any of the candidates significantly benefited from the exercise or if they just confirmed their status.
Harris, who is shuttering all but one of her campaign offices in New Hampshire to focus more heavily on Iowa, showed up Friday night with a marching band and bought hundreds of tickets for supporters. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) gave a deeply personal speech about his mentor - and was accompanied by his girlfriend, actress Rosario Dawson. Businessman Andrew Yang held a predinner ""Yangapalooza"" featuring a member of Weezer. Former housing secretary Julián Castro ignored his time limit. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who has recently seen gains in the state, passionately shouted again and again that she could ""win big"" as a supporter in the audience blew a Gjallarhorn.
The major difficulty for all of them is the uncertainty that has seized the Iowa electorate, which is largely torn as it tries to ascertain the best candidate to go up against President Trump. Even in the far reaches of rural Iowa, Democrats openly fret about electability as if they were television pundits, wondering how a particular candidate will play with voters in states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania - or how they will fare on the general-election debate stage.
""You saw what happened last time,"" said Nina Smith, 80, a retiree who attended a recent event for Booker in West Des Moines but remains undecided in the race. ""You can love someone so much in your heart, but in your head, you wonder if they can really beat Trump.""
Margaret Torrie, a 72-year-old retiree from Ames, said the pressure of making a decision was so stressful that she was having nightmares.
""The number one issue for me is that I don't want to see Trump reelected,"" said Torrie, an undecided voter who recently attended a Harris event. ""But I have these dreams, these almost Technicolor dreams where we've picked the wrong person, and I wake up in the middle of the night in a panic.""
The state has been swarming with candidates for months, but it was even more saturated this weekend with the Liberty and Justice dinner and its accompanying festivities Friday, followed Saturday by several issue-focused town halls, campaign rallies and a fish fry in eastern Iowa organized by Rep. Abby Finkenauer, a young Democrat who beat a Republican incumbent in 2018 in a district packed with counties that voted for both Obama and Trump.
The historic number of candidates has exhausted some Iowans, who have grown weary of the relentless contact from numerous campaigns desperate to cultivate every last bit of support. Volunteers from the Warren and Sanders campaigns have accidentally phoned each other during competing phone banking, and some voters say they have stopped answering calls from phone numbers they don't recognize.
""It's like 10 people trying to walk through the same door at the exact same time,"" said Grant Woodard, a Des Moines attorney and former Democratic operative who is unaligned in the race.
The weekend demonstrated a markedly sharper tone on the part of several candidates. Warren said that Biden was ""running in the wrong presidential primary"" and warned, without naming names, that nominating a candidate promising ""business as usual"" after Trump would result in a Democratic loss. Representatives for Sanders and Biden swapped cutting insults in debating the cost of Sanders's Medicare-for-all proposal. On Friday night, Buttigieg promised not to ""get so wrapped up in the fighting that we start to think fighting is the point,"" to which Warren countered: ""Anyone who comes on this stage and tells you they can make change without a fight is not going to win that fight.""
The Iowa strategies of these candidates mirror how they hope to appeal nationally.
Biden's approach is similar to those of Democrats in years past, based on an assumption that next year's caucus-goers will be the usual crowd - mostly white, mostly older. His Iowa staff of about 100 has hyperfocused on turning out senior citizens and working-class Democrats in rural and conservative parts of the state, especially those who voted for Trump. Sanders, who relies heavily on a network of volunteers in addition to an Iowa staff of 112, has been trying to energize his longtime supporters, who include many young voters, and make inroads with Iowa Latinos. The coming week, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez plans to join him at a series of Iowa rallies.
Buttigieg, who waited until late summer to build his Iowa operation, is making nearly weekly visits to Iowa and like Biden has focused heavily on the counties that voted twice for Obama and then picked Trump in 2016, hoping his more moderate positions and message of unity will resonate. Klobuchar has taken a similar approach and has visited a number of counties that voted heavily for Trump in 2016, touting her ability to win in rural Minnesota counties.
Harris spent 15 days in the state in October and is trying to save money for a seven-digit television ad buy in Iowa in the weeks before the caucuses, according to her staff. Unlike Biden's staff, hers is focused on voters they hope to pull into the caucus mix, especially young people and ""Blue Wave Women"" who became politically active after Trump was elected and played a key role in Democratic wins in 2018.
Warren, who is widely credited with having built the most formidable ground operation in the race months ago, has focused on an array of voters, opening campaign offices in both liberal hubs and conservative enclaves.
""Elizabeth Warren is in a league of her own, in terms of the organization, the operation,"" said Sean Bagniewski, chairman of the Polk County Democrats, which encompasses the Des Moines metro area. ""To me the big story is, who can even put up a fight with her right now?""
She, and to a lesser extent Buttigieg, have risen in state polls as Biden has appeared to weaken. The former vice president has suffered from poor fundraising compared with the other leaders, and last week a super PAC intended to help him make up ground was officially opened by supporters.
Tom Vilsack, the former governor of Iowa and agriculture secretary in the Obama administration, who has not endorsed a candidate, raised questions about Warren's expansive agenda and how she would push it through a Congress less liberal than she is. He hesitated to evaluate the field's strengths and staying power.
""I don't know whether any of these candidates are able to take a punch,"" he said.
Warren, Buttigieg and Sanders have attracted large crowds at events throughout the state, while Biden's audiences have been noticeably smaller - a circumstance that was apparent over the weekend as well.
At a rally ahead of the Friday night fundraising dinner, Biden's staff walked through the crowd with handfuls of extra tickets, searching for people to fill the seats they had purchased. At the dinner, hundreds of empty seats remained in six upper-level sections reserved by the campaign.

For all of the candidates, the weekend put into sharp relief what can happen to those failing to break through the crowded primary. O'Rourke's departure came, his staff later said, after he decided he didn't want to make some of the changes that Harris has been making, like cutting staff to finance commercials.
O'Rourke gathered with his supporters on the banks of the Des Moines River, promising to continue to fight for issues he cares about and urging them to stay engaged. He spent an hour comforting those who had believed in him.
""This is going to be good. I promise,"" he said to one supporter. And to several others: ""Keep the faith."" Several people told O'Rourke they were unsure whether they would find another candidate, and he assured them that they would. As he embraced one woman, the sound of her sobs mixed with the high-beat tempo of another candidate's marching band nearby.
Inside the arena, O'Rourke's campaign staff and volunteers abandoned their posts, leaving behind boxes of chant instructions - including ""I-O-W-A, Beto's going all the way"" - that would never be passed out, a reminder of how quickly a candidate could vanish from the race.

Former N.Y. mayor opens 2020 bid pledging to 'rebuild America'

Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, one of the world's richest people, announced his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination Sunday by promising to 'rebuild America' and defeat President Trump. 
The announcement, which Bloomberg telegraphed for weeks even after deciding earlier this year not to run, reflects his view that the current field of Democratic candidates is not well-positioned to win in 2020. 
Bloomberg has promised a disruptive campaign that could break spending records with a massive advertising buy aimed at states that vote in March and April.
'I believe my unique set of experiences in business, government and philanthropy will enable me to win and lead,' Bloomberg said in a statement on his redesigned campaign website. 'As a candidate, I'll rally a broad and diverse coalition of Americans to win. And as president, I have the skills to fix what is broken in our great nation. And there is a lot broken.'
In an accompanying video, Bloomberg offered a preview of what he will focus on in the race, including his philanthropic work fighting gun violence, closing coal-fired power plants and funding medical research. Without offering specifics, the announcement video says he will push for the wealthy to pay more in taxes and to guarantee health care to all Americans without removing private insurance from anyone who wants it. 
His campaign has made more than $30-million in television advertising reservations to help introduce him as a candidate. The ads will start Monday. He also has plans for what advisers call an 'aggressive and robust digital strategy.'
Bloomberg has also announced a $100-million ad campaign to criticize Trump in key battleground states and a $15-million voter registration effort in those same places. Those initial spending plans are already double the amount raised by the top fundraiser in the Democratic field, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), through September.
Sanders, who has described his own campaign as a fight against the billionaire class, has been particularly critical of Bloomberg's entry into the race. 
'I'm disgusted by the idea that Michael Bloomberg or any other billionaire thinks they can circumvent the political process and spend tens of millions of dollars to buy our elections,' Sanders said Friday in a statement. 'It's just the latest example of a rigged political system that we are going to change when we're in the White House.'
The initial Bloomberg ad campaign, in English and Spanish, will focus on his biography in an effort to introduce him to voters.
'Mike is not nearly as well-known to Democratic voters as some of the other contestants,' campaign adviser Howard Wolfson said. 'When they learn of his unique set of accomplishments in business, government and philanthropy, they respond very positively. His story is compelling: middle-class kid who made good and did good.' 
Wolfson said Bloomberg, who has a net worth of more than $50-billion, would release his tax returns over the course of the campaign, though he has not set a date to do so. 
In a statement to employees, Bloomberg News editor in chief John Micklethwait said the company 'will continue our tradition of not investigating Mike (and his family and foundation) and we will extend the same policy to his rivals in the Democratic primaries.' 
 The company will also stop publishing unsigned editorials, which reflected the former mayor's personal views. 
Bloomberg does not plan to raise any money for his race, though his campaign signaled an aggressive effort to attract volunteers and build an email list of supporters. His campaign will have an online store of campaign merchandise. 
One of the first products is a T-shirt with one of his favorite aphorisms, 'In God we trust. Everyone else bring data.'

Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire businessman who is taking steps to run for president, has launched a $100 million digital ad campaign attacking President Trump in the battleground states expected to determine next year's election.
The effort will provide a significant boost to Democratic efforts "" now totaling at least $325 million in public commitments "" to keep the heat on Trump while Democratic candidates battle each other to win the party's presidential nomination. 
'Our thinking is that the general election has already begun,' said Jason Schechter, a Bloomberg spokesman.
The outlay, which far exceeds what any Democratic candidate has raised or spent so far in the race, adds to those of several other outside groups who have devoted money to early swing state campaigns. 
Priorities USA, an independent Democratic nonprofit and super PAC effort, has already spent about $7 million of a $100 million campaign for swing state anti-Trump advertising during the primaries. American Bridge, a group that typically focuses on opposition research, launched a $3 million campaign this week focused on rural white voters as part of an effort expected to reach $50 million.
A third group, Acronym, which is being advised by former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe, has announced plans for $75 million in digital ads against Trump.
The money is intended to challenge the significant advantages of incumbency in presidential campaigns. Trump's campaign announced $156 million in cash on hand at the end of September, after raising $125 million in the previous three months. 
By contrast, the top fundraising Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), has raised less than $75-million through the first three quarters of the year. former vice president Joe Biden, who has led national nomination polls this year, has raised less than $38-million in the same nine months. 
Trump has also dominated Democratic candidates so far on digital spending. On Facebook, the Trump campaign and its affiliates have purchased $14.7 million in ads this year, according to the social network, compared with $5.45 million by South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and $4.3-million by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). 
Much of the early digital spending by candidates is focused on prospecting for more campaign donors, not on persuading swing state voters. An analysis by Priorities USA of recent Trump Facebook ads found that 89 percent of the messages were focused on acquiring new donors and voter information, including spots that ask people to wish Trump a happy birthday or buy campaign gear. 
'Sometimes you spell 'desperation' d-e-m-o-c-r-a-t-s,' Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, said in response to the news of the new Bloomberg digital effort, which was first reported by the New York Times. 
A pro-Trump independent effort, the America First Action super PAC and an affiliated group, has announced a fundraising goal of $300 million for the 2020 cycle to defend Trump in battleground states. That spending is expected to focus on Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan. 

In one Bloomberg ad provided to The Washington Post, Trump's Twitter feed is highlighted along with the message: 'A tweet shouldn't threaten our country's security.' 
The digital campaign began Friday, with plans for spending in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Arizona, according to Bloomberg aides. They said Bloomberg will not appear in the ads, which will nonetheless make clear he paid for them.
'If Mike runs, it is because he believes that Donald Trump is an existential threat, and this demonstrates his commitment to defeating him,' said Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to Bloomberg. 
Bloomberg, one of the world's richest men, has taken several steps to prepare for a bid for the Democratic nomination, including filing paperwork in states with early deadlines to get on the ballot. He has also been calling top party officials to let them know of his plans. 
The move marks a major reversal for Bloomberg, who announced in March that he would not run for president. At the time, he said he was 'clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination' and would instead focus on spending his money in an effort to hurt Trump's chances in swing states. 
But he and his advisers have since concluded that there is a possible route to the nomination because of lingering divisions in the field and the vulnerabilities of the top-polling candidates. 
 The decision to reconsider signals, among other things, a public rebuke of Biden's performance so far. The former vice president has attempted to build a coalition of the same moderate Democrats that Bloomberg would court.

Policy topic reshapes presidential race as senator drops in polls
In mid-November, a few dozen of the country's most influential advocates of Medicare-for-all were reviewing details of Sen. Elizabeth Warren's plan to finance the proposed government-run program when they learned that she had unexpectedly changed her position.
Warren (Mass.), who had excited liberals when she initially embraced a Medicare-for-all idea first proposed by rival Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), was suggesting a more centrist idea: to delay enactment of the single-payer system and, in the interim, give consumers the choice to opt in. The change might have seemed insignificant to most Americans, but to many in the suburban Washington conference room, Warren's new stance marked an abrupt retreat, according to several people in attendance.

That moment highlighted the political turbulence that Warren has experienced in recent weeks as she has attempted to extricate herself from a policy dilemma that has blunted her steady rise to the top ranks of the Democratic nominating contest.
 Warren had pleased many on the left with proposals to take on entrenched corporate and political power. But she was being warned that support for Medicare-for-all, including the elimination of private health insurance used by more than 150-million Americans, could cost her support among Democrats looking for the strongest candidate to take on President Trump. 
'As [Medicare-for-all] got more attention, more and more people began to say, 'Yeah, that's a mistake [that] she showed flexibility,' ' said former congressman Barney Frank of Massachusetts. 'But I guess she felt she couldn't make herself totally vulnerable to the Sanders people by abandoning [Medicare-for-all] altogether.'
'It would have been better to do it earlier,' Frank said of her shift, adding that he had privately told her that backing the Sanders plan was 'a terrible mistake.' 
 Recent polling suggests Warren has sustained political damage from her health-care policy. After climbing to the top of the field by focusing on a message of overhauling Washington and Wall Street, Warren plateaued as her campaign became consumed with health care. 
Now, she is falling. 
Nationally, Warren has dropped from a high of about 27-percent in October's RealClearPolitics' average of polls to near 16 percent at the end of last month. In Iowa, she has dropped about five points in that same period, and in New Hampshire, her support has been cut in half, according to the calculation. Warren's decline has coincided with the rise of a new entrant into the top tier: South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has backed a more moderate health-care agenda and accused Warren of failing to make clear how she would pay for her plan. 
This account of Warren's health-care policy struggles "" and the political repercussions that have rapidly shifted the dynamics of the 2020 Democratic race "" is based on interviews with 27 advisers, experts and others familiar with the campaign's deliberations on the issue, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly.
The irony is that a candidate whose political identity has been built in part on her reputation as a policy wonk "" a potential president who boasts of having a plan for nearly every challenge facing everyday Americans "" has been tripped up by a policy issue that has dominated politics and defined her party for years. 

In some ways, the health-care debate was uniquely suited to entangle Warren, who as a senator had never made the issue a central element of her worldview.
She embraced a single-payer system as she planned her presidential run, signing onto Sanders's Medicare-for-all bill in 2017. But Warren wanted "" and felt duty-bound by her brand "" to offer detailed plans to explain how it would work. Then the landscape shifted, as health-care industry groups aired ads attacking her plan and some top-tier rivals said she was refusing to acknowledge what Sanders had conceded: that middle-class taxes would rise to pay for it.
The result for Warren is a muddle, with some liberal activists feeling betrayed and little evidence emerging that she has neutralized criticism from the middle.
'As Warren's health-care plan has been fleshed out, it does very much straddle the moderate and progressive wings of the Democratic Party right now,' said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. 'As is often the case when you're trying to straddle, you don't satisfy either side.'
Warren's team says that she has strongly supported Medicare-for-all since she signed on to Sanders's bill. She has repeatedly told reporters that she has been working for 'months and months' to develop a way to pay for it that doesn't include higher taxes on the middle class, which some economists say she has achieved. 
Several academics noted that they'd been in touch with Warren's campaign since early in her candidacy about key details. 'I've been very impressed by the intellectual discipline,' said Donald Berwick, a former Obama administration health-care official who often emailed with the campaign about her proposal. 
'I've always seen a very pragmatic side to the way she thinks about health policy,' added Ezekiel Emanuel, another top health-care expert who has offered advice to Warren in her roles as senator and presidential candidate. 'I think that's been my major understanding of who she is as a person and how she thinks about things. . . . That's the way I heard the recognition of the revised timeline.'
Some of Warren's allies are privately frustrated by what they see as the gaps that Sanders left unfilled in his health-care plan and his willingness to 'self-immolate,' as one person said, his chances in a general election by supporting a middle-class tax increase to pay for it. 
So far, Warren's pivot on her approach to Medicare-for-all hasn't fully reassured some leading Democrats who are drawn to her but not yet sold. 
 'She would have sealed the deal if she said, 'Make no mistake, I think Medicare-for-all is the right thing and I'm going to create a structure to study it and finance it. But in the meantime, I'm going to provide a guide path,' ' said one top New Hampshire Democrat.
Meanwhile, the pivot to calling for a transition phase opens questions about what Warren believes. 'It looks defensive,' this person said.
The origins of Warren's health-care conundrum can be traced to her earliest days in politics. 
She didn't support single-payer health care in her 2012 Senate run. And as a new senator,Warren was never seen as an ally in the fight for government-run health care, even by the liberal groups who otherwise supported her. 

'It's this weird relationship where everyone really respects her, but it didn't feel like we had someone out in front as a health-care justice warrior,' said Ture Turnbull, who served as executive director of MassCare, a Massachusetts health-care advocacy group. Turnbull added that Warren seemed mostly focused on protecting the Affordable Care Act.


Although she had signed on to Sanders's bill, Warren rarely mentioned the program on the stump in the opening weeks of her presidential campaign this year. 
She appeared to keep her distance in high-profile interviews, telling Bloomberg TV in January that there are 'multiple bills' that ensure affordable health care for every American. In March, she said at a CNN town hall that there are different 'pathways' to a government-run health plan and that there 'could' be a role for private health insurance coverage.
Some activists interpreted her remarks as wishy-washy, putting her out of step with the left wing of the party that she was courting. 
'The stuff that came out in the spring, we communicated to [Warren's campaign] staff that we were uncomfortable with the equivocation,' said Stephanie Woolhandler, who has counseled Warren on health policy for several years and is also the co-founder of Physicians for a National Health Program, a single-payer advocacy group. 'We advised against equivocating and taking halfway steps.'

The concerns reverberated in Warren's Boston campaign headquarters, where preparations were underway for the first formal debate of the 2020 campaign cycle, set for June in Miami. 'The Warren campaign was deeply anxious about Bernie in the weeks before the first Democratic debate,' said someone who talks frequently with Warren's campaign and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly about its thinking at the time.
Among liberals, those fears lifted when, during the debate, Warren's hand shot into the air in response to a question about who onstage would get rid of the private health insurance industry. 'So, yes, I'm with Bernie on Medicare-for-all,' she said.
Rather than settling the matter, new questions emerged. 
Warren's competitors were moving away from the plan. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), who endured sharp criticism for an earlier answer in which she seemed to support eliminating private insurance, released her own health-care plan in July that allowed a 10-year transition to Medicare-for-all. 'I listened to American families who said, 'I want an option,' ' Harris explained days after she made the change. 
Buttigieg began rising in the polls. Although he had tweeted in early 2018 that he was in 'favor' of Medicare-for-all, during the presidential campaign he repeatedly talked about 'Medicare for all who want it' and released a plan in September that would open Medicare to many Americans as a public option but allow private insurance to continue.
By the end of September, Buttigieg was running TV ads in Iowa that contrasted his approach with unnamed rivals who back Medicare-for-all. 'Others say, 'It is Medicare-for-all or nothing,' ' Buttigieg says in the 30-second spot. 'The choice should be yours.'
The industry piled on. The Partnership for America's Health Care Future, a coalition of hospitals and insurance companies, launched a $1-million TV ad campaign against Medicare-for-all and other changes to health care. Forty percent of it was dumped into Iowa media markets, ground zero for the Democratic campaign, according to data from Advertising Analytics. One spot claimed that 'unaffordable proposals' to change health care 'could double everyone's income taxes.' Another claimed that overhaul plans would mean 'higher taxes or higher premiums.' 
Another group led by Republican strategist Steven Law has spent $5.9 million on TV ads opposing Medicare-for-all, including roughly $650,000 in Iowa, Law said. The ads made a case that wait times for doctor visits would lengthen, a message that caused particular angst for women, Law said.
On the ground in the early states, Warren heard skeptical questions about Medicare-for-all in her public town hall meetings and during private meetings that her staff frequently arranges with key community leaders before she goes onstage. The exchanges were a reminder that many in Warren's base of largely educated affluent voters might not be ready to give up their private health plans.
'The fact of the matter is, the people who are going to be more likely to show up at her events are going to be people who already have pretty good health insurance,' said Rod Sullivan, a member of the Board of Supervisors in Johnson County, Iowa, who has endorsed Warren. 'So when other candidates sow the seeds of doubt with them and say, 'She's going to kick you off this. What if it's worse than what you have?' Those people are nervous.'
Sullivan recalls standing by Warren in mid-September as she mingled with about 50 people hand selected for a private chat with her ahead of a rally. As these local Democrats came up to talk with her, he said, health care was a constant topic.
'People were saying, 'Well, I'm concerned about this or that.' And Warren was reminding people that what you have now is bankrupting you,' he said. 
The pressure came to a boiling point when candidates met in Ohio in mid-October for a marathon three-hour debate. It was the first one in which Warren had taken the lead in several surveys "" and her rivals came prepared to go after what they saw as a glaring vulnerability. They zeroed in on Warren's repeated refusal to say whether middle-class taxes would go up.
'Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything, except for this,' Buttigieg said.
'At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,' said Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, one of several more moderate contenders. 'And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice.'
Seven days after the debate, Warren told an audience in Indianola, Iowa, that she would soon release a plan to pay for her Medicare-for-all proposal. 
Behind the scenes, Warren's staff worked frantically to come up with answers, with staffers reaching out repeatedly to academics to test various ideas.
On Nov. 1, Warren released a $20.5 trillion plan that would rely mostly on tax increases on the rich and on companies, her campaign said, adding that it would avoid any tax hikes for the middle class.
Once again, Warren seemed to succeed only in further complicating her political predicament. 
While she was trying to reassure the left of her loyalty to the Medicare-for-all cause, she was also promising to carry the fight to the general election by introducing a massive tax on the rich and companies, adding levies that economists argued would be passed on to workers. She was effectively daring Trump, who has expressed eagerness to portray the Democrats as socialists, to paint her as a tax-and-spend liberal who would take away health insurance from millions in her first term.


Centrists pounced.
Former vice president Joe Biden said Warren's cost estimates were off by trillions. 'She's making it up. There is no way,' Biden said in an interview with 'PBS NewsHour.'
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who credits a more moderate stance on health care focused on protecting the Affordable Care Act with helping the Democrats take the House in 2018, used a TV interview that day to warn of potential danger ahead for her party "" though she did not mention Warren by name. 
'I'm not a big fan of Medicare-for-all,' Pelosi told Bloomberg TV, adding: 'Hopefully, as we emerge into the election year, the mantra will be, 'More health care for all Americans.' Because there is a comfort level that some people have with their current private insurance.'
Two weeks later, on Nov. 15, Warren offered yet another health-care announcement: the 'transition plan' that would include an intermediate step letting Americans participate in an optional government-run health plan before an attempt to pass a mandatory program is made.
'By the end of my first 100 days, we will have opened the door for tens of millions of Americans to get high-quality Medicare for All coverage at little or no cost,' Warren wrote in a Medium post. 'But I won't stop there. Throughout my term, I'll fight for additional health system reforms.'

Warren added, 'No later than my third year in office, I will fight to pass legislation that would complete the transition to full Medicare for All.'
It was seen by many on the left as a clear concession.
'You should use the political momentum you have to pass a single plan and use the years in between defending and broadening support for it,' said Mark Dudzic, national coordinator of the Labor Campaign for Single Payer Healthcare, which urges unions to support Medicare-for-all. Dudzic added that he still considers Warren a supporter of Medicare-for-all.
To answer lingering questions about her position, Warren has begun dispatching a policy adviser to Iowa to present the details of her program in small sessions.
The campaign also has worked to line up supporters "" which wasn't always an easy sell. 
A key person in validating Warren's plan has been Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the House sponsor of the Medicare-for-all legislation, who praised it despite the objections of some members of her staff, according to two people familiar with the discussions.
The congressional staffers have expressed reservations that Warren's plan would not push for a single-payer system until the third year of her administration, according to these people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly of the staffers' private views about internal talks. Jayapal's spokesman denied that claim. 
Warren's campaign has tried to describe the three-year delay in pushing for Medicare-for-all as a minor adjustment. At the same time, Warren goes to great lengths to offer reassurance to people that she's heard their concerns about her earlier position. 
At a small town hall in Ankeny, Iowa, on Monday afternoon, Bailey Caskey, a student at the University of Northern Iowa who has committed to caucus for Warren, asked how she could convince her mother on the merits of Medicare-for-all. 
For about six minutes, Warren explained "" in more detail than usual "" how she planned to transition to the system.

'My basic notion has been, we try to get as much help as we can to as many people as we can as fast as we can,' Warren said.

Senator urged to talk about heart attack when he returns to the trail
Prominent friends and supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) say he should cut back on his relentless campaign pace and speak openly about his recent heart attack when he returns to the campaign trail, urging a shift toward a more personal and less hectic campaign than he has run so far.
The comments reflect what supporters describe as a deeply personal decision with big implications for Sanders's candidacy: how the 78-year-old democratic socialist, viewed by many of his backers as the leader of a movement, should proceed following a health scare that has sidelined him for days and raised questions about whether he can - or should - maintain the punishing demands of a presidential campaign.
""I would be very open about the experience he had,"" said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a national co-chair of the Sanders campaign who made his pitch to the senator in a brief telephone conversation last week. ""I think it can show a resilience, a sense of empathy and a sense of vulnerability."" 
Sanders supporters privately acknowledge concern that the heart attack could give voters second thoughts about the candidate, who would be the oldest president in history if elected. In an effort to move beyond the setback, some hope he can seize on the event to transmit a softer side that's eluded him.
The goal, said Khanna, would be to ""make a very human connection."" He said he texted the senator's wife, Jane Sanders, last week to tell her that this could be Sanders's ""FDR moment,"" referring to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose battle with polio is sometimes said to have contributed to his empathy for the less fortunate. 
The sensitivity of dealing with the heart attack has been evident since the episode occurred. The campaign did not immediately disclose the heart attack, initially saying only that Sanders had experienced chest pains and had two stents inserted in an artery.
Advisers and friends also say Sanders should consider easing his breakneck campaign pace. Sanders has been sprinting across the country, holding multiple events per day, maintaining a speed that has surpassed his top rivals.
""If I were giving him advice, I would tell him just slack up a little bit,"" said former Senate majority leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), who visited Sanders in a Las Vegas hospital last week. ""Even if he slacks up a little bit, he's campaigning more than anybody else.""
Sanders spent Monday recuperating at home in Burlington, Vt. On a conference call with staff, he reiterated that the movement he has been leading is not about him, a theme he often hits in campaign speeches. 
""If there's anything that this event kind of tells us, it is the importance of what our message is in this campaign. And our message is 'Us, not me,' "" Sanders said, according to a person with knowledge of his remarks.
Campaign officials have signaled that he is not expected to return to the trail until the Oct. 15 debate near Columbus, Ohio. That makes the debate a critical event for the campaign, as Sanders will face considerable scrutiny from voters and rivals sizing up his health and vitality.
""Bernie is raring to go, and his campaign staff has been trying to hold him back until the debate,"" said Ben Cohen, who co-founded Ben & Jerry's ice cream and serves as a national co-chair of the campaign. ""The plan is for the debate to be his reentry into the race.""
People with knowledge of the situation said there had been a period of uncertainty about the campaign's future in the immediate aftermath of Sanders's hospitalization for chest pains last week. The campaign suspended an Iowa ad buy and made reassuring calls to supporters during those first hours.
But in recent days, the campaign has shown determination to move full speed ahead. The Iowa ad touting Sanders will be on the airwaves starting Tuesday. 
The campaign rolled out a new policy proposal Monday aimed at curtailing the role of money in politics. It would eliminate big-dollar fundraising for all federal elections, enact a constitutional amendment to declare that campaign contributions are not speech and end corporate contributions to the party conventions.
Surrogates campaigned for Sanders in the key early states over the weekend, a strategy the campaign plans to continue. Cohen said he plans to campaign for Sanders this weekend in New Hampshire. 
The campaign is also aggressively calling voters. After establishing a goal of making a million calls in the early primary states over the past 10 days, it beat that goal by 300,000 calls, the campaign said.
Sanders and his allies have also used his heart attack to call attention to his push to enact a Medicare-for-all universal health-care system. They note that while Sanders was fortunate to have access to good doctors and treatment, many Americans do not. 
And Sanders has already begun showing a more personal side of himself. When he left the hospital on Friday, he stood shoulder-to-shoulder with his wife, Jane, smiling and waving. When he returned to Burlington, reporters there noted Sanders saying he was ""happy to be home"" before walking inside where family was waiting. 
On Monday, he and Jane took a walk in the rain, and he joked with reporters he said should get paid more for working in the drizzle. 
When he launched his second campaign for president early this year, advisers encouraged Sanders to speak about his participation in the civil rights movement and his modest upbringing in Brooklyn. He mentioned those things at early campaign stops. But as time went on, they faded from his stump speeches. 
Sanders has been trailing former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) in many recent polls, sparing him the pressure that can face the front-runner. His Democratic rivals have either wished Sanders well or brushed aside questions about his physical fitness for office. And President Trump and his allies have been preoccupied with the impeachment inquiry. 
These external events have led some Sanders allies to conclude that he does not have to rush back onto the national stage. 
""The next months are going to be dominated by the impeachment inquiry, not the presidential race,"" said Khanna. ""His volunteers can do a lot of the work and he just needs to focus on recovering.""
In a sign of how the Sanders movement has charged ahead without him on the trail, a video created by a supporter arguing that he's been criticized unfairly by the media had received 6 million views as of late Monday.
As Sanders recovers, his campaign has taken steps to reassure staffers and supporters, scheduling calls and other outreach to keep allies focused. 
""The campaign reached out to me to let me know that he was doing fine. They gave me the details, which made me feel really comfortable,"" said Deb Marlin, an Iowa small-business owner who has endorsed Sanders. 
Reid recalled spending 30 to 45 minutes with Sanders on Thursday. They reminisced about their work in the Senate and talked about health care, Reid said. As for the next debate, Reid said Sanders ought to take things slowly before then. 
""He should take it easy until then,"" said Reid. ""As far as I understand, that's what he's going to do.""

Joe Biden on Saturday sought to take a more aggressive tone in combating President Trump, a shift in strategy amid signs of worry among campaign donors and supporters that his message is getting lost in an onslaught from the White House.
Biden wrote an op-ed that was published Saturday night in The Washington Post, attempting to refocus attention on Trump's impropriety in asking Ukrainian leaders to investigate Biden's family.
""Enough is enough. Every day - every few hours, seemingly - more evidence is uncovered revealing that President Trump is abusing the power of the presidency and is wholly unfit to be president,"" Biden wrote. ""He is using the highest office in the land to advance his personal political interests instead of the national interest.""
""He does not understand the immense responsibility demanded of all those who hold the office of the president of the United States,"" Biden continued. ""He sees only the power - and how it can benefit just one person: Donald Trump.""
Biden's move came amid growing anxiety among his supporters that he is unprepared to handle the dual challenges of running a general-election campaign against Trump while simultaneously facing an intensifying Democratic primary contest. 
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) has started to eclipse him in several polls, and Biden last week reported raising only $15.2 million during the last quarter - nearly $10 million less than Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Biden's supporters also have bridled that Democrats have been slow to rush to his defense.
Biden's campaign on Saturday night distributed a memo to reporters from deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield. The subject of the memo highlighted the twin challenges that one of the leading candidates has faced: ""Biden Campaign Will Hammer Donald Trump While Focusing On The Issues.""
""This campaign will continue to focus on the issues that impact people's lives while simultaneously hammering Donald Trump for his unprecedented abuse of power and correcting the record on the mountain of lies Trump and his allies continue to spread about Joe Biden,"" Bedingfield wrote.
She outlined three strategies that the campaign is attempting to employ: calling out inaccuracies in Trump's charges, fighting back against Trump and talking about issues they believe voters care most about.
Biden and his campaign have struggled over the past two weeks amid a flurry of developments that have launched a House impeachment inquiry in which Biden is a central player. Biden has alternated between pushing back on Trump and seeming unsure of how to handle a situation that has placed the focus on his son Hunter.
For several days at a time, he had few public events, the only responses coming from his remarks at fundraisers at which a handful of reporters are allowed inside. But even then, he has openly ruminated about Trump in various directions.
Biden on Thursday night in San Francisco talked about the allegations, then quickly shifted to say, ""This isn't about me, it's about you."" His focus then turned back toward himself, as he noted how he was the one who defeated Trump in most polls.
He then went on to talk about his son, making light of a false allegation by Trump that Hunter Biden had made $1.5 billion in China.
""I wonder where the hell that money is, man, because I've got to pay tuitions,"" Biden said. ""God bless me!""
Then he said aloud that he couldn't get into the ""mosh pit"" with Trump because the focus should be on issues like climate change and guns. After devoting several minutes to that, he said, ""I don't want to get sucked into this, what he likes to do.""
Biden's Post op-ed attempted to focus on Trump's latest attacks, as well as a broader indictment of his presidency. He criticized the president on climate change and for not doing more to stand up for the rights of protesters in Hong Kong.
""Our first president, George Washington, famously could not tell a lie,"" Biden wrote. ""President Trump seemingly cannot tell the truth - about anything. He slanders anyone he sees as a threat. That is why is he is frantically pushing flat-out lies, debunked conspiracy theories and smears against me and my family, no doubt hoping to undermine my candidacy for the presidency.""
Biden has bet that voters are familiar with his long tenure in public life, which he hopes will make him more resilient to Trump's attacks than earlier presidential targets.
""Please know that I'm not going anywhere,"" he wrote, addressing Trump. ""You won't destroy me, and you won't destroy my family. And come November 2020, I intend to beat you like a drum.""

Partial invalidation of Affordable Care Act may be gift for Democrats
Less than an hour after an appeals court invalidated part of the Affordable Care Act and pushed off a decision on the rest of it, congressional Democrats began punching, accusing President Trump and his party of imperiling Americans' insurance and consumer health protections.
But on a debate stage Thursday night, Democrats vying for their party's nomination for president did not mention
the major court decision. Instead of pivoting to defend the law and branding Republicans as existential threats to the ACA "" a strategy that helped Democrats win control of the House last year "" the candidates continued their months-long disagreement over whether a single-payer health-care system would be best for the country.
For Republicans, that split-screen Democratic treatment represents both danger and opportunity heading into the 2020 elections. The 98 pages of dusty legal prose redefines battle lines the parties have drawn on health care "" an issue on voters' minds more than nearly any other. But the ruling spares the GOP the political chaos that would have erupted if the New Orleans-based federal court had given the president and other Republicans what they have long sought "" elimination of the entire law.
'The court provided Republicans the opportunity' to continue talking about smaller-bore changes that please consumers, such as drug prices, 'without having to jump into a health-care debate that is extremely unpredictable,' said Josh Holmes, a Republican consultant and former chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).
When it comes to health care and elections, politicians tend to succeed when they can claim the high ground as protectors of aspects of the health-care system that voters value, according to candidates and strategists in both parties. 
'The dominant fact about the politics of health care in the United States is that most people are afraid of sweeping changes to their health-care arrangements, imposed by Washington,' said Ramesh Ponnuru, a conservative scholar affiliated with the American Enterprise Institute.
 Through that lens, this week's ruling, by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, is a gift to Democrats who take it, strategists said. The lawsuit was started by a coalition of Republican attorneys general, and the Trump Justice Department took their side, at first arguing that only the insurance requirement was unconstitutional and later joining the stance of the attorneys general that the whole law was invalid.
The two Republican-appointed jurists in the panel's majority directed a conservative Texas trial judge, who ruled a year ago that the entire ACA was unconstitutional, to 'employ a finer-tooth comb' and reconsider whether the rest of the statute may remain after they ruled against the requirement that most Americans carry insurance.
As a result, parts of the law in limbo include its popular insurance protections for the millions of Americans with preexisting medical conditions, an expansion of Medicaid in three dozen states, federal subsidies for most people who buy health plans through marketplaces created under the law, more preventive care for older Americans and more.
'It leaves the Democrats in a great position, because it elevates the possibility and concern that the ACA could disappear,' said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who has focused on health care as an election issue and is working for former vice president Joe Biden's campaign. 'It also removes a limited amount of credibility Trump was acquiring based on his rhetoric around prescription drugs. This shows he continues to be relentlessly focused on getting rid of the ACA.'
 Democratic congressional candidates are eager to redeploy their strategy from the 2018 midterm elections in which they gained the House majority by portraying themselves as the law's guardians.

'Here's what this means: This lawsuit still threatens to raise health-care costs and eliminate protections for Arizonans with preexisting conditions,' said Mark Kelly, a top Democratic Senate recruit challenging Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.). 
In strikingly similar language, Jaime Harrison, challenging Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), accused his opponent of 'trying to put the health of the millions of Americans that rely on the ACA at risk.'
The ruling 'is unifying for the Democrats,' Ponnuru said. In the presidential primary race, the candidates 'are obviously deeply divided about their own health-care plans. The voters are divided. . . . They are all united about this lawsuit.'

But in not striking down the entire ACA, the appellate ruling carves out space for Republicans to tell voters that nothing is changing for now. In practical terms, holding that the insurance mandate on individuals is unconstitutional has little immediate effect, coming two years after a Republican Congress voted to eliminate the financial penalty the law had imposed on people who failed to have insurance.
Since Wednesday's ruling, Republicans have been relatively quiet. Most who have spoken publicly have emphasized that no American's insurance is changing at the moment.
 In stopping short of voiding a law of more than 2,000 pages, the 5th Circuit spared Senate Republicans and Trump "" who has promised a replacement plan but not produced one "" of the responsibility of drafting new consumer protections they say they would preserve. 
'It helps when you can think through the potential problem, rather than trying to legislate with a gun to your head,' Holmes said.
Asked Thursday about the political impact of the court opinion, Kayleigh McEnany, the Trump campaign's national press secretary, did not answer directly. 'President Trump has lowered prescription drug costs, expanded health care choice, protected preexisting conditions, and removed the vastly unpopular and unconstitutional individual mandate,' she said in a statement. 'The American people recognize that President Trump's policies are working as Democrats threaten to deprive millions of Americans of their employer-provided health care.'
That reference to Medicare-for-all plans, championed by Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), is what makes the health-care issue 'a double-edged sword in 2020,' said Republican pollster Chris Wilson. 
'On the one hand, preexisting conditions were a winning issue for Democrats in 2018 and one many Republicans didn't answer as well as they should have,' he said. 'On the other hand, the big difference between 2018 and 2020 is that Medicare-for-all and government takeover of health care has moved from a fringe position. . . . So now Republicans have a way to hit back.'
 It enables Republicans, hoping to ward off Democratic attacks, to counter with claims that Democrats are the ones working to unravel the current health care system.
'The court not ruling on the constitutionality of Obamacare leaves all of this in play through next November,' Wilson said in an email.
Legal scholars said the limbo period probably will last well past the November elections, as Judge Reed O'Connor, of the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Texas, reconsiders whether the rest of the ACA can be considered legally distinct from the insurance requirement, the 5th Circuit reviews that ruling and the case almost certainly then goes to the Supreme Court.
The Democratic attorney general leading the fight to preserve the law hopes to shorten that limbo. 
'It's time to stop this uncertainty,' California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said Thursday, contending the 5th Circuit panel 'set a time bomb by sending it back to a lower court.'
Becerra told reporters that while he needs to confer with his 20 Democratic counterparts, he wants to ask the Supreme Court to take the case in time to hear and decide it by late spring. He acknowledged the high court already has decided on most of its cases for this term but contended it is not too late.
Amid the swirling politics, some questioned whether the timing of the 5th Circuit's opinion had a political element, since it was published during the House floor debate just before the chamber's vote to impeach Trump.
 'It's always hard to know,' said Nicholas Bagley, a pro-ACA University of Michigan law professor who said the opinion 'has the fingerprints of a partisan hit job.' He said the 5th Circuit panel could have been trying to finish its work before Christmas, or the two Republican-appointed judges in the majority could have been struggling over the opinion's legal reasoning or the Democratic-appointed judge could have been slow in writing her dissent.
Still, Bagley said, 'you release a highly partisan opinion on a day the country is distracted, it's reasonable to ask whether the timing was deliberate.'

 $50,000 from activity fees will be used to pay for speech on campus

GAINESVILLE, Fla. - An appearance by Donald Trump Jr. on the University of Florida campus Thursday night, billed as a ""keynote presentation"" and covered by student funds, drew protests by students objecting to what they called a campaign rally.
Trump and Kimberly Guilfoyle, his girlfriend and a senior adviser to his father's 2020 presidential campaign, will get $50,000 from student activity fees for their appearance.
In a critical swing state where Democrats and Republicans would like to capture the college-age vote, the event drew more attention than the usual campus speaker does. Hundreds of protesters had gathered more than an hour before the speeches.

""The $50K nothing burger,"" one protest sign read, with ""Whopper Junior"" written on its back side. 
As Trump and Guilfoyle spoke, touching on the usual campaign talking points such as immigration and low unemployment, a small but vocal group of protesters shouted ""Bull----, bull----."" Guilfoyle responded: ""I bet your parents are so proud of you."" She was soon supported by a larger pro-Trump crowd with cries of ""U.S.A.! U.S.A.!""
The speeches come as congressional committees in Washington are holding an impeachment investigation over President Trump's request to Ukrainian officials to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate, and his son Hunter, who once sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.
Trump, in his speech, referenced the Bidens. ""What would happen if Donald Trump Jr. sat on a board of a corrupt Ukrainian company? Do you think the media would have a problem with that?""
Protesters responded by yelling ""Lock him up! Lock him up!,"" meaning Trump Jr., forcing him to pause the speech. This was followed by chants of ""U.S.A.!"" When they died down, Trump said, ""I agree, they should probably lock up Joe.""
The event, which had the atmosphere of a Trump campaign rally, ended with competing chants of ""Four more years"" and ""Lock him up!""
Protesters outside continued the shouting as the Trump motorcade went by.

The event announcement had touted Trump as ""an innovator and leader in today's young business world"" and Guilfoyle as a ""sought after national speaker."" Guilfoyle is an attorney and former Fox News host.
Despite the pair's high profile in the Trump campaign, the students responsible for bringing them to campus said the visit was not about politics. ""This event is a campus speaking engagement, not a campaign event,"" said Henry Fair, who is in charge of the ACCENT Speakers Bureau. 
Tickets to the 843-seat auditorium were distributed without charge to students and claimed within hours. 
Bobby Mermer, co-president of Graduate Assistants United at UF, said many students felt they were being forced to support the couple's appearance. ""These are well-known campaign surrogates traveling the country for a political candidate,"" he said. 
Mermer said he wouldn't object if Trump and Guilfoyle spoke on campus without payment, as candidates have in the past. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a Democratic presidential contender, addressed an outdoor campaign rally on the campus in 2016 that was attended by 8,000. He was not paid. 
The speakers bureau is part of the university's Student Government Association, which independently oversees a budget of more than $21 million.

Student government president Michael Murphy, who approved allocating funds for the Trump speech, is the son of Republican lobbyist Dan Murphy. The elder Murphy works for the Washington firm BGR Group and has donated to President Trump's reelection campaign.
Michael Murphy posted photos of himself at Trump's inauguration, and the White House invited him to attend a Rose Garden ceremony in March when the president signed an executive order dealing with free speech on campus.
Trump and Guilfoyle spoke at Penn State this year, but that was part of the Campus Clash tour run by the conservative group Turning Point USA. 
Nancy Thomas, director of the Institute for Democracy and Higher Education at Tufts University, said it's no surprise the Trump campaign is hitting campuses.
""College-age students were really jazzed up for the 2018 election,"" Thomas said, and in the midterm elections, voter turnout in that age group rose 21 percent. ""I think you'll see an even bigger jump . . . in the presidential election.""Students opposed to Thursday's speech say hosting Trump and Guilfoyle was part of a larger effort.
""It's a pretty detailed strategy to pick the bluest area in North Florida and bring him here,"" said Emily Hyden, a 20-year-old junior majoring in international studies.

DUBUQUE, Iowa "" Cars with Kamala Harris bumper stickers lined the parking lot. Inside, a crowd of about 250 grew so quickly that staffers scrambled to add more chairs. 
By the time Sen. Amy Klobuchar took the stage inside a convention room overlooking the Mississippi River here, it was standing room only "" just as it had been during other stops in recent days as the senator from Minnesota crisscrossed the state. It was a welcome sign for a Democratic presidential candidate who has often struggled to attract the same kind of energy as her rivals. 
For months, the same four candidates have been at the top of the polls in this key early voting state: former vice president Joe Biden, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). But in this unusually fluid race, in which no candidate has a majority of support and many voters remain undecided, Klobuchar is drawing a second look. 
The Midwestern centrist with a message of experience and electability has attracted increasingly large crowds in recent weeks "" particularly in small towns that haven't gotten as much love from other candidates where many Democrats say they are still undecided. 
Her challenge is persuading Iowans desperate to defeat President Trump that she has a shot at winning.
Around the state, Democratic Party chairs have reported hearing more interest in her. And though she was at 6 percent support in the latest Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom poll of likely caucusgoers "" a distant fifth place "" the poll found that 39-percent of likely caucusgoers were still actively considering her, a number she and her staff have seized on as proof there is space for her campaign to grow.
'If I had to make a bet on the candidate most likely to have a late breakout into the top tier in Iowa, it would be Amy,' said Peter Leo, chairman of the Carroll County Democrats in northwestern Iowa, who recently endorsed Warren in the race.
Klobuchar is trying to capi tal ize on that attention. In the past two weeks, she has doubled her number of field offices to 20, with the possibility of more expansion. She has about 60 staffers on the ground, up from 40 in late August but about half the number reported by Warren, Biden and But tigieg. Still, she has made key hires, including Norm Sterzenbach, a former Iowa Democratic Party executive director and expert on caucus turnout who previously worked for former congressman Beto O'Rourke's campaign. 
Klobuchar's rise comes as moderate Democrats have reasserted their power in a presidential race that for months was dominated by sweeping liberal ideas, including Sanders's call for a political revolution and Warren's pitch for big, structural change. Democratic Party leaders and voters here have openly worried that expensive policies such as Medicare-for-all could prove to be too polarizing and lead to Trump's reelection next year.
Klobuchar has made the same unwavering argument for months on the campaign trail, describing Medicare-for-all as a 'pipe dream' and criticizing proposals such as free college as something the nation can't afford. She has criticized other Democrats in the 2020 race, arguing that their liberal policies will doom them in the general election. She presents herself, in contrast, as a political realist and, during her stump speech, often ticks through a litany of bills she has passed as a member of the Senate, many with the support of Republicans. 
'What I do is, I find common ground where I can find it. And then I stand my ground where I must,' she said in Chariton.
She has also used her background as a moderate senator from the Upper Midwest to argue that she can appeal to Trump voters, a particular obsession of voters here. 
In Dubuque, Klobuchar spoke in a room just down the hall from where Trump made one of his earliest campaign appearances in Iowa. That 2015 rally attracted some 3,000 people, who laughed and cheered at a speech in which Trump railed on Mexico, China and even Elton John.
While local Democrats have reported high enthusiasm leading up to the caucuses, some have pointed to that rally, one of the largest in the city's history, questioning whether anyone in the party's 2020 field genuinely has the ability to win back those voters who backed Trump three years ago.
Klobuchar highlighted her background as a pragmatic lawmaker willing to cross party lines, saying it made her a 'perfect match for Donald Trump.' She was unsparing in her critique of the president, calling him a 'whiner' for his recent decision to leave a NATO conference early after world leaders mocked him. 
She argued that Democrats can't overlook that many Americans still support him and that it is her party's job to appeal to those people in a deeper way, invoking gut checks on decency, patriotism and values. 'I don't agree with some of the candidates who think we should never talk about Donald Trump because I think we have to give people a reason and explain why we are better than him,' she said.
Still, Klobuchar faces an uphill battle in coming weeks. While Buttigieg has been on the defensive, fending off criticism of his corporate work and questions about his electability, he continues to soak up much of the oxygen in the race. Last weekend, he drew massive crowds across eastern Iowa, including 3,000 at a rally in Coralville, a Democratic stronghold.
Klobuchar faces other challenges, too. Her moderate appeal means she'll struggle to draw the party's liberal voters. Her past as a prosecutor has made her candidacy a tough sell for nonwhite voters. And a January impeachment trial would keep the senator in Washington during a crucial moment. 
And though voters at Klobuchar's campaign stops cheered, often wildly, as she made her case for how to take on Trump and why she believes she is the best candidate to do so, many weren't quite ready to back her campaign. Walking out of the events, several voters took commit-to-caucus cards but said they weren't ready to sign.
'I'm almost there,' a woman told Klobuchar in Chariton last week. 'I really like you.'
Lisa Plein, a government worker from Dubuque, said she was leaning toward Buttigieg but also liked Klobuchar. But she worried about her electability. She recalled a recent conversation she had with her father, who railed against the idea of a female president. 'I was like, 'Dad, you're saying this to your daughter?' ' Plein said. 'But I also realized there's a huge group of people who think like that . . . and how do you overcome that? . . . Defeating Trump is so important.'
Klobuchar regularly nods to concerns about gender. In her stump speech, she argues a woman can beat Trump. 'Nancy Pelosi does it every day,' she said during the November Democratic debate.
But her more immediate dilemma isn't how she deals with the general election "" it's how she makes it out of the primary. Across the state, Iowans regularly speak of how much they like Klobuchar. 'The ultimate compliment,' she often jokingly says, comes from Iowans who say they like her so much that she's still in their top three.
Last week, Klobuchar, who is known for having a dry, self-deprecating sense of humor on the trail, sounded a little more anxious in her efforts to be more than just someone Iowans really like. 'We're down to less than 60 days, so don't say, 'You're in my top three,' ' she told the group in Chariton. With a smile and a voice dripping with mock exasperation, she pleaded, 'Just make a decision!'

One of the star witnesses in the trial of political operative and longtime President Trump friend Roger Stone took the stand Thursday, starkly contradicting Stone's under-oath testimony to Congress about efforts to learn about Democratic emails hacked by Russia.
Punctuating his testimony with jokes, dated pop-culture references and offers to do impressions, comedian and former radio host Randy Credico told jurors that - contrary to what Stone told lawmakers - he was not Stone's secret back channel to the anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks, which published the emails that authorities say were hacked and ultimately released to benefit Trump's campaign.
Stone's trial is the last case filed by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III in his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Investigators had initially been exploring Stone as they examined a possible conspiracy between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign.
Two days of testimony have shed new light on why investigators were keenly suspicious of the campaign, and of Stone in particular. 
Prosecutors have said that phone records show Stone and Trump talked on key dates of WikiLeaks' actions. Prosecutors also spotlighted text messages and emails from Stone and his associates that, they contend, seem to show efforts to get in touch with the group. 
Mueller's team concluded there was insufficient evidence to establish a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. Stone has pleaded not guilty to charges he made false statements to Congress and tampered with a witness: Credico. 
Prosecutors alleged Stone was motivated to lie out of a desire to protect the Trump campaign from embarrassment. The lies had real impact, denying the House Intelligence Committee access to Stone's communications, former FBI special agent Michelle Taylor testified.

On Thursday, prosecutors sought to prove to jurors that Stone had lied and obstructed - comparing documentary evidence to Stone's recorded words to the House committee, and displaying inflammatory messages that Stone sent to Credico.

""You are a rat. A stoolie. You backstab your friends,"" Stone wrote in April 2018, adding later, ""I am so ready. Let's get it on. Prepare to die. . . .""
As Credico testified, Stone, 67, stared impassively at him - at times tilting his head back, and resting his right elbow at the defense table. Credico, by contrast, joked with Judge Amy Berman Jackson, at one point offering to do an impression of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, at another saying he was tempted to mimic Marlon Brando. 
Stone, a self-professed ""dirty trickster"" since the 1970s, has employed a defense that takes advantage of his unsavory reputation: Don't believe me or anyone else. Bruce S. Rogow, his attorney, has sought to get witnesses to concede that what Stone claimed about interactions with WikiLeaks did not always prove to be true.
Credico said he was often ""bluffing"" in his conversations with Stone, and assumed Stone was lying himself. But after the congressional testimony, Credico repeatedly told Stone that Stone had committed ""perjury,"" and urged him to correct the record.
Among the alleged false claims Stone made to Congress was that he had no documentary evidence of his conversations about WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange. Zeroing in on Credico, prosecutors sought to show that was false. 
""On the day that Roger Stone testified to the committee and said his intermediary 'was not an email guy,' how many written communications did Roger Stone have with Randy Credico?"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Kravis asked Taylor, the former FBI agent, in court.
""Seventy-two,"" she responded, citing Stone's phone and text records. 
Taylor also presented to jurors a chart of Stone's phone conversations with Trump campaign officials from January to November 2016. The chart showed 25 calls with campaign chairman Paul Manafort; 20 with his deputy, Rick Gates; and two with Trump himself. 
Credico flatly rejected another claim that Stone made to Congress: that Credico was his secret intermediary to WikiLeaks and Assange. Credico said the only time in 2016 that he spoke to Assange was in an Aug. 25 interview on his radio show. 
Credico said he didn't even try to get information on future WikiLeaks releases because, ""Julian Assange is not going to tell me about future releases."" He conceded he promised to reach out to WikiLeaks on Stone's behalf, but testified that he never did. 
Prosecutors showed jurors a bevy of messages from Stone to Credico, including one from Nov. 17, 2017, about how he should respond to the congressional committee's investigation to try to bolster that case. ""Stonewall it, plead the fifth, do anything to save the plan,"" the text read. 
Taylor testified that Stone twice in conversations with Credico invoked the character of Frank Pentangeli, a character from ""The Godfather: Part II."" Stone's attorney has said the request was to act out a scene because of Credico's ability as an impressionist. 
The scene is one in which Pentangeli is supposed to appear as a witness in a Senate hearing into the Corleone organized crime family, but sees the family's godfather, Michael Corleone, enter the room with Pentangeli's brother. His demeanor changes from cocky to somber.
""When he's being questioned, Mr. Pentangeli is asked his affiliation with the Corleone family, and he says he doesn't know anything about it,"" Taylor testified. 
Credico seemed to take the moment in good fun, claiming he specialized in an impression of Vito Corleone, a different Godfather character, not Frank Pentangeli. 
Credico said he did not recall ever doing the bit for Stone.
As court ended for the day and the judge sent jurors out, she instructed them not to go home and watch the movie.

Biden, Sanders, Warren
post top numbers among
five potential matchups


One year out from the 2020 election, President Trump trails some potential Democratic rivals in head-to-head matchups, with his national support level currently fixed at about 40 percent, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll.
The new poll highlights the degree to which most of the country already has made a judgment about the president's performance and their voting preferences next year. Among the 39 percent of registered voters who approve of Trump's job performance, Trump is winning at least 95 percent support against each of five possible Democratic opponents. But among the 58 percent of voters who disapprove of Trump, he receives no more than 7 percent support.
Former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) run strongest against the president nationally, with Biden leading by 17 points (56 percent to 39 percent), Warren by 15 points (55 percent to 40 percent) and Sanders by 14 points (55 percent to 41 percent). 
South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), the other two Democrats tested against Trump, also lead the president among registered voters, with Buttigieg up 52 percent to 41 percent, and Harris ahead 51 percent to 42 percent.

The poll reflects national findings; other surveys in the states expected to play an outsize role in the 2020 contest have shown tighter races, particularly in parts of the upper Midwest that Trump flipped from Democrats in 2016.


Nonetheless, the national results represent a shift away from Trump since the summer, when only Biden had a clear advantage over the incumbent. With Republicans and Democrats mostly locked in on their voting intentions, the biggest difference between the results from July and those in the new poll is that independents have moved in the direction of the Democratic candidates.
One wild card is any impact that impeachment proceedings might have on public attitudes. The current poll was completed just before the House voted largely along party lines to formalize the inquiry. 
As the process moves to public hearings in the House and what many now expect to be articles of impeachment against the president and then a trial in the Senate, both sides will be watching for cracks in either Trump's or his challengers' coalitions.

National margins of the size in the new survey, if they were to hold for another year, would probably result in a popular-vote victory for the Democrats, possibly larger than the nearly 3 million-vote margin that Hillary Clinton earned over Trump in 2016. 
That means Trump's path to victory next year is to replicate the electoral college majority he fashioned by narrowly winning Florida, North Carolina and three states that had long been Democratic presidential strongholds - Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin - while easily winning Ohio and Iowa, which had been swing states in recent elections.
State-specific polls often have shown Trump's job approval rating higher than it is nationally, pointing to the challenges for Democrats in their efforts to win back the White House next year. Although the president is not in a comfortable position heading into the election, Democrats still could have limited options and some obstacles to winning an electoral college majority regardless of the popular vote.
Trump is running behind the Democratic candidates despite generally positive assessments of the economy. A plurality (44 percent) of Americans say the economy has gotten better since Trump took office, twice the number who say it has gotten worse (22 percent). About a third say the economy has stayed about the same. 
Of those who say it has gotten better, more than 3 in 4 give Trump a great deal or a good amount of credit. Of those who say it has gotten worse, more than 8 in 10 say Trump deserves the blame.
Offsetting the benefits of the economy, Trump has negative views on a series of attributes. Just over 3 in 10, or 31 percent, say he is honest and trustworthy, tying the lowest result of his presidency. A slightly larger 36 percent say he has the kind of personality and temperament it takes to serve effectively as president. In both cases, just under 2 in 3 voters disagreed. Those findings are almost identical to results from a survey in October 2016, shortly before he won the presidency.
On other questions, 37 percent say Trump understands the problems ""of people like you,"" 40 percent say he is good at making political deals and 42 percent say he has brought needed change to Washington.
Overall, these results are low for an incumbent president, but Trump proved he could overcome them in 2016 and his allies think he can do so again in 2020.
Thus far in the campaign, Trump has worked to rally his past supporters rather than try to extend his reach beyond already-loyal elements of the electorate. But the poll shows he is faring worse now than in 2016 election polls among non-college white voters as well as political independents, both groups that helped power his victory. In 2016, he won non-college whites by a 36-point margin, according to a Pew Research Center analysis, but he leads Biden by half that - 18 points - among registered voters in this group in the latest Post-ABC poll. 
Trump narrowly won self-identified independents in 2016 (46 percent to 42 percent), according to the National Election Pool exit poll, but in the latest Post-ABC poll he trails Biden by 17 points among this group. 
Trump also receives less unified support among Republican voters - 80 percent in the current poll compared with 88 percent in the 2016 exit poll. Based on recent elections, Trump would expect to gain support among Republicans through the course of a reelection campaign. 

As other markers, including fundraising and activism, have shown, voter intensity is high one year out from the election. Roughly 8 in 10 adults say they will definitely vote in the 2020 election and it appears to make little difference whether the Democratic nominee is Biden, Warren or Sanders. Similarly large majorities of Democrats and Republicans say they will definitely vote, regardless of the Democratic challenger. 

But people ages 18 to 29 are slightly more likely to say they could skip the vote if the nominee were Biden or Warren - 34 percent and 38 percent, respectively - than if the nominee is Sanders (22 percent). Voters in other age groups say they are less likely to skip voting next year. 
Biden builds his national margin over Trump with the support of female voters. He and Trump are running evenly among men, at 47 percent. But Biden is swamping the president among women, 64 percent to 33 percent. Every Democrat tested gets at least 59 percent of women. 
Among whites, all five Democrats are winning among those with college degrees, helping to blunt Trump's advantage among those without college degrees. Among nonwhites, the Democratic candidates are running far ahead of the president. 
The Post-ABC poll was conducted by telephone Oct. 27-30 among a random national sample of 1,003 adults, 65 percent of whom were reached on cellphones and 35 percent on landlines. The margin of sampling error for results among adults is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points; the error margin is four points among the sample of 876 registered voters.

| Jump to first hitSen. Bernie Sanders released a proposal Thursday to legalize marijuana across the country and expunge criminal convictions related to the drug, embracing an overhaul of federal laws on the eve of a presidential forum expected to renew the debate on race, drugs and police violence.

Sanders becomes the latest Democratic White House aspirant to issue a plan for more tolerant drug laws, a shift from past presidential elections when Democrats, like Republicans, often promoted more toughness. Changing attitudes toward drug crimes, and a growing number of states legalizing cannabis, have ushered in a primary contest where ideas once seen as provocative have become mainstream.
Sanders's plan, which aims to overhaul an approach he argues has unfairly hurt minorities, calls for using executive power to reclassify marijuana as a dangerous controlled substance and passing legislation to permanently legalize the drug. It would direct federal and state authorities to review, vacate and expunge past marijuana convictions.
""We're going to legalize marijuana and end the horrifically destructive war on drugs,"" the Vermont independent said in a written statement. ""It has disproportionately targeted people of color and ruined the lives of millions of Americans.""
In his 2016 campaign, Sanders struggled to persuade African American voters to support him, and many instead gravitated to Hillary Clinton. He has taken steps in his second run to improve his standing, but so far there is little indication his outreach has made a significant impact in states with large minority populations.
Sanders released his marijuana plan a day before the start of the Second Step Presidential Justice Forum at Benedict College, a historically black institution in Columbia, S.C. South Carolina is an important early nominating state where African Americans are expected to account for a majority of Democratic primary voters. Sanders and eight other Democrats are scheduled to speak at the forum over the next three days.
President Trump is also slated to appear, taking the stage on Friday. He will participate in a symposium called ""The Conservative Case for Criminal Justice Reform,"" according to the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center, which is sponsoring the event.
Trump has presented himself as a champion of criminal justice reform, and in December he signed the First Step Act, a bipartisan prison overhaul law. The ""second step"" in the forum's title refers to a push to move beyond that law.
While criminal justice reform is important to many black voters, African American leaders have condemned the president's sometimes racist rhetoric, and it is not clear what kind of reception he will receive Friday.
Most recent polls show Sanders, who recently resumed his campaign activities after taking time off to recuperate from a heart attack, in third place behind Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and former vice president Joe Biden. His two top rivals have also proposed sweeping changes to the nation's marijuana laws.
Biden's proposal is less far-reaching than those of Sanders's and Warren's. His plan, which he rolled out in July, would decriminalize marijuana use and expunge prior convictions for it. Biden's plan advocates legalizing marijuana for medical purposes but would leave decisions on recreational use largely up to the states.
Biden would reclassify cannabis as a Schedule II drug, rather than Schedule I, so researchers would be allowed to study it.
Warren, like Sanders, supports legalizing marijuana and erasing past convictions.
Eleven states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana use to some degree, and many more allow it for medicinal purposes. Increasingly, prominent Democrats, along with some Republicans, have become outspoken advocates of relaxing criminal penalties for using the drug.
Former House speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), for example, joined the board of a cannabis company last year and favors legalization.
But some divides have remained. In the early days of the Trump presidency, his administration signaled an intent to crack down on marijuana under then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. More recently, Trump said he would leave it to states to decide whether to legalize the drug.
""We're going to see what's going on,"" Trump said in late August when asked whether the federal government would legalize marijuana during his presidency. ""It's a very big subject. And right now we're allowing states to make that decision. And a lot of states are making that decision.""
Trump administration officials have raised alarms about marijuana use among pregnant women and young people. In August, Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the drug ""carries more risk than ever.""

The marijuana industry, however, has become lucrative as more states have legalized it. Sanders, who is running on a platform of curtailing income inequality and reining in the power of big companies, says he would create provisions to prevent large corporations from dominating the market.
His plan would ban tobacco companies from participating in the industry, for example, and would offer resources for people to start cooperatives and nonprofits.
The Sanders plan would also use taxes on marijuana sales to help promote minority businesses. It would do away with regulations requiring drug tests to receive public benefits, prevent officials from removing residents of public housing for marijuana use, and prohibit products and labels that target young people.

Beset by impeachment inquiry, he aims to show voters he's hard at work


PALM BEACH, Fla. "" As Democrats in Congress push to impeach him, President Trump has toured a manufacturing plant in Texas, boasted about economic gains and signed numerous bills. He served turkey to U.S. troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving and grieved with the families of fallen service members at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware.
And next week, Trump is scheduled to jet to London to meet with European allies and be received at Buckingham Palace by Queen Elizabeth II. 
Sure, Trump has been consumed by the impeachment proceedings, popping off daily, if not hourly, about what he dubs a 'hoax.' But he and his aides also have staged photo opportunities and public events designed to showcase the president on the job "" a strategy one year out from the election to convince the American people that he is hard at work for them at the same time that Democrats are trying to remove him from office.
'I'm working my ass off,' Trump told a thunderous rally crowd of roughly 20,000 on Tuesday night in Sunrise, Fla. He added: 'The failed Washington establishment is trying to stop me because I'm fighting for you and because we're winning. It's very simple.'
Trump is taking a page out of the Clinton playbook. Then-President Bill Clinton survived his 1998 impeachment in part because the economy was roaring and because he appeared to many voters to be relentlessly focused on doing the business of the American people. When Clinton left office in 2001, Gallup measured his job approval rating at 66 percent.
Clinton had a built-in advantage that Trump does not enjoy: popularity. Throughout his second term, Clinton's approval rating hovered in the high 50s and 60s, whereas Trump's has been mired below 50 percent.
Still, Clinton's experience has been instructive to Trump, who recently met in the Oval Office with former Clinton strategist Mark Penn, who counseled the president to focus on governing and travel frequently.

David Axelrod, who served as senior adviser in the Obama White House, said Trump's strategy has been 'smart politics,' though he noted that it remains to be seen whether the famously undisciplined president will sustain it through a likely Senate impeachment trial.
'The images of the president with cheering troops and performing other magisterial and ministerial functions of the office are a way of signifying that he is still in command, doing the job, rather than on the run,' Axelrod said.
Trump interrupted his Thanksgiving vacation here in Florida with a 36-hour trip to Afghanistan, where he made a surprise visit to Bagram air base and announced that he intended to draw down forces in America's longest war and had resumed peace negotiations with the Taliban after he had scuttled them in September.
Trump rallied about 1,500 uniformed military personnel packed into a hangar at Bagram, many of them cheering at the presence of the commander in chief, and was joined onstage by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who did not hold back in his praise.
'President Trump, people talked a lot about bin Laden, but what you did to eliminate al-Baghdadi "" who was an organizer and not a talker "" is a much greater accomplishment. Congratulations,' Ghani said, referring to the killings of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011 and of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi earlier this month.
Trump has succeeded in drawing plaudits from other validators as well. Last Wednesday, during a day of blockbuster hearings in Congress "" including U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland's testimony implicating Trump in a quid pro quo with Ukraine "" the president was in Austin visiting a factory where Apple's Mac Pro desktop computers are manufactured.

Apple chief executive Tim Cook led Trump on the tour and credited the president with helping revive American manufacturing. When Trump asked, 'What would you say about our economy compared to everybody else?' Cook replied, 'I think we have the strongest economy in the world right now.'
Trump drew some criticism for the visit: He took credit for opening the factory when in fact Apple computers have been assembled there since 2013, three years before Trump's election.
Regardless, the images of Trump outside of Washington, walking a factory floor and showcasing a tech product, delivered the intended message, in the estimation of Republican public relations professionals.
'This is the right strategy for the president: Show the American people that he is focused on doing his job while Washington Democrats chase the great white whale of impeachment,' said Michael Steel, a former senior aide to former House speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio).
Trump likes to brag about how much he is getting done. 'We're doing things that no president has ever done before, and you've got to be very, very happy,' he told supporters at the Sunrise rally.
But other than the strong economy and the successful Baghdadi raid, Trump has had few tangible achievements in recent months. His legislative agenda has all but stalled since Democrats took control of the House at the beginning of the year, and the trade agreement his administration negotiated with Canada and Mexico hangs in the balance as it awaits congressional approval.
'There's a huge difference between photo ops that are designed to give people the impression that work is getting done and really doing the work and actually demonstrating results,' said Don Baer, a former Clinton White House adviser. 'The Trump White House is going to have to figure out how it begins to put real results on the table for the public in terms of things it's doing instead of just telling people that things are getting done.'

Jason Miller, a former Trump campaign adviser who has been recording a pro-Trump radio show and podcast, 'War Room: Impeachment,' said it is critical that the president show voters that he is focused on doing his job "" especially as his reelection campaign intensifies.
'President Trump is a born leader, so these events come naturally for him, and looking to 2020, can anyone really imagine Elizabeth Warren opening an Apple factory, Bernie Sanders greeting troops overseas, or Joe Biden negotiating with foreign leaders without Hunter there cutting side deals?' Miller said, taking shots at three of the leading Democratic presidential candidates, including a reference to Biden's son, that echo the message of the president's campaign toward Trump's potential 2020 rivals. Hunter Biden has been criticized for his foreign business dealings but has denied wrongdoing.
Lacking a bevy of big achievements of late, Trump has striven to make a show of whatever he can. On Monday, he invited journalists into the Oval Office to observe him signing the Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture Act.
The law revises criminal penalties for creating or distributing videos or images depicting animal torture. The bill did not require much of a lift "" it passed the House by voice vote and the Senate by unanimous consent "" but the president celebrated its passage nonetheless.
'This is something that should've happened a long time ago and it didn't,' Trump said. 'I ask the same question I asked for another bill that we just signed: Why hasn't this happened a long time ago? And I give you the same answer: because Trump wasn't president.'

Critics cited Uygur's past statements demeaning women and minorities

MANCHESTER, N.H. "" Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) abruptly retracted his endorsement of controversial congressional candidate Cenk Uygur on Friday, making a rare concession to critics who were angered by Uygur's explicit and demeaning comments about women and minorities in past years.
In a statement issued about 24 hours after he endorsed Uygur, Sanders said: 'Our movement is bigger than any one person. I hear my grassroots supporters who were frustrated and understand their concerns. Cenk today said he is rejecting all endorsements for his campaign, and I retract my endorsement.' 
The move capped an unusual episode that gained attention as Sanders embarked on a presidential campaign swing through the pivotal primary states of New Hampshire and Iowa. It was an embarrassing detour for a candidate who has been gaining steam in the polls, and it caused some frustration inside the Sanders campaign. 
The furor started Thursday when Uygur posted a statement from Sanders on Twitter saying the senator had decided to support the California candidate because 'I know he will serve ordinary people, not powerful special interests. He is a voice that we desperately need in Congress.'
Many Democrats and liberal activists quickly expressed dismay at Sanders's action, and by Friday morning the anger was evident in many corners of the party. Still, Sanders made no mention of Uygur at a campaign event in Manchester on Friday afternoon, where he was introduced by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). 
But between campaign stops, the Sanders team issued the statement pulling back the endorsement, not long after Uygur issued his own declaration that he would not be 'accepting' endorsements. 
Sanders is generally proud to hold fast to his positions in the face of criticism from detractors and sometimes even his own staff. But this time the attacks came not from conservatives or centrists but figures as unabashedly liberal as Sanders himself, and they arose as he and his rivals are battling for support from Democratic women.
'I am tired of misogyny on the left,' journalist and author Jill Filipovic wrote on Twitter after word of Sanders's endorsement spread. 'I am tired of being told I am imagining misogyny on the left. I am tired of being told 'progressive values' mean we have to overlook misogyny on the left. I am tired of gender equality apparently not being a 'progressive value.' '



The Wrap, an entertainment news website, previously unearthed blog posts Uygur wrote years ago, including one in 2000 that said: 'Obviously, the genes of women are flawed. They are poorly designed creatures who do not want to have sex nearly as often as needed for the human race to get along peaceably and fruitfully.'
Other comments were more graphic, and as recently as 2013, Uygur posted crass commentary on Twitter about women's bodies.
Uygur has apologized for his past comments and says he is a different person now, but many liberal activists remain troubled by them. Justice Democrats, a group Uygur helped found to support liberals running for Congress, ousted him in 2017 when the remarks were disclosed.
Uygur has been very supportive of Sanders in recent years, and some Democrats interpreted the endorsement as the loyalty Sanders is often inclined to show to his staunchest backers. 

Uygur has gained a following in recent years through his online news and commentary show 'The Young Turks.' He often attacks Democrats from the left, arguing that they are too timid in standing up to Republicans, an outlook that meshes well with Sanders's. 
'The Young Turks' is popular with many Sanders supporters, and Uygur has featured the senator on his program and covered him favorably. On Thursday, Uygur called Sanders a 'legend' and thanked him for his support. 


Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign faced criticism for not treating some of its female employees well, and the candidate has apologized for that.
The senator is also known for a certain irascibility, but since his emergence from a hospital stay after a heart attack two months ago, Sanders has appeared more relaxed on the campaign trail, and his campaign has scored some successes and strengthened in the polls.
In some ways that made this misstep more notable. Uygur is running in the 25th Congressional District in Southern California, a seat that opened up when Rep. Katie Hill (D) resigned amid an ethics inquiry into allegations that she'd had an intimate relationship with a staff member in her office.
Assemblywoman Christy Smith (D) has jumped into the race for the district north of Los Angeles, receiving the endorsement of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other party leaders, as well as liberal groups including Emily's List.
Several Republicans are also expected to run for the seat, including George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign aide who was ensnared in the investigation of Russian election interference. 
A Pelosi representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday, but others in the party did not hold back in their opposition to Sanders's initial endorsement. 
'Team Bernie chose to endorse an open misogynist,' tweeted David Atkins, a regional director of the California Democratic Party.
The executive board of the Hollywood chapter of the National Organization for Women posted a statement calling on Sanders to disavow Uygur and saying the congressional hopeful's 'hateful and sexist rhetoric has no place within the women's movement or our government.'
The California Women's List, which supports Democratic female candidates who advocate abortion rights, also voiced dissatisfaction, saying in a statement that it was 'disappointed in Senator Sanders's endorsement of Cenk Uygur, a candidate who has repeatedly used misogynistic, racist, and homophobic language. This endorsement appears to go against Senator Sanders' platform and role as a leader in the progressive movement.' 
The backlash prompted Uygur to issue a statement saying he appreciated the endorsements of Sanders and others.
'Their stance took real courage in the face of the corporate media and Democratic establishment onslaught,' he wrote on Twitter. But he added, 'I will not be beholden to corporations, lobbyists, or special interest groups and I will not stand by while those groups attack my political allies. That's why I have decided that I will not be accepting any endorsements.'
Sanders traveled Friday in New Hampshire accompanied by Omar, a member of the 'Squad' of four liberal congresswomen. Three of the four are supporting Sanders.
Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a national co-chair of the Sanders campaign, also withdrew his endorsement of Uygur on Friday. Khanna wrote on Twitter that Uygur had asked him to do so. 
Some Democrats have started to wonder about Sanders's broader strategy when it comes to congressional campaign endorsements. Sean McElwee, a co-founder of the liberal group Data for Progress, asked why Sanders had gone in for Uygur while staying quiet about left-wing candidate Jessica Cisneros in her challenge to moderate Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Tex.).
'What's baffling to me about this endorsement is that there is a progressive woman taking on the most right-wing corporate Democrat in the House who could use some backup,' McElwee said.

Democrats fear their top contenders leave much for Trump to exploit
The top fundraiser in the Democratic presidential field was hospitalized for a heart attack, the longtime polling leader and his son sit at the center of an impeachment inquiry, and the one candidate with clear momentum faces persistent doubts among some party leaders that she is too liberal to win the general election.
With breathtaking speed, the events of the past two weeks have created huge uncertainty for the candidates who have dominated the Democratic nomination race, shaking a party desperate to defeat President Trump next year and deeply fearful of any misstep that risks reelecting a president many Democrats see as dangerously unfit for office.
Concerns have risen in recent days that the potential Democratic slate has been weakened by events largely out of the candidates' control. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) promised a speedy return to the campaign trail after leaving the hospital Friday, but it was unclear whether the 78-year-old would be able to replicate his previously frenetic travel schedule. Former vice president Joe Biden, who has spent most of the race as the leader in the polls, has faced daily attacks from Trump over largely unfounded allegations about his son Hunter's foreign business dealings, highlighting a potential vulnerability for the candidate many saw as the best hope for beating Trump.
""This is crazier than most. It's the normal twists and turns - on steroids,"" said former senator Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.). ""Anything can happen. Anything can happen.""
Interviews with more than two dozen Democratic leaders, top strategists and former elected officials revealed that most are still holding out judgment about how - or how much - the events will shift the race.
But they point to several worrying factors, including questions about whether Biden is equipped to mount an effective defense against Trump's attacks and whether the surging Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) would alienate moderate voters and donors if she were the nominee. Some fear that Sanders's health problems put a spotlight on the advanced age of the top contenders, all of whom are in their 70s. Others expressed skepticism that any Democrat would be able to compete against Trump's unmatched ability to shift the public's focus.
""We need to be proposing an alternative, and I think it is going to be very difficult to get any of that through when we are talking about impeachment,"" said former senator Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), who lost her reelection in 2018 in the face of high Trump popularity in her state. "" 'My ideas are better than your ideas' has now been eclipsed by the news of the day.""
The shifting dynamic has already altered campaign strategies, as some trailing candidates focus on early-voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, where they can more easily avoid the nationally broadcast din of impeachment news. But for the front-running trio, the events of the past two weeks have served as a public test of how they would handle crises in a general election.
Trump's early and fierce focus on Biden - which includes public requests for foreign leaders to investigate his family - has challenged the former vice president to prove his ability to fight back.
""This is not about me; this is not about my son. There's not a shred of evidence of anything done was wrong,"" Biden told reporters Friday. ""Let's focus on the problem. Focus on this man. What he's doing that no president has ever done. No president.""
But there are signs that Trump's attacks are having an effect, even among prospective Biden supporters. One Biden volunteer, Marcie Lammers, who showed up to his Las Vegas event last month wearing a Biden T-shirt, said the backlash to the impeachment news was clear in the phone calls she has been making for her candidate.
""I know it's getting in the way,"" she said of the impeachment talk and Trump's accusations about the Bidens' actions involving Ukraine. ""When I do the phone banking, at first people said 'Well, I'm thinking about Joe or I'm leaning toward Joe.' Now, the people that do pick up the phone, they say, 'Well if he wants to collect money, why doesn't he just get it from Ukraine?' ""
The danger for Biden, strategists say, is that voters look past the details of Trump's charges of corruption against him, many of which have been debunked, and fear the impact. Biden sought the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had previously investigated a company where his son worked - but he was carrying out U.S. policy with the support of other Western governments, not intervening on behalf of his family. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing as part of investigation into his Ukrainian employer, which was dormant at the time his father sought the dismissal.
""Whether it is true or not, you have to take it seriously that it is something that might stick, even if there is no there there,"" said Glen Caplin, who served as a top presidential campaign adviser for Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who ended her run in August. 
""We saw it in 2016,"" he added, referring to charges of corruption that Trump leveled against former secretary of state Hillary Clinton.
At the same time, several party strategists say Biden still has an opportunity to take advantage of the attention Trump has directed at him. The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee have announced $10 million in spending on campaign ads that misleadingly attack Biden for his work in Ukraine. Biden has begun airing an ad that directly takes on Trump and accuses him of trying to engineer the selection of the Democratic nominee.
""Biden's best positioning is when it is him versus Trump in the primary,"" said David Plouffe, a top adviser to Barack Obama's two presidential campaigns who now hosts the Campaign HQ podcast. ""It's an opportunity to show people: 'Trump is afraid of me. I can stand up to him.' I would seize that.""
One factor raising alarm is that Biden raised only $15.2 million over the past three months, putting him in fourth place among the candidates and well behind Sanders and Warren, who have built grass-roots fundraising networks.
""That'll be the discussion. He's the front-runner. Why is he not raising more?"" said Terry McAuliffe, a former Virginia governor and a prolific fundraiser who ran the Democratic National Committee. ""This is an opportunity with everything going on. Get yourself on the news and do it.""
The Trump onslaught has revealed growing frustration among some Biden supporters that top party officials - as well as some of his rivals - have not done more to rally behind him during what they view as a moment of crisis fomented by Trump.
""I'm disappointed in a lot of the leaders in our party who are allowing the GOP to do what they do very well,"" said Harold A. Schaitberger, president of the International Association of Firefighters and a fierce Biden backer. ""They have their guns blazing. They have a great coordinated plan. The basic Democratic comment is just crickets. . . . All I know is our side better learn to fight better.""
Democratic leaders and strategists also expressed concern that Sanders's recent illness could raise fresh questions about the septuagenarian polling leaders. Warren, 70, is the youngest, and both Biden, 76, and Sanders, 78, would be the oldest president ever to take office if they won.
Sanders started the week on a high note, announcing a significant third-quarter fundraising haul of $25.3 million, larger than every other Democratic candidate. But hours later, he was hospitalized for treatment of a blocked artery. He was released Friday but is taking an unknown amount of time off. It remains unclear whether he will hold events before the next debate on Oct. 15.
""The age issue was not so much a health-related issue, but rather more one about generational appeal,"" said Donna Bojarsky, a California Democratic consultant who has donated money to the campaigns of Sens. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Cory Booker (N.J.). ""Now, because of Senator Sanders, maybe the issue will come up more.""
The three top-polling candidates have promised to release medical records before the Iowa caucuses, but the Sanders campaign was not fully transparent about his condition. The announcement by his doctors of the heart attack, in a campaign- issued statement, came three days after he arrived at the hospital.
The flurry of impeachment news and distractions for Sanders and Biden have accrued so far to Warren's benefit, disrupting other Democrats' efforts to more directly challenge her ideas and background. 
Warren took the lead in several state and national polls last month, and she is widely seen as building the most accomplished campaign.
""My sense is the person who is getting the best of this is Elizabeth Warren. She's not being attacked. And she's raising money,"" said Mitch Landrieu, the former mayor of New Orleans. But any pause in the scrutiny she may face is likely to be temporary, he added.
""She has a plan for everything except for how to beat Donald Trump. That needs to get tested,"" Landrieu said. ""She says she can do all these things. There's a thing called political reality. . . . Aspiration is wonderful, but you can't eat aspiration for lunch and send your kids to college on it. That's a fundamental decision that Democratic primary voters need to make a decision on.""
The now-overshadowed attacks focused on whether Warren was the person she claimed to be, and whether her plans, including Medicare-for-all, would alienate general-election voters.
Biden said Warren was not being candid with voters about her policy plans, and his aides had pointed to the vice president's release of decades of tax returns, highlighting the years when Warren did corporate legal work before entering public office. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has called Warren ""extremely evasive"" about the details of her health plans. Both Harris's and Sanders's campaign staffs have pointed out that Warren, who boasts regularly of her grass-roots fundraising model, transferred $10 million into her campaign, including money she had solicited from wealthy donors during her Senate efforts.
""What has impressed me about her is she creates her own weather. She has risen in the polls on her own, not pushing off against somebody else,"" said Jennifer Palmieri, a top strategist for Hillary Clinton in 2016. ""I hear from a lot of campaigns that she is going to have to answer questions now. Well, I don't know. She gets asked questions all the time. I'm not sure that confronting her is going to have the impact that other campaigns want.""
As Warren has steadily marched upward in the polls, the reality that she could become the nominee has unsettled some of the party's top donors, who worry that she would hand the race to Trump. If it starts to look like Warren will win the party's nomination, a longtime Democratic bundler said, ""there will be efforts to stop that.""
""Right now, they think Joe Biden stands between us and Elizabeth/Bernie - and to defeat in 2020,"" said the bundler, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. ""So if he [Biden] doesn't measure up, that's where you start to feel angst in the donor community.""
Another major Democratic donor, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, said he and other donors seeking a moderate as a nominee have ""zero interest in coming around to Elizabeth Warren."" If she's the nominee, ""we can't vote for her or Donald Trump"" and would sit out the election, he said.
The donor also expressed worries that if Warren is the nominee, her presence would ruin any Democratic chances to win the Senate, because voters would perceive having a Republican majority as ""the only way to keep her in check"" as president.
For the rest of the Democratic field, which has been struggling in single digits or less in polls, the disruption at the top has provided a shred of hope that they might still be able to break out in one of the early-voting states.
""One or two people are going to emerge out of that second tier and be viable because I don't think that the top tier is so strong that they can lock this down,"" said Aaron Pickrell, who helped run Obama's two winning presidential efforts in Republican-leaning Ohio. Asked about the general election, he admitted, ""I'm still nervous about all of it.""
Democratic Party rules are set to narrow access to the November and December debates, possibly excluding candidates such as Klobuchar, former housing secretary Julián Castro, former congressman Beto O'Rourke (Tex.) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii).
But many candidates may continue to campaign without debate access, betting on early-state voters to lift them from obscurity amid the impeachment turmoil. That is particularly true among those who see themselves as alternatives to Biden.
""There are some people who think it will fix the field where it is because it will take the oxygen away from the presidential campaign, and I doubt that is true,"" said Sen. Michael F. Bennet (Colo.), who polled at zero percent in the most recent Des Moines Register poll in Iowa. ""I think the big thing that is shifting is that the voters in these early states really for the first moment are beginning to pay attention to the race. Everything up to now has been preseason.""
Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio), another struggling candidate, said he has newfound interest from donors worried about Biden's campaign and Warren's ideology, and recently was meeting with newly interested donors in Los Angeles. He's also putting together meetings in New York.
""For us, I think there's new life into the campaign because of that,"" he said.
""I've been saying how fluid this is,"" he added. ""It's just wide open, and uncertainty of impeachment adds to it.""

Internal and external economic policy advisers are trying to help Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) design a way to finance a single-payer Medicare-for-all health-care system that would place every American on a government insurance program.
Warren has promised more details within weeks, but her team faces a challenge in crafting a plan that would bring in large amounts of revenue while not scaring off voters with big middle-class tax increases.
The proposal could cost more than $30 trillion over 10 years. Complicating matters, she has already committed all of the money she would raise from a new wealth tax, close to $3 trillion over 10 years, to several other ideas, including child care and student debt cancellation. This has limited the Warren campaign's options for finding additional sources of revenue without affecting middle-class Americans.
Bharat Ramamurti, a longtime Warren aide who served on the Senate Banking Committee, is widely seen as spearheading the single-payer financing plan for the campaign, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning.
""They want to figure out - with one go - how to stop the 'How are you going to pay for it?' question,"" one outside economic adviser said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss the campaign's thinking. ""She wants something airtight but easy to understand.""
A big question facing her next decision is whether the plan can be designed in a way that finances new health benefits without imposing large new costs on middle-class families.
Other presidential candidates from both parties have often floated economic proposals, both spending increases and tax cuts, but refused to fill in key details. President Trump, for example, promised in 2016 to eliminate the federal debt but also pledged to wall off Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security from cuts, a platform that many budget experts said was mathematically impossible.
Since becoming president, Trump has stuck to his promise to protect Medicare from cuts but has sought to cut Medicaid and Social Security benefits. And the debt has grown markedly in the past two years, rising above $22 trillion.
While other candidates have sought ambiguity, Warren has prided herself on the granularity of her ideas. This has brought her Medicare-for-all plan under sharper scrutiny, raising the stakes surrounding her current challenge.
As she has risen in the polls, her Democratic rivals have pressed her to explain how she would finance the health-care plan.
Warren, who opposed single-payer in her 2012 Senate run, said her Medicare-for-all financing plan has been ""months and months"" in the making. She is widely expected to release it ahead of the next Democratic presidential debate. A campaign spokeswoman would not share any details of what is under consideration but said a plan would be released in the next several weeks. The spokeswoman added the campaign has made no final decisions.
Several ideas have surfaced as Warren faces the high-stakes decision.
Robert Pollin, a left-leaning economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who has worked with the Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) teams, said he believes two-thirds of the single-payer fund can be raised by redirecting existing public health-care spending from Medicare, Medicaid and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Pollin refused to discuss any details related to his conversations with Warren's campaign.

Pollin suggests that the remaining third be raised by a $600 billion annual ""gross receipts"" tax on businesses, which he says would be less than the $650 billion that firms currently spend on health care; a 3.75 percent sales tax on ""nonnecessities"" that exempts low-income households, to raise an additional $200 billion; and a 0.38 percent tax on wealth above $1 million, which he says would raise the remaining $200 billion.
Robert C. Hockett, a Cornell University professor who has also advised Warren and Sanders, said he has urged Warren's team to propose financing Medicare-for-all in part with a ""public premium"" that would function similarly to a tax. Under this idea, Warren would propose raising revenue for a Medicare-for-all fund from a premium charge that would go to the government rather than a private insurance company.

Medicare-for-all supporters say their plan would save most Americans money by using the bargaining power created by having one government insurer to force health-care providers to lower prices.
""I told them what they should do is say, 'we will have a low premium that will replace a high premium - or if you prefer, a low public tax to replace a high private tax,' "" Hockett said. ""That would neutralize the word 'tax' because it would remind people that a tax is a synonym for a premium, and then at that point you are quibbling over words.""

Warren's team has also received recommendations to adopt a ""progressive consumption tax"" to help fund the proposal, according to a person with knowledge of the suggestion and spoke on the condition of anonymity. This plan would raise trillions of dollars for the new national health-care system by taxing consumption of goods and services, and could exempt those at the bottom of the income distribution to be less onerous on the working class than the ""value-added tax"" common in Europe.

A fourth idea that has been suggested is for Warren to sell her Medicare-for-all plan as a tax cut, by comparing how much families save by having their health-care costs lowered, according to another independent economic adviser to the Warren campaign, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly.
It is unclear if any of these proposals is likely to ultimately be proposed by Warren's campaign or if they will pick a different approach.
Warren's more centrist rivals have attacked her for not acknowledging single-payer would lead to middle-class tax hikes, with Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., calling her position on the question ""extremely evasive.""
But the public appetite for dramatic action on health care may be strong. A Bankrate.com survey released this week found that health care is the most important financial concern for Americans in the 2020 election.
""It drives me nuts when people say this is so complicated. It's not,"" Pollin said. ""The basics are very simple.""

Dow gave up September gains - and then some; Nasdaq, S&P 500 drop
October's history as an irascible month for stocks remained intact in its first two days as markets plunged on fears both real and imagined.
The Dow Jones industrial average gave up all its September gains and then some, plunging nearly 500 points Wednesday to push its losses to more than 800 points for the month. Technology received the biggest shellacking Wednesday, with Intel, Visa, Apple and Cisco running in the deep red.
The pullback's immediate cause was Tuesday's dismal manufacturing report, but fears of an economic slowdown, complications over Brexit and never-ending global trade anxiety weighed on investors.
""October's reputation is preceding itself,"" said Sam Stovall of CFRA Research. ""Historically, October has witnessed 30 percent higher volatility than the average month.""
The Dow blue chips slumped 494 points, or 1.9 percent, to close at 26,078. Wednesday's mayhem followed a rocky start Tuesday, which saw a 344-point drop after the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index signaled that September was the worst month for U.S. manufacturing in more than a decade. Tuesday wiped out all of September's market gains. The Dow's two-day loss comes to about 3.1 percent. The blue chip 30 is 4.7 percent off its all-time closing high in July 2019.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and Nasdaq composite index closed down, marking the worst day for stocks since Aug. 23. The broad S&P 500 dropped 53 points, or 1.8 percent, to close at 2,887 on the day. The S&P's two-day loss comes to 3 percent. All 11 stock market sectors went negative, led by the industrials and the information sector. The S&P 500 is 4.6 percent below its all-time closing high last July.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq gave up 123 points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 7,785. The Nasdaq is more than 6 percent off its all-time closing high in July.
Analysts were finding it difficult to put an exact cause on the sell-off. Some referred to October itself as a jinx month that hosted historic crashes in 1929, 1987, 1997 and during the Great Recession. The month also is known for being a ""bottom"" for bear markets that have then reversed and turned upward.
Others even speculated that reports about presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders's health might have sparked the sell-off. Some on Wall Street fear that his Democratic rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren would be unfriendly to Wall Street if she claimed the White House.
""It is all speculation on the source of weakness in the near term,"" said Nancy Tengler of Tengler Wealth Management. ""Manufacturing was disappointing. Job growth is slowing. In the very short term, the algorithms are reading the headlines and the sell programs are taking over. I am not panicking yet.""
President Trump blamed the volatility on ""all of this impeachment nonsense, which is going nowhere."" In a tweet midday Wednesday, he insisted the inquiry was ""driving the Stock Market, and your 401K's down. But that is exactly what the Democrats want to do. They are willing to hurt the Country, with only the 2020 Election in mind!""
Trump's tweet marked the second time in two days that he has punted the blame for negative economic news. On Tuesday, in the wake of the dismal manufacturing report, he tweeted that Federal Reserve Board Chair ""Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve have allowed the Dollar to get so strong, especially relative to ALL other currencies, that our manufacturers are being negatively affected.""
""Fed Rate too high. They are their own worst enemies, they don't have a clue. Pathetic!"" he wrote.
American consumers have been the cornerstone of the economy, but there are concerns that confidence could start to slip. U.S. vehicle sales for Ford Motor Co. declined 4.9 percent during the third quarter, the company said Wednesday, with demand for the top-selling F-series pickup starting to slouch. Its stock had shed 4 percent by midday Wednesday.
The National Retail Federation is set to present its perspective Thursday when it releases its holiday shopping season forecast.
This week's sell-off is echoing 2018's fourth-quarter mayhem. Stocks last year hit their high on Oct. 4 before beginning a three-month, 20-percent slide that culminated on Dec. 26.
Washington, D.C., investor Michael Farr warned that chain of events could be repeated unless calmed minds prevail. ""Investors need to be as data-dependent as the Federal Reserve, and these appear to be emotional swings,"" he said. ""The consumer represents 70 percent of gross domestic product and is still seeing wage gains and continuing to spend. That is positive data, and we need to be careful that we don't talk ourselves into an unnecessary bear market.""
The impeachment tumult comes as economists grow increasingly concerned about the year-long trade war between the United States and China, and weakening economic guideposts.
""There is no end in sight to this slowdown, the recession risk is real,"" Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, told clients in an email Tuesday.The European markets were on a downturn, with the London's FTSE sliding more 3.2 percent; the German DAX shedding 2.8 percent and the French CAC 40 falling 3.1 percent.

There are moments in every presidential nomination contest when many strategists, donors and activists can more easily explain why each of the candidates can't win the nomination or the presidency rather than which ones can. That this feeling has begun to grip some Democrats at a time when things are going so badly for President Trump, however, is not at all typical.
On paper, the field of candidates running for the Democratic nomination is everything the party's rank and file might hope for. It is big, offering more choices than ever. It is experienced, with candidates from every level of government and beyond. It includes more women and minorities than ever at a time when their voices are redefining the party. It is generationally and geographically diverse.
Yet, to date, there's been little that has given Democrats the confidence that their nomination process will produce a challenger strong enough, appealing enough and politically skilled enough to withstand what will be a brutal general election against a weakened and vulnerable president. Trump's campaign is already running a general election loaded with cash and with months of time to try to shape voters' perceptions of Democrats negatively before their nominee is even selected.
For Democrats, almost everything about the past week should be grounds for optimism about the political landscape. The litany of things that happened to or were done by the president in just a few days is beyond comprehension, starting with the case that Trump used the powers of his office to try to damage a political opponent that is at the heart of the House impeachment inquiry.
That case against the president appeared to gain strength, with closed-door testimony on Capitol Hill, and it was helped when acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said there was a quid pro quo involving military aid. Mulvaney later retracted the statement, but the damage was done.
That came on the same day that it was announced that Trump had awarded next summer's Group of Seven meeting to his Doral resort in Florida, boldly using the powers of his office to enhance his own business fortunes. After intense criticism, however, he tweeted Saturday that Trump National Doral Miami would no longer host the summit.
Then there is the mess made by the Trump's hasty decision to withdraw U.S. forces in northern Syria, which allowed Turkey to begin an assault on Kurdish forces, once U.S. allies in the fight against the Islamic State. 
In one attempt to undo the damage, Trump sent a letter to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatening to inflict harm to Turkey's economy if Erdogan kept going. The language sounded as if it had been written by a make-believe tough guy rather than the president of the United States. 
A fragile cease-fire agreement later brokered with Erdogan by Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo brought some respite in the fighting but also gave Turkey much of what it was seeking. 
""Like two kids in a lot, you have got to let them fight, and then you pull them apart,"" Trump said at a Texas rally. Earlier he had dismissed the fighting as of no particular concern to the United States. Syria has ""got a lot of sand,"" he said. ""So there's a lot of sand they can play with.""
Among those strengthened in the Middle East were the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. A meeting in the White House called with congressional leaders to discuss Syria turned into a showdown between an angry president and a resistant house speaker, Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif). He called her a ""third-grade politician."" She bristled and wondered why, with Trump and his policies, ""all roads lead to Putin.""
By week's end, Trump's Syria missteps had been denounced in a critical Washington Post op-ed written by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).
So almost everything about the week was grounds for optimism for Democrats - except for one event, which was the fourth Democratic debate, held in Westerville, Ohio. That debate quickly faded from view, swept aside by the tidal forces of a president on the defensive. For some Democrats, the three-hour session simply added to questions about the party's fitness to win a general election.
Much of this is a result of the continued debate performances by former vice president Joe Biden. He has been effective at times. But the sum of Biden on the stage against his rivals has been underwhelming at best, disappointing to those who see him as the most capable of winning a general election. 
His poll numbers are holding up, but he has failed to consolidate the advantages he brought into the race. He has been unable to quiet questions about his readiness.
Into this vacuum has stepped Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). That she was the target for much of Tuesday's debate was all anyone needed to know about how her standing is perceived by her rivals. For others working to win the nomination, she is the person to stop but also someone they see as having vulnerabilities to exploit. 
Warren is a skilled and disciplined candidate, which is why she has risen while Biden has been static at best. She knows what she thinks and has a theory of how to get to the White House. Her agenda - which includes big, structural change - the cost and complexity of her proposed policies, and her unwillingness to say how it all adds up give many Democrats pause about her ability to win in November 2020. 
There are other choices, obviously. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), unabashed in his democratic socialist agenda, has the support of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), three of the most liberal new members of Congress. Some polls show him beating Trump in key states, though many Democrats are skeptical. 
South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg is young and heartland-based, a candidate who speaks eloquently in debates, interviews and in question periods with voters. He enjoys support from those in the party who are white and well-educated, but not yet with other voters that past nominees have needed to win the nomination, particularly African Americans. 
Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg are four of the 18 candidates still in the race. Could someone farther down in the pack, someone who isn't even qualifying for the debates, capture the nomination? It's not out of the question and surprises are always a part of the pre-Iowa, pre-New Hampshire campaign season. The hope for all those who are being ignored is to build quietly in Iowa and New Hampshire and get hot when the weather is at its coldest.
One small measure of the restlessness among at least some Democrats was a Sept. 28 tweet by Oprah Winfrey, which includes a short video clip of her talking with Bob Iger, chief executive of Walt Disney Co. 
""This is the man I wish was running for President of the USA,"" she tweeted. In the video, she tells Iger that, if he were running, ""I would be canvassing in Iowa right now. I would be going door-to-door … I wish … more than ever, every day, that you had done it.""
Put aside the question of whether Iger could win a Democratic nomination, let alone the presidency, or Winfrey's skills as a political handicapper. Her enthusiasm for someone not even in the biggest field of candidates ever assembled speaks to the degree to which the declared candidates have yet to capture imaginations, despite high levels of intensity among voters.
Because these kinds of concerns have happened before, and with some regularity, there is no reason to overstate the problem. Once voters check in and contests are held and someone begins to win primaries and caucuses decisively or consistently, perceptions of their strengths will change. 
But the campaign to date has produced questions that will demand answers. Can Biden step up and show something more than he has? Can Warren demonstrate that her proposals and campaign machine are enough to overcome reservations about her general election viability? Can a slipping Sanders rebound? Can Buttigieg or someone else who is less liberal than Warren or Sanders displace Biden? 
Trump might look like a weakened candidate, but he will be a tenacious campaigner, willing to do anything he can to demonize and defeat his challenger. Democrats have many choices but are anxiously wondering which one of them will get the party to the White House in 2021.

Most presidential hopefuls accused of failing to engage with a key 2020 voter bloc

When the Latino Community Foundation sent questionnaires to the Democratic presidential candidates asking where they stood on issues such as education, health care and immigration, 

the result was hardly what it anticipated: no response at all.


Even after the deadline was extended, nine out of 15 candidates, including former vice president Joe Biden, did not submit answers.
When the League of United Latin American Citizens, the country's oldest Hispanic civil rights group, invited Pete Buttigieg to events in Milwaukee and Des Moines, the South Bend, Ind., mayor declined. When the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials held a summit this summer, Biden and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) did not attend. Both passed up a second chance to address the legislators in the fall.
'It's always scheduling,' NALEO chief executive Arturo Vargas said of their explanations. 'But you know, scheduling is a reflection of your priorities.'
Hispanics are increasingly influential in the Democratic Party and in general-election contests, but leaders and activists say they feel ignored and misunderstood by candidates who have spent much of their time focusing on Iowa and New Hampshire, predominantly white states at the top of the nominating calendar. They are bluntly calling on party leaders to reconsider the voting order of the states in four years.
Last week's Democratic presidential debate in California, an important primary state where the population is nearly 40-percent Latino, put an exclamation point on their outrage. Many had hoped it would showcase the rising influence of Hispanics. Instead, the only Hispanic in the race, former housing and urban development secretary Julián Castro, failed to qualify to be on the debate stage, and the participating candidates devoted little time to highlighting how their ideas would affect Latino communities.

Many fear that Democrats are also squandering a unique opportunity to boost Hispanic voter turnout in the general election. Shifting demographics and a backlash against President Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies have given Democrats an opening in diversifying battleground states from Arizona to Pennsylvania. But Latino officials fear that a primary contest that often feels far removed from Hispanic communities could blunt excitement for the November election.
'At this stage in the game, we are well beyond talking about missed opportunities,' said Clarissa Martínez de Castro, the deputy vice president for policy and advocacy at UnidosUS, the country's largest Latino civil rights and advocacy group. 'This is seriously in the territory of political malpractice.'



Some Latino leaders and voters are more confident that anger with Trump will drive turnout in November far more than the course of the Democratic primaries will. Still, even they want to see their party's candidates do more to connect with Hispanic communities.
'None of them really stand out,' said Jesús Medina, 37, an undecided voter who attended a Spanish-language town hall hosted by top surrogates of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Medina said he was seeking something that 'doesn't sound like the same old politician talk.'



Although Latino leaders are demanding greater attention, Hispanic voters have not rallied around one of their own as a candidate. Castro has failed to crack the top tier even in heavily Latino states such California and Nevada, showing that his struggles are not limited to the less-diverse states whose primaries come before the California and Nevada contests.


Latinos are poised to make a significant general election impact in the Sun Belt, the Rust Belt and parts of the South, including closely contested states seen as crucial in 2020. On average, there was a near doubling last year in the number of Latino voters ages 25 to 34 in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania, according to an analysis by Univision.
Hispanics are projected to account for more than 13-percent of eligible voters in 2020, surpassing all other ethnic minority groups, according to a Pew Research Center study. After years in which turnout by Hispanics disappointed Democrats, their participation in the 2018 midterm elections was up 13 percent from 2014, and about 7 in 10 voted for Democratic candidates in House races.

There have been bright spots in the primary campaign, activists said. Many applauded Sanders's outreach to Hispanic communities "" his popularity among young voters, who are more likely to be nonwhite than older voters, has helped him broaden his reach "" and his populist economic pitch. Castro received high marks for focusing sharply on issues that matter to Latino voters. But mostly, there has been much more cause for concern than celebration.
'I would characterize the overall campaign, with a few exceptions, as really disappointing, in terms of their engagement,' said NALEO's Vargas, who said he felt the debate did nothing to improve the situation. 'I think there have been some who have really done some missteps when it comes to trying to engage Latinos, or ignoring them, frankly.'
Many activists put Buttigieg, who has jumped to the top of the polls in Iowa, at the top of that list. The candidate has also struggled to appeal to African American voters.
'Buttigieg is basically nonexistent in the Latino community,' said Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), a member of the leadership of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who supported Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) when she was a candidate for the Democratic nomination.

On a trip to California last month, Buttigieg was asked at a forum hosted by Latino and immigrant groups whether he would be willing to commit troops to Mexico, with its consent, to help it fight violent drug cartels.
'There is a scenario where we could have security cooperation, as we do with countries around the world. Now, I would only order American troops into conflict if there were no other choice, if American lives were on the line,' Buttigieg replied, adding that he would need Mexico's support.
When California state Sen. María Elena Durazo heard that from Buttigieg, she was shocked, believing his words would upset many Latinos.
Durazo, an influential former union leader who is Mexican American, recalled a 'bit of a gasp' in the crowd after Buttigieg's remarks. The long history of troops being used against Mexicans in the Southwest made Buttigieg's comments especially tone-deaf, in her view.
'I think he really didn't get that even with a full explanation, what a shocking thing it was to hear, ' said Durazo, who has not made a presidential endorsement.
From the perspective of Domingo Garcia, the president of LULAC, whose invitations for Buttigieg to appear before his group were declined, 'there's been, like, no outreach from his campaign to the Latino community.'
The Buttigieg campaign defended its efforts, noting that the candidate met with the top official at UnidosUS and that staff members have met with representatives of leading Latino groups. Buttigieg recently released a plan for the Latino community that would create a fund to invest in Latino-owned businesses.
'As Pete continues to lay out his bold vision to address our country's challenges in a way that unites the American people, we're going to continue to meet people where they are and work to earn their support and draw people into this movement and build a bigger coalition,' said Buttigieg spokesman Chris Meagher.
Other candidates have faced similar heat. Biden, who put his tenure as Barack Obama's vice president at the center of his platform, has encountered criticism over the administration's deportations of some 3-million undocumented immigrants. Protesters have demanded that he apologize, and lawmakers have sought clarity on his position.
Responding to these concerns, Biden's campaign recently released an immigration proposal that featured rare acknowledgment of the suffering Obama's policies caused. 'Joe Biden understands the pain felt by every family across the U.S. that has had a loved one removed from the country, including under the Obama-Biden Administration,' the plan said.

Appearing at a recent culinary union town hall in Las Vegas, Biden was asked what he would do differently from Obama and Trump. 'A lot,' he responded. Biden said he would focus on deporting only those who have committed serious crimes. The crowd applauded.
Biden's level of participation in events and other initiatives has also drawn concerns. Christian Arana of the Latino Community Foundation said he sent the Democratic campaigns a questionnaire in November with a deadline of completing it by Dec. 11. After no campaign sent a response, Arana, the LCF's policy director, extended the deadline to Dec. 15. Arana said he received replies from Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Buttigieg, Castro and Booker, but not Biden. Later, the billionaire activist Tom Steyer replied.
Biden's team said it was not slighting the groups that have invited him to their events or sought his thoughts. 'While we greatly respect the leadership of the organizations, and the organizations themselves, we have to be very strategic in the use of our principal's time,' said Cristóbal Alex, a senior adviser to Biden and former president of the Latino Victory Fund.
The campaign said it is making overtures to Latino voters in numerous ways. When Biden launched his campaign, his team had prepared an ad in Spanish as well as a translated version of his website. The campaign said it plans to run ads on Spanish-language TV and radio in Nevada early next year. Biden also won the endorsement this week of Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), the chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus's political action committee.
As complaints have mounted about other candidates for the Democratic nomination, Sanders has without fanfare been building a base of support in Latino communities. He has won plaudits for his aggressive outreach, especially in California, which advanced its primary to March-3 and is expected to play a bigger role in determining the nominee. Last week, he held a rally in San Diego just miles from the southern border.
'Sanders continues to probably have the best Latino outreach so far,' Garcia said.

Analilia Mejia, Sanders's political director, said the campaign mapped out 'different organizations and groups and spaces in which voters organize themselves, Latino voters in particular.' She added, 'We took the time to engage and connect with hundreds of community leaders across the country, not just the early states.'
Mejia said she recently joined Sanders at a pair of meetings that included Spanish-speaking Latino activists. She said she translated for the senator, who understands some Spanish but doesn't speak the language. She also joined an exclusively Spanish-language town hall in Las Vegas on Saturday, fielding questions after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who is of Puerto Rican descent, gave a keynote speech in Spanish.
Still, Sanders, who identifies as a democratic socialist, has his own vulnerabilities. In Florida, where many Latinos have family members who fled oppressive Latin American regimes, some Democrats have expressed concerns about his rhetoric. Earlier this year, Sanders's refusal to label Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro a dictator was controversial; his vote against an immigration overhaul bill in 2007 has haunted him in the past.
Warren is still introducing herself to Latino voters, activists said. Her campaign has hired senior Latina staffers to lead operations in California, Texas, Florida and Massachusetts. The campaign has also held Spanish-language organizing events. But like others, she is mostly focused on the first two states.
'The whole process, you know, starting in Iowa, New Hampshire, states with limited Latino populations,' said former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, who is Hispanic and ran for president in 2008. 'I would hope there is a reassessment after the next election.'

Kamala D. Harris says if Congress doesn't impose new gun-control rules in her first 100 days as president, she'll do it herself. Elizabeth Warren promises to unilaterally ban drilling on public lands. Bernie Sanders tells crowds he'll use executive action to reinstate Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals as part of immigration reform.
Even Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar, who are running on their ability to forge compromises with Republicans, envision single-handed presidential edicts to tackle issues including climate change and gun violence.
As the Democratic candidates offer plan after plan, many are promising single-handed presidential action - rather than new laws that must be pushed through a sluggish Congress - to combat the nation's big problems.
That trend was particularly evident at a gun-control forum in Las Vegas on Wednesday, where almost every candidate who spoke has promised some kind of executive action to bolster gun control.
""Durable reform requires legislation - but right now legislation is impossible,"" Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, wrote in releasing her gun plan in August. ""Why? A virulent mix of corruption and abuse of power.""
The unilateral approach in some ways echoes President Trump's strategy, even as Democrats increasingly label him an authoritarian. The Democrats' policies would not amplify presidential power to the extent that Trump has sought to, but they do reflect a more president-centric approach to governing, a feature that's become central to Trump's tenure.
While the question of presidential authority is now at center stage, the popularity of executive action in both parties began growing years ago, analysts say, driven by a growing tension between voters demanding dramatic change and a Congress increasingly paralyzed by partisanship and polarization. 
The Democratic hopefuls whose messages are more revolutionary - Warren, Sanders, a senator from Vermont, and perhaps Harris, a senator from California - are emphasizing executive action more than those who foresee a return to bipartisan cooperation. In some ways, the issue is drawing a line between candidates, such as former vice president Biden, who see Trump as an aberration, and those who believe the days of bipartisan comity may not return any time soon. 
Some lawmakers warn that the trend could distort the balance of powers. Biden, who served in the Senate for 36 years, is among those arguing that the legislative process, cumbersome though it may be, forces the parties to work together in ways that benefit the country.
""[The Constitution] says you have to get a consensus to get anything done,"" he told reporters in June. ""And if you can't get a consensus, guess what? Power flows to the president, and abuse of power takes place."" Regarding the Democrats, he added, ""The idea that we're going to come along and do the same thing [Trump] did? Not on my watch."" 
But even Biden's platform includes promises such as ""on day one, Biden will sign a series of new executive orders with unprecedented reach"" to tackle climate change. 
Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., made a slightly different argument against executive action at that gun-control forum Wednesday when he argued that gun control is among those issues ""too important to be left to the whim of an individual president."" 
""Because an executive action can be reversed - and because an overwhelming majority of American people want this to get done anyway - I really feel that legislation is the best way forward,"" he said.
Presidents dating to George Washington have used executive action, some to seismic effect. Franklin D. Roosevelt used his powers to implement key parts of the New Deal. Harry S. Truman's Executive Order 9981 integrated the U.S. Armed Forces. Both had faced congressional opposition that precluded the passage of legislation to achieve their goals.
""As long as you have a divided government, you'll have executive action,"" said Elaine Kamarck, who worked in the Clinton administration and now directs the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution. ""You can think of it as poor man's legislation.""
But in recent years, executive action has become an increasingly common substitute for legislation. Presidents often say they're being forced to act because of Congress's paralysis. As the Senate and House have become more polarized, they have struggled to enact major bills - prompting presidential edicts on issues such as immigration and health care.
The result can be a whiplash, where each new president enacts sweeping policies only to have them abruptly reversed when the opposition takes over. That's been most evident in the much-reversed ""global gag rule,"" a provision banning foreign organizations that get U.S. aid from providing abortions or talking about them.
""A Democrat comes in and says, 'Yes, we will give foreign aid to entities that perform abortions.' . . . The Republicans come in and they say, 'No, we're not doing that,' "" Kamarck said. ""So things like abortion become like a ping-pong ball.""
The ping-pong balls will probably increase, if Democratic rhetoric on the campaign trail is any indication. In the last debate, Harris was asked about Biden's charge that she and others were following Trump's damaging example by promising sweeping presidential actions, some of which might not be constitutional.
Harris didn't directly rebut the criticism. But talking to reporters at the New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention last month
, she spoke of Congress's failure to tackle ""some of the longest-standing issues that are challenging our country."" 
""If the United States Congress fails to act, absolutely I'm prepared to take executive action,"" she said. ""And that will be no different than previous presidents of the United States.""
In contrast, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who like Biden touts himself as a centrist who can work with Republicans, sees limits to what executive action can achieve, because by definition it shuts out the opposition.
""I think that executive orders can play a critical role,"" Bullock said. ""But you can't assume you're going to lead for four years - if you're actually going to lead - just by executive action. . . . You're not going to be able to substantially and sustainably move things forward if it's just by executive order.""
Harris, saying ""elections matter,"" argues that immediate corrective action will be needed after Trump leaves office. Many Democrats consider the Trump presidency a crisis that requires an emergency response, and they've been frustrated as the president uses his powers to do things such as transfer funds to build a U.S.-Mexico border barrier or enact rules aimed at weakening the Affordable Care Act.
Harris and other candidates often say they will ask Congress to pass certain bills and will issue an executive order only if it fails to do so.
But while the candidates often talk about issuing executive actions as though it's like waving a magic presidential wand, the reality is more complicated. For all their reach and impact, executive orders cover only the activities of the federal government and its workforce, and they can take time to implement.
Harris's proposed order expanding background checks on gun buyers, for example, would not instantly change the system. Instead, it would direct the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to change its interpretation of the current law requiring gun dealers to conduct background checks.
By directing ATF to classify as ""dealers"" even those who sell as few as five guns a year for profit, Harris would significantly expand the number of people covered. That would have a big effect - but the next GOP president could undo Harris's action immediately upon taking office. 
The fight over executive action has been brewing for some time, as each new president pushes the envelope a little further. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Democrats excoriated President George W. Bush for his expansion of national security powers. 
Obama then issued 276 executive orders in his eight years in office. That was fewer than other recent two-term presidents, but Republicans criticized the scope of Obama's actions, such as establishing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program - a sweeping bid to end the deportation of those brought to the United States illegally as children. 
When Trump took office, he seized on executive orders with particular gusto, staging televised signing ceremonies to suggest bold action on promises such as banning travel from some Muslim-majority countries. 
As Trump has tested the limits of presidential power, parts of his orders have been found unconstitutional, and some are still being litigated. Trump, propelled to office by voters looking to shake up the system, has issued 125 executive orders since his inauguration, according to the Federal Register.
Now it's Democratic voters who are demanding immediate change, suggesting that for all their temporariness and shaky status, the appeal of executive actions continues to resonate with a restless electorate. 
""Look at what happens in the first few weeks of the last two or three presidential administrations,"" said Phillip J. Cooper, professor of public administration at Portland State University and author of ""By the Order of the President."" ""They walk in the door and in a period of about two months, they issue a large number of these things, to try to show their constituents that they are indeed responding to what they ran on.""
